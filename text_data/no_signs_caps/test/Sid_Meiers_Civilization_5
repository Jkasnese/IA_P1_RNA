 played as arabia on a large earth map  started in europe with brasil below me  captured brasils capital city because it look nice  turtled half the game before finding out i was coming second  russia was first  the only one between me and victory  russia wiped out egypt and japan which were around kazakhstan  russia has a army 3 times the size of mine  russia has like 30 citys with 2000 gold per turn  russias capital is in the middle of those 30 citys  russia was sill ahead in tech  operation cold war was now in effect  allied with korea who was above turkey and city states near russia to use as a shields  sent 2 nukes along with a fleet of 15 ships across the world to get as close to the capital as possible  still wasnt close enough  russias finish half the space ship  sent xcom squads to the city states closest to the capital  attack  que skyrim music  sent ships into the sea of okhotsk  oh crap russia was prepared  was met with a blockade of nuclear submarines  but the nukes must go through  punched a hole in the blockade with my ships  my ships sinking left and right  sent the cruiser with the nukes as far in as possible  russias got 3 turn left on her last spaceship part  the range on the bombs is just close enough  fire the nukes  send in the xcom squads  captured russias capital  no ships made it out though their sacrifices will be honored  most intense battle i ever fought  one turn later and france wins a cultural victory  what the hell france great game 8510

i am the peaceful nation of the celts we shall be the nation of religion and of diplomacy this went well we ended up next to the babylonians and we expanded nicely in peace however i have always believed in dibs so i placed down glasgow onto the land between us to provide a little buffer they seemed annoyed by this a few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years but otherwise nothing too bad happened in order to spread our religion further because we were known for our confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster we begin to invest in boats soon we covered the oceans in missionaries inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies babylon was making friends with a local city state genoa however they were trying to spread zoroastrianism those heathens despite both our religions being known for their peace we passiveaggressively sent missionary and inquisitor to genoa over the course of about 700 years we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions those same warriors had been given spears now but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders i offer babylon some sugar for their spice they wanted my sugar iron coal and all of my money i then asked germany if they wanted sugar for spice they accepted north of me rome had begun a war with france due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade i found myself with a huge amount of money everytime france and rome made peace i knew that rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes so i bought i gifted many city states my religion and gold and then i bought gifted france and germany enough money to declare with with rome while they fought my spearmen now musketmen continued to glare with babylons and we continued our 1500 year religious passiveaggression over genoa they said i was spying on them i said i wouldnt when my spies returned i sent them back to babylon a squad of 5 great prophets charged into babylon converting left right and centre babylon complained i was being a bit aggressive i apologised i then sent more missionaries to babylon i had now found every single civilization we decided to have a united nations meeting in 1600ad i as the host gave everyone a single vote except myself i gave myself 16 due to my popularity i declared my religion to be the world religion every one opposed i listened to their opinions and then passed it anyway when rome got angry about this i then paid france to declare war again when babylon got angry i then paid rome to declare war on them my civilians were amazingly happy hugely more than any other place but because i was an emperor they declared me declis the terrible despite my universal healthcare happy citizens peaceful religion not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word my army consisted of mostly my friends my city states and my musketmen now great war infantry continued to glare at the babylonian great war infantry after 2000 years a great duty to my nation their descendants shall continue to frown at the babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall eventually we reached a grand united nations meeting i sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 city state friends and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side i said that the peoples confucian republican empire of scotland was the best nation in the world they all voted against me i smiled and then declared i won anyway democracy is overrated freedom of religion only applies to my religion i dont need to be stronger when im more popular and my people are probably more beautiful and if you dont like me ill pay your best friend to backstab you through this i came to understand american foreign policy so civilization is if nothing else an educational tool

civilization v is the thinking mans game it doesnt require lightning reflexes speed or precision however it is probably one of the most complex games ever created youre able to pick one of many civilizations to guide from 4000bc to the present allowing you to shape their culture military and economic structure among others you control everything from where to build a city how you allocate resources scientific research religion espionage tourism corporations and more the game has an extremely intricate diplomacy system as well which allows for you to befriend or antagonize the other civilizations there are multiple ways to win a game allowing for multiple playstyles as someone who has been playing the civilization games for over 20 years i strongly recommend civilization v with all of its dlc civilization v has also made our list for the top 35 games of the generation to see where it ranks heres the video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdwihmom_lp4 if you enjoyed this review feel free to follow me as a steam curator httpstoresteampoweredcomcurator4886473

cantstopplayingarrrgggg very addictive and deep it has grown wonderfully over the years and has great support from the steam workshop endless replayability if you are new to the series have no worries good ol sid will do you no wrong as the tutorials will have you conquring mongol hordes and smacking down washingtons smarmyness in no time flat hours will fly by and your social life will suffer if you are a vetran of the series and have been holding out check out the two expantion packs which add many interesting dynamics to gameplay easily making this the most exciting and in depth of the franchise ive had several friends sit down at my screen and start a new game dispite them groaning about it not being an action game or something like candy crush we all know the types needless to say coming back and seeing how they were doing 3 hours later and noticing that they havnt changed position on their chair has always been a moment that makes me smile i have spread the addiction huzzah do yourself a favor play this game

gandhi declares war on bismarcks german empire soon after gandhi strikes berlin hamburg and essen with nuclear missiles the ottomans concerned with gandhis warmongering denounce the indian leader they soon lose their capital bismarck his economy and army in ruins pleads for peace with the indian empire but gandhi will only stop with full annexation of the german reich an alliance of poland gengis khans mongolian empire and the aztecs turn on gandhi in hopes of stopping his rampage warsaw falls karakorum falls tenochtitlan falls gandhi reins supreme the world is in his grasp he is on the verge of doing what men for thousands of years have dreamed of conquering the world under one banner but none of that matters because the babylonians have just won a space victory by launching a single little rocket into space it makes too much sense 1010 but be warned gandhi will find you gandhi will kill you and gandhi always gets his kill

you know that feeling when you get up from a little power nap and realize you were sleeping for 8 hours thats this game but instead of getting rid of stress its full of it in all reality however sid meiers civilization v manages to feel like a board game you start with 1 big piece and you try to control the board in sense the game is rather welcome to new players almost everything is or can be automated you might get confused for a bit but soon youll be nuking gandhi like a pro but take heed however if you automate your workers which youll find yourself doing the first couple games they will build farms everywhere i have no idea if this is a fetish of some kind for them but they do this means first timers who want to automate should build a tall empire to explain a tall empire consists of few cities but each has a high population if you build too many cities with too many farms your population will make your city unhappy now for a synopsis of the game sid meiers civilization v has many objects of importance these are below if you already know how the game plays skip this section [g]  gold gold is your main income gold is used for trades bribing citystates and the purchase of units or buildings it can also be used to purchase tiles a good income leads to a good empire fact george washington is the only leader who affects the purchase of tiles at least in vanilla [f]  food food increases how quickly your city grows the more food the faster if you run out of food your citizens will starve until you have enough to sustain them [c]  culture culture is used to adopt social policies and grow out your borders culture is given to you 1 per turn at the games start which is why monuments and other such buildings increase culture some social policies also give culture or other benefits once you reach a certain preordained amount of culture you may choose a policy remember for every city you found culture cost is increased by 15% before youre allowed to get a new policy you can also achieve a victory by adopting 5 social policies to the end of their branches in vanilla or through tourism in brave new world [h]  happiness happiness is weird first time players might see it as somewhat redundant at face value the only thing it blatantly tells you is how close you are to a golden age which increase [g] and [p] which ill get to later however an unhappy empire grows at 14 its normal speed and a livid empire grows even slower weakens your units and makes [p] plummet each city you found increases unhappiness and your population does too if the people are unhappy the empire will fall [p]  production this is the amount of uh build you have per turn in essence its how quickly you build your units buildings and wonders production can be increased by the terrain around you and by buildings like the workshop the more production the better [s]  science science is the big thing of civilization your empire starts at least in vanilla with agriculture already researched this means you can build farms but you cry at the silly reviewer on your screen if i only have farms whats all this stuff about workshops well hold your mouth my um civlings science is used to research in a set number of turns whatever you selected to research is unlocked and you get whatever bonuses come packed with it this can be units buildings wonders perks projects or more science is one of the most important aspects of this game science can also unlock a victory but its rather difficult you must first unlock all science projects build the apollo program wonder and then build multiple spaceship parts these parts must then be moved to your capital and added to your spaceship once you have all of them you win [cs]  citystates citystates are nonplayer civilizations which cant win the game they have units roughly around the era of the most futuristic era of any player and while they are only 1 city each they can be bribed for influence get ready for one of the most annoying factors of the game upon bribing a citystate with 250 gold they become friendly giving you various perks however bribing them once more makes them your ally they gift you all resources they have give you more perks and they declare war on enemies youre fighting or that fight you since citystates are about twice as much as normal civilizations in number allying yourself with many makes you a mighty force if you manage to build the united nations wonder unlocked with science very late in the game you can initiate a vote for world peace in doing so citystates allied with you vote for you if you get the required number of votes you win [bb]  barbarians barbarians spawn in small camps they simply harass you if you get onto an encampment tile you remove it and get some gold leaders like suleiman and bismarck can get barbarians to join you whereas askia can get triple gold from these camps holy god that was a lot if you read it all i applaud you now civilization v is a great game its fierce competition fun and overall an honestly fabulous title if youre a fan of turn based strategy and you dont own it get it as soon as possible its an amazing work that deserves the money you pay not only that but theres dlc that give religon and way more leaders to choose from now is the dlc worth your money in my opinion no it provides more leaders but changes or adds mechanics im not too fond of i truly think the original is better civilization v captivates you into a suprisingly educational experience i didnt expect heading into it you wont learn too much playing it but the civilopedia included in the game provides incredibly detailed backgrounds to leaders buildings technology citystates and more i urge you to buy this game even more now that beyond earth has come out just so you can see what civilization truly is the games mechanics art style historical accuracy and music blend together to form a game youll spend weeks playing again and again some people say its only worth it with expansions but this game is fine just how it is and in my humble opinion is one of the finest games ever crafted tldr buy it now you terrible person

civ 5 is the kind of game where you can try to be nice and befreind everyone but you will get denounced they will murder your people and pillage your cities when you attempt to fight back you are labeled a warmonger and obviously the only way to stop getting warmonger penalties is to slaughter all those that oppose you right if you destroy 1 civ might as well destroy them all because they will not let you live that down also ghandi destroyer of worlds will wreck you if you dont give him all your uranium for him to build nukes to nuke you with 1010 would fight ghandi destroyer of worlds again

having not a great deal of experience with previous civilization games i was expecting myself to find this installment of the series hard to get the hang of imagining myself spending hours trying to work out how to start up a civilization that will stand the test of time instead i found the game to be extremely helpful and newbiefriendly like other strategy games you learn the basics then gradually build up a better understanding of the game and its mechanics feeling more and more like a pro with every minute gone by after about four hours playing i felt pretty confident but even today i am learning things i never knew or had any comprehension of in the game the simplicity which has been introduced to help newcomers coupled with the fact that the game maintains the same look and feel with older generations is a really positive thing that was pulled off very well the game offers serious levels of depth due to the vast number of playable races multiple methods to seek victory and the ability to play on completely randomly generated maps every game with available templates to choose from if so desired i have only played a handful of games right to the very end since they can last for many days especially if each session isnt particularly long every game feels very different to the next providing this title with a lot of replayability the ai is sometimes criticised but i think that it is well done in this game with a large range of difficulty levels to choose from ranging from literally zero experience to the grandmaster level they can often be somewhat unpredictable but i personally see that as a good thing i mean whats the point in playing such an indepth strategic game like civilization v when you can anticipate what the ai will most likely do part of the magic of this game is that it immerses you into the position of a leader facing situations where you have to make decisions on the spot with no idea what your opponent is going to do overall this is a great game worthy of your money but i would advise waiting for it to come on sale as it frequently does it isnt the newest game in the world either

i was playing civ and i only just realized how amazing this game is after playing it for so long first allow me to set the mood the year was 1700something france the only civilization who was even close to challenging my might as the leader of the powerful empire of japan was being landgrabby and attacking my allies so i being the superpower that i was as leader of japan decided to ride in and knock him down a few pegs and by that i mean conquer five of his cities isolate his capital from the rest of the world annex three of the five cities we conquered and give the other two to my nearby allies the iroquois who razed one napoleon of course denounced me but the rest of the world was like japan saved our asses from your entitled ways so you can go  yourself shorty then i highfived the iroquois because hiawatha and i were besties fast forward 100 turns and roughly 200 ingame years napoleons grabbing land again but this time its the land of citystates around him because i decimated his military so badly that he honestly wouldve killed himself going after any major civs being the superpower that i am i immediately rush to the aid of these citystates but i realize that i cant afford to risk war because the other civs would start to think i was just abusing my power so i secretly provide the citystate budapest who is at this point in a state of permanent war with france with two mechanized infantry  a solid two ages ahead of frances cannons and horsemen budapest successfully repels the french invasion and becomes my ally i do the same with the citystate of stockholm when theyre attacked by darius who i previously attacked and captured one of the cities of because darius was an irrational entitled prick of a leader who had decided that everything to the west of his land aka my land is rightfully his stockholm to the east of darius successfully repels dariuss invasion but stockholm doesnt stop there apparently dariuss military is so incredibly weak that one of his own cities falls to stockholms new advanced technology stockholm razed the city i just kind of smirked at this point darius just got what was coming to him so i thought to myself ill go on my merry way making more and more citystates my allies and protecting them from the menace of france  and each other this system obviously works and these citystates supply me with enough that maintaining my relationships with them is well worth it fast forward a few turns and roughly ten ingame years my buddies the iroquois publically denounce me telling the entire world that im not to be trusted these were the guys who i not only saved from napoleon but gave two entire cities to i was of course angry but shrugged it off and kept going  i had a science victory to get to and couldnt let them get in my way and if i were to teach them a lesson for their irrational behavior it would only solidify their claims in the eyes of the rest of the world a science victory would require me to devote much more energy to the production of scientific advancements and certain buildings required to accomplish this goal than i would be able to afford if i had a war or two on my hands then i realized something  budapest had been churning out things like sams armored tanks rocket artillery things far beyond anyones technological progress but my own and giving most of it but by no means all of it to me their ally and sworn protector of course i didnt realize the implications of this until darius remember darius denounced me too i didnt think anything of it because that guy was always denouncing me but then i remembered when stockholm razed his city and something clicks  im singlehandedly responsible for that as well as the decimation of the french countryside by budapests new military forces which i also viewed as righteous retribution in a sense the french had been weakened so badly already but budapest was in a state of constant war with them even being passive and supplying them with resources and the occasional few pieces of gold was tearing france apart stockholms razing of dariuss city was because of me what i hadnt counted on was the iroquois realizing that for themselves let alone their negative reaction to it i mean i had been protecting the little guy maybe even the good guy the whole time stockholm wouldve been wiped out if i had just stood by and watched right but dariuss military was as i had proved too weak to wipe out a colony of ants without foreign aid and i had supplied their mortal enemies stockholm with ing armored tanks stockholm also happened to be right near hiawathas land and was never my ally despite the units i gave them in fact they had been marauding near the outskirts of the iroquois borders ever since i gave them the military technology they needed to defeat dariuss invasion i had singlehandedly thrown half the world into a state of complete and total chaos without even realizing it and even believed that i was a savior and that i had done a good deed ending with the complete and total ruination of not just half the world but even the alliances i had built up over hundreds of ingame years of diplomacy with all the other world leaders distrusting or blatantly loathing japan just the fact that this is possible in this game at such a low casual difficulty despite how simplistic the game appears on the surface is wonderful and i didnt even mention the gameplay the strategic depth the multiplayer the absolutelyingeverything  i could go on and on about this game every aspect is wonderful i love it i honestly cant bring myself to say anything bad about it  this is without question my favorite tbs game of all time ten out of ing ten absolutely brilliant edit i wrote this forever ago read like a year and as much as im cringing at my past selfs writing i still agree with it so that should tell you something about this game if youre still not convinced

sid meiers civilisation v  just one more turn  9  score comment graphics 8 visuals are simple but pleasing good textures on the landscape tiles nicely detailed units with lots of variety good animations and an intuitive unobtrusive ui zooming in and out on units cities and terrain allows you see all the little details while also giving you the ability to see the big picture strategic view graphics are vastly improved from previous games in the series if i had one wish i guess it would be to have your cities and their buildings represented better visually cities grow and spread with population and advance with technologyera and have several different styles depending on the nation you select and the building of wonders will add the wonder to the area surrounding your city but it would be great to have further customisation of your cities so you could really make them your own the civilopedia like an in game wiki is a little difficult to navigate and while informative could use some work audio 8 game music is relaxing and fitting from the dawn of civilisation the age of exploration or the grand age of empire building it just seems to work well and i very rarely feel the need to turn down the music volume as i do with other games the ambient sound is excellent move your screen to a coastal area and you will hear the wash of the sea select your boats and you will here the crack of oars or ring of their bell the little touches and details like these really make the game a joy to play gameplay 9 civilisation is a turn based 4x explore expand exploit exterminate game a game of grand strategy & micromanagement a game where the objective is to grown your civilisation and eventually conquer all through technology culture diplomacy and military might this is by no means a simple game it takes time to truly learn and fully appreciate but once you get into a game your hooked civilisation is by far the most addictive game maybe with the exception of certain mmorgps out there the just one more turn is a running joke because you will often find yourself planning on playing just one more turn to build something or win a battle and then you will look to the clock and find several hours have past the start of the game is exciting turns move quickly and you see your planning quickly realised mid game you must continue your expansion and put in place what you will need to win the only place where i feel this game falls down is late in the game by this point sometimes there will be a clear winner technology advancement will slow and your empire will often be so massive and units so numerous that just taking your turn can take quite a lot of time overall though gameplay is outstanding the ai can be a little quirky at times but for the most part is challenging and tactically sound relationships between civilisations are all based on their predisposition and events which occur throughout the game and can therefore be somewhat predictable story 8 the story of history rewritten the story of civilisation so many details make up this game and so much background history on every aspect via the civilopedia the dlc adds on amongst other things quests which add to the story but in truth these add little to the game the narrative is really what you make it the interaction between the leaders of the other civilisations all struggling for power the alliances and conflicts mean there is very rarely a time of true peace or a dull moment replayability 10 fully customisable random maps different scenarios different civilisations and leaders make your own maps and scenarios full integrated into steam workshop with hundreds of brilliant mods it all adds up to a different experience each time and near infinite replayability multiplayer 6 this is not an easy game to play multiplayer the nature of the game means that you will all need a large amount of time to play a game through to completion which may be problematic especially with friends in different timezones or for people with connection issues the most enjoyable aspect of multiplayer i found was the hotseat mode in this mode you play locally and multiple players take the game in turns like a boardgame once again the time required to get near the end means you could be in for a very long but very enjoyable game overall 9 while some purists will prefer the earlier civ games in the series i feel that civ 5 and especially with the main dlcs is a worthy successor it has the right level of difficulty and depth much improved visuals and solid gameplay which will make you wonder where the hours went more reviews by fancy fish agree  disagree please leave me a comment

faultys scorecard  1 essential purchase 2 recommended purchase 3 recommended purchase during a sale 4 not recommended unless heavily discounted 5 not even recommended for steam game collectors king for a day a week a month a year an era the last civilization game i played was civilization iii and whilst i can no longer really remember the finer details of the game outside what is the core civilization experience i have very fond memories of it having only had one pc in the family home at the time it was a constant tussle of bribes threats and outright clashes with my younger brother as to who was going to get the chance to play as any good civ playing person would know is not a quick fix kind of game hours would mysteriously vanish right before ones very own eyes so a battle lost here was a sore defeat for that day i missed civ iv having taken a long break from gaming habouring the notion in my head that i had somehow outgrown playing computer games truth be told it was more along the lines of not really being able to afford a decent pc at the time hey i had just started working and i needed to eat and pay rent i do know however that there is an ardent civ iv fanbase that proclaim iv is still the master game but i am not going to get into that debate since i have no point of reference having never actually played it httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid215698176 so how does civilization v compare to its much older sibling as far as my tastes and expectations for a game of this nature go  it surpasses them civilization v sees you guide a prehistoric civilization at the very dawn of man through to the modern era using war diplomacy culture tourism and various technologies as they become available for your civilization to use these are selected from skills trees that offers a variety of gameplay styles early on in the game depending on how you level your civilization you will have access to a wealth of information regarding your progress such as diplomacy and espionage through to trade routes and city production output just to name a very few it can sometimes be a little overwhelming to the new comer as you try to grasp all the various little bits of information that enable a safe and successful passage through time for your chosen civilization the game does include a tutorial in the beginning but it really is up to the player to decide what to do with the wealth of information he or she is presented with dont despair though  you do quickly get a hang of things and besides mistakes made are valuable lessons learnt for future civilizations you can learn at a quicker rate by diving into a multiplayer session but expect to get your  handed to you since there are a great number of very good players out there but its a really good way to learn for the uninitiated i suggest working from the easiest difficulty setting upwards to the more advanced in your attempts to become a better player and master the games intricacies whilst it would be easy to praise everything from the production values to the graphics engine which supports directx ii to the soundtrack  we have come along in leaps and bounds since 2001  what really makes the difference is the move to a hexagonal tile over the square tiles previously employed on the grid this is a smart move and i am surprised to see it only show up in the games fifth iteration it certainly goes well with the renewed combat system which no longer allows you to stack your armies on one single tile like you previously could i also liked that they have now included the ability for a city to defend itself by simply firing onto an enemy within the correct tile radius this means that your armies no longer have to babysit your cities and capital and can now actually get out onto the frontlines of the war effort should you find yourself at war with one or more other civilizations although it would still be a wise decision to keep some of your stronger units around your capital city httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid215698622 the game also introduces city states which are computer controlled nonplayable cities that one can trade with or conquer depending on your proclivity there is also an option to use diplomacy however in the base game this was a mighty gold coin sink since these city states at time of release where so fickle and demanding they could plunge you into bankruptcy before you knew what was actually happening and ruin a playthrough thankfully this problem has been addressed in the subsequent standalone expansion packs gods and kings and a brave new world speaking of the expansion packs they really are essential purchases ensuring that you are getting the maximum civilization v experience not that the base game lacks anything at all that would make it feel incomplete  these expansions add new features such as religion and espionage as well as international trade routes and ability to form a world congress in the modern age i particularly like the inclusion of the world congress when formed sees all leaders of the civilizations in game meeting to push through global proposals the game becomes very much less predictable with this inclusion and much more exciting because there are now ten times more points of conflict that can arise want to place a heavy tax on militaristic civilizations crippling them from an upkeep perspective or see more of the arts flourish amongst all civilizations there are a host of options that arise here that can drastically alter the end game tourism and great works by various artists are also introduced which opens up the game in exciting and wonderful new ways httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid215596438 there is also a very vibrant modding community with civilization v having benefited from the steam workshop inclusion there is more than enough content available through this medium and the games official expansion packs and dlc which should see civilization v reign comfortably for quite some time into the foreseeable future if you enjoy grand strategy games i wouldnt hesitate advising you pick up civilization v if price is an issue  i have noted that the game repeatedly goes on a big dip sale when the steam holiday sales roll around so i would strongly urge you to pick it up then if you havent already civilization v is a time sink of a game so dont be surprised to see yourself sitting in front of your computer all red and blurryeyed as you watch the sun peak in the early morning sky civilization v is still one of my absolute favorite games in my games library and something i constantly keep installed firaxes have done an amazing job with this title and i heartily recommend it to any gamer with not only a passing interest in history or strategy but for anyone looking for quality and fun in equal measures if you

if youre new to civlization this is where to start everything is simplified for the better even if youre new to stradegy it has a lot of difficulty settings this is one of the best most complete stradegy games once you buy its 2 expansion packs gods & kings  brave new world not needed but recommended there are 5 different types of victory they are cultural domination space misson 2055 and diplomatic they are all fun to go for this is a stragey with some thinking involved and a lot of mapgame options and great mods are on the workshop so you could end up with hundreds and hundreds of hours eventually withnout noticing basically you start in anicents times and settle your first city with nothing you have to then guide your cilization to stand `the test of time` right through to da future only one civilization can be victorious so aim for victory ahead of everyone else there is multiplayer but i prefer not to stick to that due to people not finishing games a standared game can last litterly a full day recommended to anyone who hasnt played civlization

the first time i tried civ at a friends place the smooth start followed by a rush of adrenaline and a wave of pleasant warmth washing over my body the mouse trembles between my fingers and drops to the floor with a tink rolling away from my feet as my eyes pull back into my head thoughts bounce around the inside of my skull at a madmans pace you alright man i hear somebody whispering behind me they might as well be worlds away for just an hour or two i was god and just like that a cold snap of clarity whips across my consciousness and brings me back to the world of the living my vision has not yet adjusted to the darkness of the room a feeling of emptiness swallows me whole ii want more laughter echoes off the grimy stucco walls youll get another wait your turn friend i am standing opening the door walking out of the room but my body remains in that chair a shell of myself will always be in that chair as i passed through the doorway and was assaulted by the bright light of an austrian afternoon my friends greeted a ghost and escorted him to their car how was it man is it is crazy as they say are you going to try it again youre wild dude i just stare off into the distance and think about the sound that mouse made when it hit the ground tink i wish i could go back there and pick it up civ not even once
recommended
this game is one of a kind well along with civilizations 1 ii iii and iv if you enjoyed other civilizations games its highly likely you will enjoy this one as well there are a few things that are notably different from other versions of civilizations the most obvious is the units per tile restrictions in civ 5 there is only allowed 1 unit type per tile meaning only 1 combat unit can be on any tile in some ways its better in some its worse but it does lend itself to strategy of positioning of your army being much more important than in earlier versions another is that cities when attacked take damage themselves instead of any unit defending i believe its related to the 1 unit type per tile because it would be odd if you only had to kill one unit to take a city these two differences from earlier versions does give the game a different feel from earlier versions but it does still feel much more similar to civilizations than it does to a game like colonizationciv4col although not that it would be a bad thing if it was similar to colonization another great sid meier game overall i highly recommend it to anyone considering just make sure you have time to play because you will be hooked
recommended
what else to say than just one more turn the legendary seriesfranchisetimeconsumingvoid that is civilization continues to conquer the hearts of all us wouldbe world leaders who lacks the ambition and are too lazy to strive for power outside of the digital realm to ascertain whether or not to play civilization there is really only one question you need ask yourself how many days off can i afford before getting fired if the answer is below five you should probably leave now im serious leave anyhow if you have never before played civilization you owe it to yourself to try it you will not regret it except for when you get fired of course it is simply aweinspiringly brilliant an epic journey through history rewriting history

so finally nearly 600 hours in civi v and finally i believe i can give it a fair review so lets get the obv out of the way is civi v good  yes otherwise i wouldnt have spent 600 hours in it and still booting it up now and then civi v lacks nothing on graphics or gameplay it is top of the line and there it is 100s of mods for those who wishes to change their gameplay in anyway possible civi v is not as detailed or brutally hard as the former games in this installment however that is a great thing in my eyes as it gets a lot of new players to test out the series that the rest of us have enjoyed for so many years the dlc`s gods & kings and brave new world adds a lot of the things we are use to from ealier series and is diffenetly worth getting for anyone who likes the more complex version of the civi series that beeing said the other dlc`s is mainly just new maps or new nations to play with and really only something you should pickup if you are a huge fan or on sale so civi is as it always have been you start with a settler and one more unit and here you go form a nation that will stand the test of time there is multiple ways to achive victory and it is important that you play to your nations strenghts and use your enemies weaknesses through the different time periods of our planet this is classic civi after all tho do not let it fool you civi is a game that takes a long time often 6 hours pr map and often one nation is just gonna hate you more than anyone else in my case it was poland wich wanted to nuke and kill me no matter what they did a good job sometimes too all in all a great game and a great installment of the civi series that brings a lot of new players and a lot of life into the series so if you like complex games that takes time and patience then make sure you pick it up
recommended
too bad im not completely fluent in any other languages yet because english certainly doesnt have the words to describe how epic this game is im currently playing my bazillionth game and ive played nearly 750 hours but every game still feels like a brand new experience the ui is probably the most userfriendly in any game ever and the music is just plain awesome plus every game is randomly generated theres a demo download it and youll see what i mean so when you do get hooked and you do dish out 80 bucks for the gold edition plus brave new world as you should dont get upset when you start failing your classes or missing work because you played all night and didnt even notice because trust me your time is better spent here

fireaxis has managed to pull off a fantastic game here  civilization v has a very indepth play system that is easy to understand for beginners and yet complex enough to keep even the most advanced user thinking the turnbased system is quite fair though a little bit does rely on luck if youre playing multiplayer who gets to host is 1st player and thus gets priority on wonders so if both you and player 1 have 1 turn left on the great library player 1 will get it first but i personally play a lot of singleplayer the bot difficulty level increases at a high rate as you go up  1 is basically playing against yourself 2 may be challenging for someone learning the game 3 is an ok difficulty though still a bit easy 4 is the equivalent of a moderately skilled human player and 5 has the tactic of a skilled player plus extra sciencefoodproduction so i personally play on level 4 i wont go into details about levels 68 because ive never tried them nor do i plan to in the near future the ui is quite userfriendly  if there is an action that needs to be done it will show up in the lowerright corner just above the minimap there are 4 advisors that help new players understand what to build and how it will benefit them as well as whether or not to attack an enemy unit and even who you may stand a chance against in a total war spies also add a new level of strategy to the game as you must decide whether you will try to steal technology from other people or if you will protect your own technology then you add spy promotions in which recruits will almost always be beaten by agents who will almost always be beaten by special agents by changing spies around that have different promotions you can achieve a different level of defense and offense in espionage for example if you want to steal from a country that has lots of tech but you just want intrigue about another nation that has little tech you can send your special agent over to the country that has lots of tech and your recruit to the other nation overall this is a really fun game the only drawback is its price but if it ever goes on sale it is definitely worth picking up if youre into strategy games

id appreciate it if you checked out my blog where i do reviews giveaways and more httpsgandhigamingwordpresscom note this review includes the brave new world addon it makes the game alot better trust me alexander the great greece reviews the components needed to make the spaceship he notices that he needs the engine but doesnt have the proper technology to obtain this piece for a scientific victory angered at this he asks his remaining friends for some research agreements to get the tech he needs to win he gets two from his friends ramkhamhaeng did i spell that right anyway siam and also pedro ii brazil but it wouldnt go into effect for about 30 turns alex just groans and begins to switch up his productions and his science so he can aim toward getting that engine oda nobunaga japan then begins to take down ramesses iis egypt last city which was his capital siam gets angered by seeing that oda is taking down all of their allies and attempts to charge at him japan was able to sweep his army and destroyed all of his cities with his deadly ability where wounded units still fight at full strength pedro ii sends a spy to odas capital to see where he will strike next him or alex alex and pedro set up some defenses and attempt to build a wall to defend themself from this unstoppable force oda decides to hit pedro first and slowly takes down all of his cities one by one and took down rio de janeiro the greek forces began to hold the enemy marines and paratroopers off after a successful ambush by an xcom unit alexander had some time to finish up the engine technology the next turn sparta and all of the other cities besides athens were destroyed by odas unstoppable force however right when oda was about to charge in and destroy greece both research agreements were used and got the technology needed alex quickly moved all his units away from athens and used his remaining gold to purchase the engine it was pricey but he was able to attach it to the spaceship japanese units were closing in fast and the greek soldiers started dying quickly but right when the artillery was about to fire they all see the glorius sight of a spaceship flying in the sky and going to space oda looks at the spaceship and starts yelling in defeat knowing that he lost to greece with a scientific victory right when they were about to get a domination victory in civilization v or civ those events are actually pretty common it takes a little while to get used to but once you get into it it becomes very addictive to the point you havent slept in days yep days my head is pretty rotten right now from playing this but god you need this game if you got to purchase any game on steam for free make it this just buy it you will love it and i guarantee it even if the ai can be annoying but yeah just friggin buy it why are you still reading this why havent bought this game yet gandhi is going to nuke you so hard he could just whack hello gandhi here you better buy this game or else im willing to nuke you and your cities and your family and your friends and everyone you know and just about everyone else on this planet 1110

ive done the 1000 hour mark today it is time for a review now this game is just fantastic the game is easy to learn but in the end it will surprise you with its complexity i must not only pay attention to how i set up my cities before the war begins to rare luxury resources i have to take care of my religion and culture while wonders of the world built and new technologies are explored incidentally my population is dissatisfied and my neighbor is spying me in the end its time for the atomic bomb in addition there are numerous scenarios each with their own requirements in short with my previous 1000 hours play time im not done yet please dont forget to rate my review if it was helpful  edit may15 i am playing with mods from steamworkshop now and  i am suprised i am using circa 100 mods which add new wonders new units new buildings new resources new religions and reliefs and new techs sometimes i dont want to play this game but its too much fun i really like it  i think i will hit the 1500 hours mark soon

arguably the best strategy game to ever come to steam due to the amount of content and endless replay value  in the verge of winning cultural victory until gandhi napoleon and alexander the great declared war against me in the last minute got angry and ended up wiping out the entire planet with nuclear weapons and unintentionally dominated the world with military might dont fck with me 1010  you may encounter genghis khan during your civilization experience and hell be your best friend even if your civilization doesnt have the great military strength also has a cool personality and usually got your back in the midst of trouble bestfriends4life 9510  want to do a historical reenactment with your selected civilizations go ahead it may be historically inaccurate but you ended up enjoying a lot more than you originally intended 910  dont have any allies with other civilizations you can gift a unit or send gold to citystates to become your friends and allies at least youre not lonely in a hostile world where everyone can backstab you like a sneaky btch im looking at you gandhi hey its a good thing when citystates will fight and die for you 8510 theres something wrong when you have the freedom ideology and ended up dominating most of the planet by the information era 8510  in the middle of war you would most likely hear depressing orchestral soundtrackand ended up making peace with your enemies not because that you lost interest in war or you feel bad for wiping out enemy units and annexing cities its because the soundtrack will make your heart cry 1010  the best political simulator ever 1010 with endless replay value and unlimited ways to deal with your friends and foes in a hostile world civilization is still considered as the gamers cocaine from many owners who own the franchise still dont have the game go get civilization v or genghis khan and i will declare war against you

pros one of the most amazing strategies games ever cons gandhi gandhi gandhi gandhi and you guessed it no unit stacking all in all this game is pretty good i do reccomend turning off gandhi because i dont think he had studied the cold war because he obviously doesnt know the consequences of nuclear warfare
recommended
civilization v is a great game whenever i play it i cant seem to stop there is that just one more turn thinking that keeps me playing turn after turn
recommended
hands down the greatest turnbased strategy they have upgraded all the best parts of civ iv and fixed most of the glaring problems with continued expansion support the game consistently gets better with each release
recommended
an absolute timesucking game that will draw you in with its siren song of just one more turn before you know it society has collapsed around you and the only thing prying you away from the computer is a lack of power and doritos

amazing strategy game civilization is one of the best games ive ever played if i want to go casual or have a little thinking from trade routes to the welfare of your people from allies with other civilization to building a utopia and from building an army to starting wars wait those start tears you play as a random leader or pick a leader with various units and skills and you try to build the perfect civilization or beat the other players other civilization in a war until you are the last one alive you have to worry about gold income happiness of your people and the welfare for the population to go up and a growing civilization what i really like is the personality of each of the ai playes if you play solo i think it can happen in multiplayer too as for the victory so far you have to build a utopia adopt 5 full policy or be the last civilization and that means you guessed it war it is also a game of trust if a civilization likes you or not or a player decides interesting facts george washington adopted communist in the year of 1400 ad napoleon bonaparte was a huge ahole around other civilizations and declares war after being on their good side askia mohammad is friendly even if he is carrying a sword and has a burning kingdom behind him mohandas gandhi has disposable nukes in his closet sources this game

this game is far too amazing for words start as ethopia thinking of a small peaceful playthrough as i dont get new cities well 50 turns later annex a city state for taking my horse tile greece tells me to stop expanding near him greece tells me the whole world thinks my army is a joke annex athens and raze his other level 1 settlement annex another city state with an extra settlement what started as aiming for a small civ ends up in 4 settlements starts war on rome annex two of his settlements make peace ghandi becomes world congress host with 13 delegates cry in corner 1110 just one more turn

civ 5 is a game where you are the leader of a civilization obviously you can destroy your foes in a domination victory with your army you can use education and science to win in a science victory or maybe try for a different victory whether your more of a warmongering player or a peaceful player civ 5 is a great game to play with friends family or maybe just randoms you can make allies enemies or maybe just friends that may or may not backstab you with other civilizations you can explore the world and settle more cities to expand your civilization more research technologies to unlock more features make money by trading luxury resources and other stuff and make wonders that will help your civilization in different ways the game is also newbfriendly as the guiders will help you grow your civilization through your first and upcoming journies if youve played the previous civs youre probably going to like civ 5 the dlc brave new world makes civ 5 a whole lot better such as it completely changes culture victories which makes it more interesting and fun overall to acomplish a culture victory it adds more civilizations and wonders and changes the way you make money by actually making you make trade routes with other civilizations or citystates to make money however the vanilla game without dlc is still pretty good i personally believe the game and dlc is worth the money overall i rate this game 1010

wtf is wrong with this game i even forgot that real life exists this is worse than hardcore drugs

perfect thing to waste whole your life

i hate this game
recommended
this is the first turnbased strategy game ive ever played so be aware that this review does not come from a connoisseur at first the game can be very intimidating you have no real idea what to do and you just go with the flow you soon realize the mistake youve done as you get crushed by your opponents after a couple of games versus the ai you start the comprehend the way you should go about playing and the game starts shining its very fun to play alone ive personally never played against another person and theres no timer or anything forcing you to rush and make irrational decisions so its very relaxing theres a lot of different countries you can play as each one having different traits to bring to the table making it refreshing to play over and over to try different play styles believe me you might say  just one more turn  but we all know youre lying to yourself

i spent 28 hours over four days building my empire i spent every minute i could infront of the screen expanding and fconquering trading and building researching and discussing with other civilizations every second i was away from the computer this game was on my mind when i closed my eyes i saw ghengis kahn fulfiling his destiny trying to rule the world i was fired from my job after attacking a customer that looked like ghandi screaming that he was the reason that my people were wearing blue jeans and listening to low quality music i was driving down to dinner with my girlfriend when we hit a rabbit she broke down crying hysterical and urged me to get out of the car and help the slain animal but all my mind could do is turn to her and say a single death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic after four days i wasnt sleeping only planning my next move my eyes were red my hair was falling out and i couldnt stomach solid foods only energy drinks i lost to washington of america who got a scientific victory when i was one move away from taking over his capital city now i have no job no friends no girlfriend and my family stopped talking to me all because of four days i owned this game all in all 1010 would suggest to friendssocoworkers if i had any

sid meiers civilization v sucks hour after hour of your day away giving rise to plans of global conquest and thoughtful tactics of course you could say the same of civ games of the past but what makes civilization v a praiseworthy successor is how it changes up key elements of the franchise the games core valuesexpansion exploitation exploration exterminationare as strong as ever but the newer tactical combat and addition of citystates give strategy veterans new ways of tackling their goals while a friendly interface and expansive civilopedia help newcomers get up to speed relatively quickly there are a few aspects of civilization v that could have used a bit more attention but even as is this is yet another classic edition to a series that consistently rewards and renovates if you have even the remotest interest in worldwide domination you owe it to yourself to get lost in one of the most rewarding turnbased games in years advantages  hours of addictive turnbased glee  fantastic new tactical combat system  excellent interface makes it easy to keep track of every aspect of the game  great automation features allow you to focus on the big picture  lovely visuals and classical soundtrack disadvantages  inconsistent overly aggressive ai  scattered annoyances particularly in multiplayer

civilization v is one of the most interesting strategy games ive ever seen this game gives you absolute freedom you can build anything you want you can conquer any country you want you can buy everything and everybody yeah you want you can explore new territories you can create your own great empire dont know how to start your councillors will give you some advice dont want to play it only by yourself you can take your friends to play with you moreover everything is accompanied by various sounds figures are not static and what i found really good is that you dont have to do boring quests likebuild 10 factories and 5 farms because you decide what to do by yourself i think that everyone who like strategy games should try this one it worth every penny btw it isnt expensive at all
recommended
i hope you have nothing to do tomorrow morning

ok where should i start how im in love with history of humankind or how sid meier made a deity of historybased sandbox games nope there are too little space for that do we need some comparisons like with paradox games or total war series nah they are distinct too many details too narrative those games are awesome no doubt but not in an aerial way like civilization does main catch of this game is in its simplicity everybody can rule an empire there though its a sandbox it has a different face for every player you want to rage a war and hold the whole world under your color  do that or you want to be in peace with everybody oh you can do that too in dozens of variants dozens i mean thousands the devil is in the details you know civilization v  is a peak of long lasting walk i liked first and second games especially second those fundamentalists are gorgeous im still prefering third civilization when im going for domination victory fourth game feels like win vista to me overall fifth civ game  the most complex and balanced of all cultural achievments market deals political unions and religion issue  all are far better than before if i was supposed to play in one game for life there are good chances that id picked that one one thing i have to add  no matter what strategy you want to use make a louvre and hermitage full of stuff build a spaceship or run the league of nations  you want an army your army every strong player could tell you that history tells you that today news like ukranian story telling you the very same if you dont feed own army soon youre gonna be feeding somebody else si vis pacem para bellum peace people make love not war mark 1010 of course

strategically planning out what to research produce where to attack or settle in you pick the pace map civilization and everything multiplayer can be really fun but if you invade a friend theyll be  off for a while also i would reccomend getting all the dlc with the game once you play with the dlc the default looks way too plain press next turn already every friend ever

one day while i was walking down a serene path i encountered a grave evil that i myself could not have possibly defeated alone there they were the great khan and the great ghandi marching side by side down a path towards my empire i the great paccal of course could not let this great transgression aside so i talked to my great correspondent frezdful calfrul and asked him for holy advice he by smoking a green plant and drinking the blood of sheep had great premonitions and then told me only by sacrificing my relatives that i could defeat the great evil headed towards my empire my unbreakable belief in my correspondent lead me to an awakened power deep within the bottom half of my body and there i was flaying my relatives and sacrificing them towards the great sun king this of course manifested a great power within myself i became ferrocia the great lizard king i uttered a few words feerotoa aoiasjiogjoiasj and by doing those measly acts i increased my kingdoms science output to >9000 and construction to >9000 and built many troops over my 5 city large empire truly it was something to behold  as i built an army of xcom and death robots to shatter the power my opponents held they were at my mercy and that is the story of me the great gozz

civilization v is a fantastic turnbased strategy ive personally have been a fan of the series for a long time and this is by far the best one there is many different modes to play and multiple ways to win and no two games are ever alike there is also a ton of mods for this game so check out the workshop you will easily lose hours to this game and i cant keep track of how many times i say just one more turn and never realize how late it is until after the fact if you dont own this game already you are seriously missing out

civilization the bread and butter of turnbased strategy games the absolute pinnacle of eyeneedling backbreaking thousand upon thousand of turns over the course of what i think are the longest games youll ever play the only game thats longer than a civ marathon game is life itself as a huge pirate player of civ4  expansions i must say i am pleasently surprised with civ5 i though it was lacking the depth the fourth had but in reality its just overall better everything probably due to the fact that death stacks are no longer in the game  910 strategy  if youre a fan of anything that involves tactics macromanaging resourcemanagement general strategy youll feel at home in this game everything is so smooth and straightforward youll be dying to pass the test of time and try your best to emerge victorious as the greatest civilization skill roof is damn high and its one of those games thats hard to master definitely a collosus of the strategy community cons ai in the game is barely pottytrained it just follows a given route most of the time and its painstakingly predictable once you played a lot  810 multiplayer  awarded a 75 because multiplayer as a concept for this gameis impossible without dedication and a group of friends to meetup around the clock at various points during a week to pick up on the last save its hard to set up but boy its so much fun really worth going for multi singleplayer rocks a lot if you dont manage to find friends cons time consuming difficult to maintain a game or find people who will  1010 game mechanics  combat and tactics are just so satisfying compared to old civ games tech advances are meaningful territorial management makes you feel like you own your civilization balance is properly set with the exception of the spawn roulette that will obviously give random locations with random benefits and resources maps are great modding community went to space and theres a lot to be imported from their work learning curve can go through your regular linear graphs everything is intuitive and easy to learn one game that has a whole lot of depth cons havent found any negatives on the game mechanic side  910 ui and graphic style  everything is smooth as butter the devteam have done a great job with this game and everything is polished graphic style fits beautifully with the nature of the game and it doesnt distract you from the important part the game itself cons i would love to have more data and info instead of this minimalism but thats just me  dlcs arent that great the only real advantage for me would be the modding community that usually moves fast towards modding the expansions cons dlcexpansions they cost money and divide the community  big fan of this game and the series few games have managed to make me wish for one more turn until the sun rose the second day and my clock showed me 7 am and this is one of those games the great heir to the previous stellar game and i recommend it to anyone with any of the following  time on his hands  great love for strategy  great love for turnbased games  some playful love of history  friends you can play with  money to spare check discounts if possible     9  10

updated 2014 originally i said in my review in 2011 pretty good but lacking a lot of features from civ iv reminds me more of a remake of civ ii at its core still as super addictive as the rest of the franchise with a few new twists lots of dlcs to waste your money on too fast forward to 2014 with more than a few hundred hours played under my belt the game is officially complete with multiple small dlcs & balancefix patches plus the 2012 & 2013 feature expansions in gods & kings and brave new world which have significantly changed the gameplay there are now a massive number of civilizations to choose too not to mention a massive number of tailored scenarios to challenge you the major expansions particularly have really rounded the game off nicely reintroducing many of the earlier missed features from civ iv introduced more new things like world congress advanced trade routes tourism & cultural great works to complement previously missing features like religion & espionage along with this content there was also balancing out all civilization victory paths providing some unique gameplay options to explore there remains a more simplified approach to all of this streamlining many features meaning less micro management this does make the game more accessible to newer players but in some ways feels perhaps too simplified now it would have been good to still have more advanced micro management for those that are up to the challenge although more simplified game design you will find more things to keep you busy more end game content for example to cover those dull periods where things become stagnent then there is off course the huge number of achievements to unlock many of which offer a true challenge and sometimes a bit of luck overall even 4 years on from my first game it is a game i always end up going back to that is rare in the current generation of disposable gaming it is the most enjoyable & rewarding strategy game around bar none just one more turn

civilization v is one of the best turnbased strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player this is one game that any strategy enthusiast or hell anyone stratcurious should check out sure i miss some of the deeper intercivilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in civilization iv but thats nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about with all the tips advisers and tools in place this is the first civilization for pc that i feel is worth just about every persons time go forth and create subdue and exploit do as firaxis has done and bring civilization to the masses

one of the best turnbased strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing 2k games have outdone themselves in making some massive changes without changing the core gameplay and alienating their fansimprovements to the user interface and ai at all levels result in it being more approachable for newcomers without losing any of the strategic depth that longtime fans crave it vastly improves combat making the microlevel gameplay both more complex and entertaining it trims all the fat leaving only decisionmaking strategic planning and the sheer joy of crushing your enemies civ v is the pinnacle of the franchise to dateas a hardcore strategy gamer who is no stranger to planning out my empires production dozens of turns in advance ive already turned to civ v for my worldconquering needs  but at the same time if anything is going to rear a new generation of strategy gamers like the very first civilization did for me its thiscivilization v is a fantastic entry in the series which avoids the trap of getting stagnant thanks to some important novelties on combat system interface and general design designed to create a 4x of elegant and clean mechanics

dwarved by the expectations of featurehungry fans and a remarkably successful history the civilization series is one of the last bastions of traditional turnbased 4x strategy games perhaps acting as the sole major life support for an increasingly whittling genre in retrospect it is a game that initially failed on many fronts upon launch it was rightly heavily criticised for underperforming in many aspects that civ 4 had proudly refined  trading religion and diplomacy amongst others however with the addition of both expansions brave new world and gods and kings civ 5 recovered most of the features it had lost or underdelivered on regardless issues regarding bugs illogical ai poor performance online connectivity issues and abusively priced dlc remain open wounds to this very day firaxis has now had 4 years to deal with at least some of the games remaining problems but have instead neglected them preferring to focus on civilization beyond earth overlooking the aforementioned issues however will reveal a deep rewarding well paced game in which planning ahead is rewarded with the chance to steamroll enemy civilisations victories can be achieved either using culture tourism science military force or diplomacy laying the groundwork for daylong matches that can twist and turn whilst simultaneously providing endless intrigue machiavellian scheming and gargantuan military campaigns rushing to build the next world wonder is often equally as thrilling as pillaging a hostile citys tiles whilst trading with allied civilisations for emergency gold supplies in order to purchase those last few bombers needed to take the heavily fortified city should you prefer to take a more littlefingeresque approach spies can steal technology manipulate voting and even provide political intrigue and military intelligence embargoes can cripple tradebased economies even international congress votes can be traded for luxuries resoruces and cities allegiances are frequently earned and lost ensuring the game is never predictable and with the seemingly endless policies technologies units and ways to turn your initial settlers into a sprawling international empire civilisation 5 provides plenty of replayability to be a staple of your gaming time for years just bare in mind that if you want to get the most out of the game you will absolutely have to read its builtin wiki to make up for the needlessley steep learning curve and often infuriating lack of vital information

if you dont like going outside you dislike having friends and want to either be nuked by ghandi and his legion of death robots or conquer the world as ghandi this is the game for you if you want to rewrite history and lead atilla and his huns to religious dominance by founding christianity as a peaceloving people this is the game for you if you want to find out what itd be like if a civilization had discovered how to make rifles and tanks while everyone else on the planet is still waving pointy metal sticks at each other this is the game for you if none of these things apply to you youre probably dead inside and even then this is still the game for you

when i was a young lad attending school a friend of mine approached me he said hey do you play civilization v feeling insulted by the lower life form i took a  on his chest and began repeatedly punching him in the throat as i did this i came to the realization that i did not in fact play civilization v seeking to correct this miscalculation i walked to my house and purchased the game after playing a few matches i knew i was destined to be the civilization v champion what does this story mean you ask well it means that you may look at the screenshots of this game and see some worthless crap but if you purchase it youll realize the true meaning of friendship that  isnt meant to be plopped on someones chest but rather in a toilet so stop  on that gentlemens torso put that  where it belongs and purchase civilization v its a pretty good game

let me tell you a story of love loss and nuclear weaponry i was young the leader of the roman empire this empire stretched from jerusalem past germany and all the way down to cape town  i had constructed the great wall and i had over 30 ground units and 50 naval units needless to say i was the most powerful player in the game while exploring the rest of the earth however i met catherine the great the leader of the russian people she was the most beautiful person i ever laid my eyes upon sadly i couldnt understand her because she was well russian but i loved her and i was determined to make this work however she got angry at me because i was too clingy so i nuked her entire empire my dreams of a happy life had been lost and i agustus caeser was angry with the world soon i went on a rampage killing every unit bombing every city and conquering every empire then my computer crashed i forgot to save i realized that i had been playing for forty five hours and it was all for nothing within those forty five hours i forgot to feed my dog my mother who was in the hospital died i missed the job interview for a job that would pay me $500000 a year something flew through my window and layed eggs in my freezer my house payment was due and i skipped it but then i realized doesnt sid meiers civilization 5 have an auto save feature and it turns out it auto saved right before my computer crashed i went on about killing everyone happily ever after 1010 like this if you cry everytime

sid meier really is a crazy guy he divided the world into hexagons to make this hexagon warfare simulator peter molyneux mustve rolled in his grave when he saw this anyway this is civilization v which is a game where you have a city and then it expands and you steamroll other cities its more of a colonialism game but then only people who look back on colonialism fondly use the word civilization what bugs me here is that indias leader is gandhi so when i built loads of trebuchets and annexed paris my brain literally exploded into tiny pieces because i couldnt comprehend it either way gandhis likeness is pretty well imagined here much better than ben kingsleys weirdly long head good hexagonal tessellation game

this review is written from the perspective of someone playing with all dlc take control of one of the most successful nations in history as their most successful leader and lead your people to become the greatest nation the world has ever seen civ 5 is one of the most popular and well known turnbased strategy games available on steam and its there for a reason with an unrivalled techtree attention to detail and variety this game has something for all strategy fans beautiful looking game complex tech tree challenging ai multiple paths to victory large variety of maps and game options youll never play the same game twice numerous nations to choose from great modding community especially for new maps great fun with friends but only at a similar skill level easy to learn hard to master a full match on normal difficulty takes upwards of five hours some nations are clearly more powerful than others it takes an incredibly long time to process computer turns when playing against a large number of nations in later stages of the game enemy nations can very quickly overwhelm others and gain large amounts of land the ai always have double standards especially when it comes to expanding borders on spying on one another verdict 9 an absolute must play for strategy fans el k

definitely the most engaging strategy game i have ever played but it is not for everyone to start off with the cons this game will take a couple hundred hours to learn to a decent level and if you are considering buying it do yourself a favor and buy at least the brave new world dlc with it or you will be missing about half of the game and will have to deal with an unnacceptably broken combat system also the multiplayer servers are extremely unreliable it is very difficult to play out a full game with random players if everyone in the game is your friend you can save the game regularly and reinvite everyone when it crashes unlike most strategy games civilization v is much more than simply military confrontationcombat every player leads one of histories civilizations from the start of time when military combat is limited to club warriors and ancient archers and your empire consists of a single small undeveloped town until the information era by which time the players in the lead would have nuclear weaponry modern armor helicopter gunships internet and stealth fighters and your civilization could have over a dozen cities each up to 50 times larger than your original village the success of your civilization depends not only on your battlefield prowess although it is a necessary component but in your ability to build your civilizations economy science and culture faster than your neighboring civilizations and in keeping your civilizations population happy a serious setback in any of these parameters will affect all of them and will allow other civilizations in the game to bypass you and eventually either destroy you or win peacefull through science culture or diplomacy a major positive about the game especially in singleplayer is the diversity of the strategies you can use with each particular civilzation usually suited only to one or two win conditions

civilization a series of computer games as synonymous with turnbased strategy as the old tabletop board game risk i got to play the original civilization in its hayday on an old ibm using dos to fire it up in wonder the following seven nights were spent doing nothing but playing civ and civilization 5 embodies nearly all of the same traits and innovations that made the original so great ive spent a couple hundred hours last year in civ5 with gods & kings and loved every minute i recently purchased the newest expansion but havent completely explored the additional gamemechanics much since even after this long im still trying to master to base games mechanics and the religion that gods and kings introduced but overall civ5 is the turnbased strategy game to currently end all turnbased strategy games if youve never played a civilization game before thats just fine civ5 can be a perfect introduction to turnbased strategy or if youve played all the previous games nearly to death like i have this game will completely kickdown the door to almost everything you wanted from the other games the hexagon tiles took a little bit of getting used to for me but since its something i remember from the first big tabletop games i ever played i dont mind it at all and think it adds a bit of an old school feeling to the board there are a few hangups in the animations  unit movements aircraft orders need an overhaul because they drastically tie up your time in late game in comparison to any other unit but other than that graphically civ5 is beautiful and the board features and resources are about as detailed and distinct as your computer can handle the sound and music is immersive and high quality as you might expect from an alist sid meier game the interface and controls are almost perfect in my opinion a couple datacharts are a little bit buried down through the menus but i cant really complain about that since even buried down in the menus at worst only means 2 or 3 layers into readily accessible options anyway so nothing is very far away testament to the games refined user interface i think would be the fact that many gamers have easily played civ5 with a consolegaming style controller with the upcoming steambox livingroom pc and thats definitely saying something substantial when talking about as complex a turnbased strategy game as civ5 ultimately id say this would go on my top 10 of all time definitely worth purchasing and supporting the developers who brought it to us

between the original version the gods and kings expansion and now brave new world ive accumulated 500 hours of gameplay and it doesnt look like thats stopping any time soon by itself civ v is one of the best strategy games ive ever played with the right mods of which there are plenty it becomes truly addictive generally one of my biggest gripes with empirebuilding games is that your empire supports your military conquests in civ your military supports your empire i have maybe one game in ten where ill initiate a war most of the time im way too busy creating the most dominant empire in the land and it varies every time right now im pushing a game where my religion covered half the globe the game before that my scientific accomplishments were second to none every game is different if you play the same way every time youre not going to get far i cant emphasize enough how important it is to get both expansion packs gods and kings was praised for adding the religion mechanic but its primary benefit is a major revamp of the combat system and technology tree that makes both of them so much more neat and logical brave new world drastically alters both the culture and the diplomacy victories and both are for the better forcing you to put effort into those victories through the whole game and get mods i cant tell you which ones to get but absolutely get some as you play the game youll start to notice little things you wish it did differently and 90% of the time someones already made a mod to fix that im playing with over a dozen right now some make wonders more usable some add more luxury resources or religions one of them makes scouts usable past the medieval era and another removes the cap on xp you can get from barbarians and a whole mess more ive actually reached a point where im mixing and matching my mods based on what type of game im trying to run this game will very likely become my 1 most played game and pretty much the only thing thats going to stop me from accumulating 1000 hours in it is life put this game on your wishlist pick up the expansion packs during steam sales and get addicted

fantastic turnbased rpg this game gets a ton of flak from traditional civ fans but the new interface creates a fresh new experience that you are just as likely to unwittingly spend hours playing modding community is terrific and adds hundreds if not thousands of hours to this already immense game though i have 200 hours logged i have barely scratched the surface of content in this game

with many games more and more emphasizing adrenalinepumping action playing a slower paced strategy game like civilization can be refreshing indeed civilization v is the kind of game you can sit down popcorn and soda in hand and become completely engrossed in political crises border tensions and epic battles while it may not train your reflexes or aiming abilities youll certainly find yourself performing insane feats of balance as you try to maintain your civilizations military defense culture scientific advancement religious development and economic power youll find a game that is admittedly not immediately exciting but which will involve the player in incredibly complex situations never playing out the same way each time always offering a new story however there are some valid criticisms worth considering i will address two primary problems with the game that are connected to smaller issues others have brought up firstly much depth and complexity present in civilization iv has been stripped from the game and it shows in civilization iv leaders acted very often according to their historical personalities  gandhi would have an aversion to war wheras genghis khan might be attracted to the possibility  in civ v gandhi will happily crush your entire country to seize your spice resources the hostility and viciousness of the ai in civ v by contrast detracts from the games believability besides the hostility of the computer players they are also gloriously stupid they make insane trade offers demand whole cities in wartime when they are losing and capitulate in war when they have the advantage as deep and involving as the game is the ai manages to detract from the experience often enough to be worth mentioning the second criticism worth considering is that too often it breaks the spell of depth and plays more like a strategy game it is a strategy game yes but the game is also about civilization and how complex and wonderfully intertesting human society can be and sometimes the play to win mentality that is inherent in the game especially its ai as well as many of the players can weaken the games ability to absorb the player into the story of human civilization beyond these criticisms the game presents itself well the interface is much cleaner compared to previous iterations in the series and the warfare much more interesting in previous titles units could be stacked on top of one another so often the winning of wars came down to who had the most material power to build the biggest unit stacks as a result of the removal of unit stacking material power will help but an ability to position units correctly and actually strategize will win you the battle even in the event you are outnumbered thus civilization v may rightly boast of having the best combat and warfare the series has seen however shallow the game can be at its worst its intensely engaging and dramatic in the most positive sense at its best  every action that is simple or basic in one game is dramatically important in civilization for example moving units close to another civilizations borders somewhat tedious and uninteresting at face value raises the tension as you prepare for an epic war against their evil imperialistic civilization in the context of world civilizations all actions become pronounced and important  helping the game tell a story of warring global civilizations in crisis rather than simply telling the story of a competitive match between two players each trying to win that dramatic worldly context is what allows the game to tell such interesting new stories upon each playthrough and definitely what makes the game so incredibly addicting involving and engaging despite the admittedly valid criticisms i couldnt possibly recommend this game more

for fans of the strategy genre civ 5 can probably be regarded as the granddaddy of 4x pick a historical empire build your civilisation in anyway you want and win in a variety of ways from war to trade to culture and science civ 5 is slow paced at the start but is one of the most engaging strategies on the market with a simple interface meaning that you dont get bogged down by ugly text unlike many other strategies civ 5 seems simple  but is hard to master and if you get bored there are almost infinite number of user modifications available from the workshop

as an experienced civ series player civ v had a rough start initially and was inferior to the expanded version of civ iv however just as civ iv progressed so did civ v through the years this review reflects civ v with the 2 expansions gods and kings and brave new world once again we face the just one more turn syndrome that this game has always provided this 4x turnbased strategy game continues to evolve by enhancing the multiple victory conditions for the game many scenarios are available and the steam workshop for civ now creates easily assessible mods for the game to increase replayability the ai still makes strategic mistakes but evens out a bit at the higher difficulty levels due to ai bonusesplayer penalties the endgame has greatly improved over previous iterations of the series due to the enhancements to diplomatic and cultural victory conditions the replayability and replayability of civ v is so good that i will nitpick on a couple of areas for improvement and mods are out that resovle this too those improvement areas are to make the different cultures even more unique more unique looks between the cultures and speeding up the preformance on huge maps otherwise this civ v with the dlcs is an excellent game that will take up just one more turn

this game is a big bag of fun its basicly like a board game like chess or some other kind of board game civ 5 is a strategy game and one of the best in my opinion and is deffenetly worth a buy [ps sorry if i spelled something wrong p]

the first civ game ive played properly tried demos and such with the older ones always been into stragedy and epic scale empirewar games but always prefred the totalwar series as it had the turnbased empire building and the realtime battles i just assumed civ games would bore me or i would miss the real battles to much as like any of the big turn based games europauniversals crusaderkings etc the battles in civs are just on the campaign map and are the rockpaperscissor unit v unit fights always just imagined that as boring and would take away from the feeling of them being your units or being real flights i was hella wrong theres a really nice feel and charm to watching your units fight it out esp sending bombers to far away cities or maybe a nuke sending some crossbowman to rain arrows down on bandits or parachuting marines across islands and so on the fights just taking place on the campaign maps also lets the game be extremely well polished as its just one genrearea to work on unlike say the totalwars which are realtime and turnbased in one and leads to a jack of all trades but master of none as we all know how janky the tw series is well civ5 is the fecking master alright brilliant game and daftly addicting got it in crimbo sale and ive not played much else since buy it its in humblebundle right now for silly cheap price no excuses

there are three dominant reasons why i recommend this game 1 no micromanaging 50000000000 things per turn later in the game unlike other turnbased strategy games like rome total war ii a lot of game mechanics are autonomous making smooth turnbyturn play 2 nicola tesla is a great engineer in this game he has done some great stuff for humanity if you arent aware 3 there is a game of thrones mod for this game there are freakin game of thrones factions and characters in it that is amazing if you dont think it is amazing go make love to your sisterbrotherfathermotherauntunclenephewetc and then try to tell me with a straight face that it is not amazing

say goodbye to tomorrow have you ever had that feeling of wow summer is nearly over or maybe its almost the end of the month already prepare to have that feeling over and over again while playing the masterpiece of civilization v this is the kind of game that almost literally sucks you in and immerses you in its gameplay few games have the ability to keep you so focused that you lose track of time completely one beautiful aspect of sid meiers civilization v is how the game presents win conditions in many games today youre only given one option to finish a job and thats usually the option of killing everything on the screen that isnt the case with civ v while you can fight your way to the top you can also get through the game using clever diplomacy maybe instead of diplomacy youd rather develop your countrys scientific endeavors to win the space race you might be the kind of person who prefers art and culture though so you could also focus on that and become the most cultured civilization ever known all of these options are completely valid for clearing the game and you will be clearing the game quite often because the replay value is tremendous i thankfully bought all of the dlc while it was on sale but the dlc is some of the best ive seen after going through the base game several times the added content took all of the weaknesses of the original game and revamped them into wonderful strengths overall civilization v has incredible value and its nearly guaranteed youll be spending a few nights huddled near the glow of your monitor with a bowl of microwaved food

do not buy this game if you are impatience and does not have a lot of free time this game is so addictive 4 hrs just gone by recommended for a long holiday gaming session im totally hooked for this game only work stopped me from playing this 24 hr
recommended
one of the best if not the best game in the world strongly recommended
recommended
firstly and most importantly i have never played a civ game before secondly the first time i sat down and played civilization v i played for almost 8 hours consecutively the game is that addictive and i havent had that kind of hook on a game for years there are many ways to play and ultimately be the best civilization the game might look unappealing and boring to some but the game is really easy to understand yet extremely deep at the same time im mostly an fps person but this game is some of the most fun ive had playing a game ever
recommended
i absolutely love this game if you like turn based strategy games this is absolutely necessary to your virtual collection
recommended
i believe this game is great but many would disagree its the marmite of gaming up there with the well known monopoly board game its massively time consuming your friends will get angry if you keep asking them to play and you have to be a diehard fan of this form of game to bear with its tedious time consuming yet magnicificant piece of gaming masterpieces but it proves to me and many others as a shining beacon of which pulls you away from the painful dull and necessary work of life and into the gaping greatly lit tunnel of procrastination and determination to those ready to civ i salute you
recommended
i seriously cannot recommend this game enough its a strategy game but not a normal one this one is turnbased and it does it extremely well the game gives you that just one more turn mentality and before you know it you exit to desktop and 9 hours managed to pass by i highly recommend it to anyone who owns a pc as nobody should have trouble running it easily one of my most favorite games on steam
recommended
higgsfamily09 is a big fan of civilization we got three four and five  this one has some problems but in all it a great game if you are new to the game get this one it is user friendley love all the new leaders and civilization this game has  the graphics are great so do i recommend this game yes i do it is a great game fun to play the multiplayer is easy to learn

due to the fact i havent written any reviews for a long time i feel it is about time i started again with this unanimously magnificent strategy title what civilization v constitues is the climax of a renowned series to begin with it looks stunning and its world shines with beautiful and well designed environments futhermore when you start immersing yourself deeper inside its universe you will begin discovering more of its many virtues not only has this game one of the most sophisticated ingame mechanisms i have ever seen in a strategy title but also it can maintain your interest for years trying to offer a detailed insight into civ v could easily make me write pages over pages though i dont want to become tiresome just keep in mind that this game needs patience in order to unfold all its features on the whole i have no doubt that especially stategy friends are going to adore it

sid meiers civilization v is a 4x turnbased strategy from 2k games once you start playing this you cant stop civilization v is just a good game it has one more turn factor which makes you want to keep playing even when you already won sid meiers civilization v has very deep and challenging gameplay you start from scratch with only a settler and a warrior build your first capital city then keep building up your nationempire from the dark age of 4000 bc the dawn of human civilization to the modern globalization age of 2000 ad you forge your empire from a single capital city and then expand and build more city do research to strengthen your empire in all aspect create military power for defense purpose or go on a global conquest and manage your national economy culture and diplomacy with other faction every unit can be leveled up just like an rpg games which make every unit is unique and count you can even rename those unit when they level up to make them a little more personal choose your own path for your civilization war peace culture science all will lead you to great victory sid meiers civilization v has good graphics quality overall the maps are beautiful unit and city has quite good detail the ui is also great you can switch between tactical and world map view this game is very great and addicting sometimes which is most of the times even if you already won the game you still continue playing it i recommend this rating 910

im finally getting around to playing this after yearning for so long when it dropped in 2010 i couldnt play it on even medium settings as i tried out the demo well being an all or nothing guy i didnt want it until i had a pc capable of playing it at max settings with no hiccups that wasnt the only thing keeping me from the game but the announcement of the new hexagonal grid and one military unit per tile rule i was massively sceptical and honestly didnt think i would go for it well after waiting 4 years and playing religiously for the past week after purchasing it i can gladly say its the best move the series has made i cannot believe i never noticed how mundane stacking 20 units to a tile was to easily vanquish the enemy without thought now thinking and tactics come into play and you have to know each units attributes advantages and disadvantages and suddenly the game series with extrordinary depth just became that much deeper and more addictive its not without some faults that even with the most recent patch after years of its release still havent been fixed like for instance if you have no ground military unit in a city good luck accessing your missiles and other air units but these are minor and hardly take away from the yet another incredible addition or should i say addiction to the franchise 1010 will rack up far more than the current 47 hours ive put into it when all is said and done

theres no other game quite like it even eu ivck has a lower learning curve in comparison but its still a sizable beast to conquer there are lots of intricate mechanics and strategies you can find yourself learning hundreds of hours into the game oh and it takes forever to finish a game even on quick so if youre the impatient type this game may not be for you unless you go duelquick every game mp is fun ai becomes much too predictable so introducing the unpredictability of human thinking into the equation naturally mixes things up the team mechanics for coop are interesting at first but besides sharing beakers for research there really isnt much to it and you often end up fighting for things like wonders land and citystates like any competitor would also no achievements can be unlocked through mp except the one which is mindboggling as someone who dislikes the ai it is annoying having to jump back into sp to get the achievements i would otherwise have received through normal play balance wise there are some aspects that could be improved there are obviously superior wonders civs even resources im looking at you salt as well as obviously inferior ones like angkor wat denmark and most of the plantation luxuries some units also have pretty crappy ugprade routes  pikeman the most accessible and strongest medieval melee unit suddenly becomes an atbest situational anticavalry lancer and the crossbowman also the most accessible and strongest medieval ranged unit becomes a one range gatling gun range is huge in this game so increasing the damage in compensation for the lost one tile of range is like cutting someone then offering them a bandaid technical specifications wise the graphics are a nice upgrade from iv and for a game released in 2010 its fair some of the music is pretty awesome but theyre easily forgettable and as i already listen to other music while im playing turning off the music hasnt impacted me at all all in all a 910 i know most of my review has been negative but anything not mentioned here i generally endorse these were some more pedantic gripes and very subjective so as always take everything with a massive mound of salt those op ers ps obligatory one more turn

conquer the world outsmart the world outculture the worldthere are so many ways to play the game before i start i just wanted to say that its a very slow game it takes lots of hours to finish single games this doesnt necessary mean anything bad but a lot of people want quick paced games so just wanted to give a warning you build your civilization from the bottom to the end you make deals with your neighboring civs and conquer others or do whatever it takes to be the dominant civ build an empire pro the god of replayability tons of ways to play and win beutiful graphics decent ai with different personalities gandhi con very time consuming annoyingly slow loading screens if you are interested in the game make sure to grab the dlcsexpansions aswell to make the game as fun as possible

finally civ 5 reaches it potential with the release of brave new world i had to play it for many hours to gauge it all it is still missing one more expansion to finish fleshing the game out but its pretty good i love the 1upt mechanic but despise the warmonger penalty overall im very satisfied with the game in this state plenty of fun scenarios if you buy the complete version of the game lots and lots of replayability at the higher difficult settings

after playing vanilla gods and kings and finally spending 50 hours on brave new world i can finally review this i was very sceptical about civv after civiv i thought it couldnt be better and when i first saw civv i decided to stick to iv the vanilla game isunfinished there are features missing youd find in other civ games in the base game like religion with gods and kings the game finally becomes playable and is somewhat good but after buying brave new world i can finally say this game is worth it with all the features it gives you civv is a great 4x strategy game offering countless hours of fun damn with all the dlcs and expansions i cant even say which is better iv or v compared to previous civilization games i have to mention the new features like social policies and ideologies and caravans which are great and work really well civ v is also much easier to get into for new players than previous civ games city states are a new feature as well being friends with them brings you various benefits but you can play the bad guy as well and annex the hell out of them religion is very well made you practically make your own  select symbol name it and select perks which give you various bonuses you can also reform it later and add more perks despite my initial doubts the change from squares to hexes helped the game to feel more vivid changes to war unit system no more multiple military units on one field make the war more strategical and you can actually change the balance of power in the late game unlike in civiv where war in late game meant stalemate no matter how much units you pumped in  i love how the culture is remade it not only expands your cities but you also buy social policies with it and whats more with bnw you also generate tourism which can culturally influence other civilizations and take them over in short if you like 4x strategies get the complete edition of civv its totally worth it pros looks good with bnw its a true successor of civ series city states social policies and all other new features are very well made and fit together very well its so good its a timesinker cons ai turns take long to compute could be better optimized but no stuttering or lags rather textures unloading and reloading etc mods not working in multiplayer although they should according to their description its so good its a timesinker

civilization v is the newest installment in the series and is perfect for someone new to it such as myself from what i have seen civ5 seems much more suitable for newcomers with a less overly complicated ui and overall gameplay its not too simple though as 70 hours in im still using new tactics by using new aspects of the game to reach my goal this is the best strategy game i have ever played and without potentially 100s of hours of content with dozens of civs maps randomization mods and more this is a game i would recommend for anyone strategy fan or not easily a 1010 a gem of a game

sid meiers and his team have out done themselves with civ 5 they have successfully created a game that i believe to be one of the greatest strategy games of all time from its beautiful designed map to its incredible well layed out and detailed ui the game is almost flawless in civ 5 you have a range of empires to pick from and options that allow you to change map layout size and much more once you begin you will start with small city set 4000 years bc from here you build up that city and create others over time as they grow you will be jumping from technology to technology beginning with simple techs like pottery and ending in the future with a space race and giant machines with little to complain about and so much to be positive about this game is a must have for fans of the strategy genre

civilization 5 a game that made me feel irate and hate a lot of nations this is a game about building a kingdom and acquiring fame or in my case fear because i always ran in from the rear and torched the enemies buildings where upon i was quickly botched and murdered while me mate john watched it certainly requires tactics which fills my gaping cassum of desires like a big bottle of cider this type of gameplay is simple and soothing like a plane pilot before screaming mayday at least at first before youre cursed and find yourself coerced into huge wars that go on longer than my drinking at any bars with multiples nations that dont have much hesitation one awkward gaze and youll be bashed into a haze by five of the loons when youre just armed with a pair of spoons but with some mates in sight things became alright at least while they survive sometimes they wouldnt be alive long the blood thirsty nations flood you with all the troops they can spare in large scoops all because you have the kingdom that is up roaring in applause or you made the mistake to rake one of the smaller nations for their creations that everyone hated and requested to be berated anyhow no such thing as peace in this huge game of chess that you are at cease with 1 piece on the board of the many stored that are civilizations that resulted in nothing but huge cremations if you make nice and not threaten anyone but before youre beaten theyll practically speak some random squeak and before anything can be prepared you see it pop up war has been declared but dont worry with technologies at hand aided by the religious doxologies from downloadable content that adds a congress that is not flawless the leaders gang in times where id prefer them to hold a revolver to my head with a loud bang unless youre rich and not stuck looking like a dip switch you have not many delegates from a few city states to aid you because you got in heated debates to embargo you or not with friends of course in the end it is fun just sometimes extremely laggy but seemly unnoticed when the turns take longer everyone gets stronger each person having a massive army which makes the enemy become quite barmy moving them all sometimes lasts until next fall but we never cared because we shared each others help while hearing the enemy yelp while the staffing got left to clean up the mess we were laughing and heading to the next target thatd inevitably have a bloody carpet otherwise can recommend

this game is remarkable get this instead of the garbage that is beyond earth for those unfamiliar with this series you pick a great civilization from history rome china aztecs england etc and start with a single city from there you will be playing for hours and hours as games take a very long time and its fun as hell exploring making allies and enemies with the other civilizations going to war making more cities managing resources to fuel your conquest and racing against the other players in an attempt to win the game winning the game can be complex as there are several ways to win you can win by destroying the other civs through war win scientifically by making it into space culturally with social policies or diplomatically with the united nations the game is very dynamic not a single playthrough is at all similiar with another leading to great fun that never tires the pros too many to list the game is beautifully structured and well thought out the cons buggy ai but not really an issue point is rather reading this wordy review you should be buying this game with all the expansion packs i cannot praise this game enough

america was founded around 5000 bc germany built the pentagon ethiopia built the manhattan project russia has a democracy france nuked england england built the notre dame stonehenge was buit by demark vikings islam was founded in china 910 great strategy game actually teaches you about history as well as government and lets you rewrite history but bots  stupid and expanding  unhappiness im sorry but that doesnt make much sense the only thing i can gather is population but other than that its  you found a city and lose on average 4 happiness that makes zero sense although i guess our citizens are just up tight s who want to live in a crowded zone but theyre  about that too good job anyhow back to the positives for the price i bought the gold edition $1250 i would say this game is worth that now do i recommend buying this at $60 no i recommend you buy it around $040 the game has great mechanics and very well polished the sid meiers series almost never disappoints so if youre looking for a good strategy game this is for you

civilization v would be a very good game if it were not for the shoddy multiplayer and the money grubbing dlc practice firstly the average multiplayer match freezes and crashes even if you have less than four players in your match you will still crash frequently multiplayer is not designed well on this game there are too many gamebreaking glitches to name of which can only be done in multiplayer games this is because the developers did not pay much attention to polishing this portion of the game since they seem to have been very busy releasing the 15  pieces of dlc which were made for this game this dlc has only divided the very tiny multiplayer community further because it can be hard to find a match of people who have the same dlc as you the singleplayer is where this game shines the developers obviously spent a huge amount of time polishing this portion of the game and this is what gives it replay value you can easily spend six hours on a single game of civilization v and still want to play more there are a few balance problems however these are relatively small overall civilization v is my favorite game despite some of the games shortcomings

firaxis games live and die by their expansions amd civ v is no exception the base game feels dumbeddown to appeal to a massmarket boardgaming crowd and the gods and kings expansion adds tackedon variety but still no depth  systems have no meaningful interaction with each other and any one decision or strategy feels as good as another without any lasting consequence the brave new world dlc on the other handm finally gives civ v the depth you expect from a civ game with elegantly interacting system mechanics throughout and actions you take in the stone age still delivering payoffs thousands of years later with brave new world civ v turns from an unfocused and unengaging flop into a mustplay strategy title

do you like stategy games do you like board games well then look no further friend welcome home civilizations 5th iteration is a great entry in this franchise and is addictive as it is fun prepare to loose many hours some may tell you this one is a weaker game than 4 or not worth playing without all the dlc i am not really in that group i had a lot of fun with the vanilla game the expansions add depth to mid and late game stages and provide more options for victory along with new civilizations each which has its own perks if you have even a mild itch for strategy games then press buy also note this game is very moddable  all supported by steam workshop which couldnt be easier to use

i want to start off by saying this is a fantastic game but i think it is worth noting a few flaws to go alongside the many positives which this game has to offer and reading this review will hopefully help you in deciding whether it worth picking up a copy so first the pros this game has an ability like no other game ive played apart from aoe 2 to make time fly one moment its 4pm and before you know it youre hunched over besides your computer and its 11pm and you still havent done your maths paper for the day after the background for music for each civ is a nice addition which allows for each civ to feel unique beyond their colour scheme and unique buildingunits and ability so as you play them the melody keeps things interesting the gane looks great and is formatted nicely so everything is clean and easy to access and you rarely feel overpowered by an overabundance of numbers and now for some cons while at first and religion feels fresh and interesting as the game advances it quickly becomes a chore even with its increased importance for any deity or cultural victory thanks to bnw relgion i found to be much more interesting online vs other human players as they are likely to suffer from the same boredom you do and makes spreading your religion seem much more meaningful fun as a result i found myself sometimes being frustrated with a lack of some of the diplomacy tools the ai have such as the ability to call you out if you have troops surronding their border and i hope that for civ 6 the ai is smarter so this artificial difficulty does not need to be added my final issue with this game is the lack of balance you find in the policy trees and games can become stale as you do the same optimal opening strategy over and over now while you can go for a piety start it is rarely worth it unless youre trolling your friends online or have some incredibly situational strategy so all in all i think this is a great game for any pc gamer to pick up and the flaws i mentioned only really become a issue when youve played as many hours as i have so what are you waiting for go pick yourself up a copy now
recommended
honestly civ could very well be one of the best strategy games ive played though im more a fan of the rts type stuff if im being completely honest picked this up randomly due to a friend talking about the previous one and although the early game is a bit dull and repetitive its well worth the time invested multiplayer is amazing giving you more than the stereotypical kill your enemy by purchasing units approach that c&c and stronghold went with however that rush attack is still a really viable strategy for the warmongers like myself ^^ as much as ive fallen in love with civ its diverse victory conditions and its generally good gameplay it falls a bit flat for me at points the graphics will sometimes bug out randomly though rarely enough to break the game also if youre playing offline against computers you may as well go solely for domination or a quick cultural victory as diplomacy is nonexistent ai will attack you after you give them trades return units and declare friendships which takes away from the overall experience  so play either hotseat mode with a couple friends or find a few players in the community online to play with if you want to get the most out of it prepare for a long game as civ can last quite some time the learning curve isnt so bad but its not a jump in and play game for sure  you really need to get the nuances down and read the tooltips that say what things can do fortunately the advisors arent half bad at keeping you posted all in all worth the purchase so go ahead pick this game up and see if your civilization can withstand the test of time pros awesome gameplay can win through multiple methods graphics are typically good barring some random sporadic glitches not a steep learning curve  you can get the basics in one or two games tops has a hotseat mode for a more oldschool multiplayer approach big deal if you have no internet or want to play with people who dont own the game tons of options to change the game as you please no barbarians victory types etc lot of modded content for those looking to spice the game up cons ai is frustrating other leaders will go from allied to at war in a matter of seconds for no real reason loading times can be long with multiple players graphics can bug out at times could use a little more variety across the board just my opinion montezuma go play a round against him and youll get that

sid meiers civilization v is a magnificent turnedbased strategy game you select a civilization start a city and build your empire in many ways unlike some strategy games civilization v can be won in more than one way these victories are cultural scientific diplomatic time and domination with the several different types of victory this in turn shapes how you play the game giving way to some unique strategies while the base game may not come with nearly as much content as it would with the two expansion packs its still sufficient enough to have lots of fun with it would be in your best interest to get one or both of the expansion packs for civilization v they add much new content ranging from civilizations to changing some aspects of gameplay ie traderoutes in brave new world i find myself playing for hours on end even if i play the game on quick theres no shortage of gameplay here and youll always be coming back for just that one extra turn the modding community it exists its great always an added bonus to any game modding support and a large modding community as you may have noticed in the tools section of the steam library civilization v comes with its own sdk source development kit to assist you in making mods and maps maps are very simple to make and modifying the games xml format files requires merely a text editor xml is a fairly simple data storing language and can be modified quite easily if you decide to get more into modifying the game and get lost there are many guides online to help you through your journey i whole heartedly recommend getting sid meiers civilization v for yourself especially when on sale its a bargain you cant beat there are some minor setbacks to the gameplay such as experiencing slightly elongated waiting periods after pressing the next turn button during the lategame period this may or may not be because of my older hardware going on 7 years and more often then not doesnt show up at all ive not been experiencing any elongated waiting periods as of approximately july 2014 i currently run the game on maximum settings at 1920 x 1080 resolution

quick summary of the game build a nation from the ancient era to the present day warning never play this game at night you will keep telling yourself this just one more turn and then ill go to bed well that turn could turn into 20 turns and before you know it 3 hrs have passed seriously this is a brilliant game for anyone who likes risk every playthrough is dynamic and awesome also there is a wide variety of civilizations to choose from though each civilization is simile they have different unique units that are a ton of fun to control in addition each civ leader speaks in their native language now thats some impressive research something that may be a problem is that even though now the ai in brave new world has been tuned down a bit they were too agressive in the earliar dlcs like gods & kings and probably wont provoke you into unnescessary war  it feels they are too passive as no bot provokes you anymore except when you deliberately do so when the main content gets boring the comunity has done some great mods that keep the experience ongoing such as maybe a new civilization or a new map design like middle earth from lord of the rings in conclusion i recomend this game highly for anyone who is a big fan of history

in sid meiers civilzation v you can play as one of the many historical nations of the world from both past and present from there you build expand make war make deals adopt policies and research lastly maintaining your economy and the overall happiness of your citizens you can also play as a mod civilzation some like sparta for example vlad the impaler the three kingdoms of ancient china and also play on player created maps ranging from the elder scrolls series to game of thrones and also with online you can play with your friends andor other players but be warn if you make any save during that match it is highly wise you know the people first last thing you want is an epic matching occuring and then suddenly the player no longer shows up after a day or two there are many things to do in this game from customizing your match playstyle both online and on singleplayer plus testing your skills in scenario modes another cool thing as well is the animations in the dipolmatic menu when dealing with other leaders although if you dont have a hig rig pc it is wise to turn that off completely and dont play for too long in my personal experience with this game it is always wise to have the autosave saving at least around 3 turns you make a slight problem with this game is the ai sometimes they make really odd choices like for example instead of surrending they fight it out till the end or if you take down half of their cities and embargo their civilzation from making trade instead of making peace and trying to find comproise they will still act like idiots and still wage war even on the lowest setting as i find out also be warn as well if you play this game on higher diffculty my advice take your time and plan everything out if you dont plan very well you will be crushed at this point it is wise to get all of the dlc since the majority of the mods rely on them other than that i recommend this game

civilization 5 is a great game it is the first turn based strategy game that i have bought i have had many hours of fun either in singleplayer or in multiplayer although the graphics for the game are not brilliant good if you havent spent lots of money on your pc it still captures you into emersive game play the game at first can seem complicated and hard but you quickly learn how to effectively play the game and win a game this may not seem to be impressive f you havent played civilization 5 but trust me when you have played you will know what i mean if you have a lot of time on your hands or even little this is a good game for you because you can alter the game speed to suit you from the fastest been quick they put a lot of effort into the name and the slowest been marathon seems they got someone more creative to think of that name the me can take a long time on standard speed but is does all depend on what difficulty you go for as civilization 5 gives you a range of options like the other civilizations depending on if you want to become leader of the world through violence and tyranny turning all the other civs against you a domination victory then on the other hand you can be peaceful and gain friendship with the civs gaining a technological victory or a cultural victory these are just some of the victorys you can achieve the technological victory is one of the hardest to achieve as basicaly it means be the first to get to alpha centauri which is another planet far far away so of course this means building a space ship the domination victory is very clear through the word domination just control the capital of every other civ in the game as a warning though other civs do not think very highly of someone who attacks other civs so they will attack you only if you attack a few of them the cultural victory is one of the hardest victorys to get this is because it takes a long time and you need to play as the right civ that is got traits that gain them extra culture a good civ to play as is napoleon because he gains culture from chateaus the game has a lot of dlcs but luckily for you if you are considering getting civilization 5 they have stopped making dlcs and are making cilization 6 this may sound like civ 6 is coming out soon but no one knows so steam have made it so for 3499 you get civilization 5 and all 11 dlcs including bnw brave new world and gak gods and kings this is a very good deal considering individualy it cost 7835 so it is better than half priceand the dlcs make the game soooo much better its worth every penny for a game where there is so much you can do either in muliplayer or in singleplayer giving you many hours of fun it is worth getting i highly reccomend this game

a really fun game to play used to play this on the xbox the xbox version which i used to play all the time when i could or had time i highly recommend this game to you all if you like long endurance games where you start of with a group of settlers and grow your empire to be the strongest and rule the world

sid meiers civilization v is the kind of game that almost anyone can get into even if you are a diehard fps player you will likely find some amusement in this game civilization v offers a vast variety of ways to play the game ranging from a campaignesque scenario mode to custom games where you pick and choose your opponents and possibly allies what kind of map you will be fighting for and what you will need to do to win do you want to conquer the world get a giant earth map add a dozen or two opponents and fight for world domination do you want to start your own religion and watch it spread across the globe like a true pandemic well start one send off your missionaries and start an inquisition you will be supreme pope of yourcultnamehere soon do you want to play out historical battles throughout the history well not much else to be said than you can some people might enjoy setting the difficulty setting all the way down and steamrolling their opponents others might do the opposite and try for the challenge of beating the game with a severe handicap playstyle plays a huge part in how you will enjoy civ5 but once you start a map it is as if it will never end the multiplayer aspect of the game has both upsides and downsides when playing with others you need to coordidnate who does what and it can trim parts of the game from your own experience as in you have to share certain wonders it is not beneficial to have multiple religions and it will suck fighting for superiority beyond that it can be great divvying up an opponents land between you and your friend for example get civilization v it is definitely one of my alltime favorites one more turn

sid meiers civilization v positives  this is an indepth turn based strategy game it features a massive technology tree for the ancient classical medieval renaissance industrial modern and future eras conduct research to unlock new buildings and units  multiple victory styles to suit your own gameplay goals aim for world domination or try for a cultural victory by constructing world wonders and acquiring great works of music writing and art build the first spacecraft through the apollo program to win a science victory  lots of units available for each era ranging from archers and cavalry to giant death robots and xcom specialist squads  theres a well fleshed out system for city development and unit recruiting whereby you need to balance your productive output with your food and gold output for your empire to be successful you need to work the land with citizens appropriately the more food you have the faster your town grows but this usually comes at the expense of production resulting in longer building times  this is the ultimate empire building game workers can construct roads between cities and later on railways they can erect plantations on exotic goods like wine and sugar or ensure resources like stone and gold are extracted with mines settlers can found a city in faraway countries  dlc adds a lot of new features like religion and tourism which impacts the game a fair bit and makes it more interesting  battles with enemies seems boring at first but soon you realise that its much more intricate the positioning of your troops the type of unit the terrain youre on and unit capabilities directly affect your damage or defensive rating so battles become quite intriguing  multiplayer coop negatives  stupid diplomacy system which doesnt make much sense theres several faults here you can be allied to another civilization for thousands of years renewing the friendship agreement when it expires but the simplest of transgressions results in them denouncing you for example in one of my games my spy successfully stole technology without being detected but somehow the ai knows that youve taken this research and threatens me very unrealistic when you denounce them in return theyre suddenly hostile and then attack soon after there doesnt seem to be any complex formula governing diplomacy its so simplistic the ai doesnt take into account your previous good standing with them or mutual objectives it doesnt recognise your past support for them in wars and trading doesnt seem to have much positive diplomatic influence or effect this really ruins a core part of the game  ai can be overly aggressive on normal difficulty and above it always seems as if its scripted and the ai has decided to target you even if you take the initiative early on and conquer another civilization theres another ready to invade you this happened on multiple occassions to me it would be fine if there was some logical reason behind their attacks or if other civilizations experienced the same struggles but its not like that at all overall score 8010 sid meiers civilization v is a grand strategy game filled with many hours of content it can be really really fun but also quite unrealistic at the same time the game has many pros and only a few cons i suggest buying civilization v  gold edition which is cheap and has most dlc included along with the gods and kings expansion the only package which isnt included is brave new world but thats not necessary to enjoy the game

civ 5 is one of the best strategy games i have ever played there are tons of scenarios to play if you are into those most of the play time for many people is playing against ai you can choose from multiple difficulties to play on the harder the diffuculty the more the ai have the advantage civ 5 has tons of civilizations to play as each with their own unique advantages i would say the best part of civ 5 is during the medieval and industrial time periods these are times where i have the most fun at the reason i dont really like the modern era is becuase the game usually feels drawn out and boring by that time but if you go to your game options and start the game during the medieval era then the modern era will feel a lot more fun overall civ 5 is a really fun game and has an endless play time to it i would recommend civ 5 to anyone even if you are not into stategy games

just one more turn is civilizations unofficial motto anyone who played the game and enjoyed it will understand known as the biggest turnbased strategy game today with its rather unique hexagon tiled playfield civilization has entertained many throughout its lifespan  myself included i used to play a bunch load of civilization iii as a kid and civilization v has done a wonderful job of replacing that for the past 4 years back in the days turnbased strategy games were pretty common but today it feels like most games are realtime turnbased means you take turns to make your move rather than everyone making them at the same time like in every traditional board game evidently sid meiers civilization v is the fifth game in the series and it has really just gotten better and better by every game the core mechanics are always there but with some variation between each game the fanbase is rather scattered when it comes to agreeing on the best civilization game a lot of people still prefer civ iv personally i love civ iii a lot but civ v takes the prize the main problem with civilization v when it came was the lack of content compared to what civ iv already had today 4 years later tons of dlcs and 2 expansions have been released for the game and it finally has more content than its predecessor the game is about to create reign and fulfill a civilization throughout hundreds of years and overcome the obstacles alongside either online or vs computers explore expand exploit and exterminate  4x  is the best way to describe the typical steps when playing a game of civilization explore is for the first section of the game where you settle your first city and scout the surounding area for resources or opponents expand is when your small settlement becomes several either through settling another one or through conquest exploit is the description of diplomacy treaties spionage and rigging elections to make your cause the ultimate exterminate is pretty obvious if diplomacy or expantion does not work take the matter by the sword or the nuclear warhead there are 4 way of winning and becoming the master civilization cultural diplomatic scientific and by domination along those victory types are also paths for your civilization to easier obtain said victories for example you could focus your empire on trade and become a superpower through riches essentially buying votes for a diplomatic victory units for domination or technology for science you could also be the founder of a religion and slowly but steadily gain your trust from the people of other civilizations that way i was hoping to see a pure economical and religious victory condition but sadly there are none it feels like i have done pretty much everything in civilization v since its release but i still get really tempted to get back in there and just let the hours disappear suddenly you sit there 5 am in the morning and be like what the hell just happened i am not 12 anymore i have a fcking job i remember when i used to plan my next move during bathroom breaks i couldnt even think of something else for 5 minutes just one more turn i am really looking forward to civilization vi and civilization beyond earth i recommend civilization v for everyone not just strategy fans but everyone interested in having control and making decisions for an imaginary empire or if you just have a lot of time to spend i ensure you that you wont be disappointed

civilization v is an amazing turn based strategy game in which the goal is to rule the world through battle culture science or diplomacy the new hexagonal grid tiles allow for much more interesting gameplay than the previous games in the series the game allows the player to choose from a variety real civilizations each with their own unique perk unit and building while this game features multiplayer capabilities the games take a very long time to complete and take more than most people are willing to invest in a single session if you do have a lot of free time it can be very satisfying to dominate the world with or against friends id very highly recommend this game particularily in conjunction with its downloadable content and expansions
recommended
great game i reccomend having patience if you are going to buy this game a beautiful strategy game of whatif for example what if the great wall of china was made by america the great wall of america well thats possible watch yourself holding history in your hands and bending it to your will 1010 great game d
recommended
civilization v is by far one of the best civilization games i have ever played the game takes awhile to play through both online and offline but rewards the player with both a sense of progression as the ages unlock and the technology advances also the game has multiple ways to win and even if you feel your in the lead in science a friend can come out of nowhere and hit you with a culture vicotry so you have to not only be productive towards your victory goal but also monitoring all the other victory types to make sure no other civilization completes it before you i would highly recommend buying the complete pack when its on sale so you dont have to worry about dlc issues and not having a civilization that an opposing player wants to play as the game requires all active players to have the dlc in order to play against eachother and use a dlc civilization so be aware of this if you debating between the base game and its expansions or the complete pack with all dlc hope you enjoy civilization as my as i do and cant wait for civilization beyond earth to come out 
recommended
being a strategy game it is one of my all time favourite games of all time after the hours i have played i have become hooked and cant stop playing good things the gameplay is fun you have so many things you can go into but being the obvious science and domination are the main two things to go fourth to i like that if your computer can not handle the full graphics of the game or you just want to have a faster and better view so you can see the resources around you you can always switch to the strategic view pressing f10 bad things it is very time consuming yet addicting the amount of time it takes to complete a full game requires you to play with friends most of the time and not random people so you can always save and go back to it any time you want to

love this game i myself am a huge fan of the civ series

civilization v let me just start with this is an amazing game coming from a vetran of the older games i was at first scared to try the new stuff but once i got into civ v i never looked back btw civ iii is like a rage game try it at your own risk here are my pros and cons pros crisp clean modern graphics that still follows the look of a civilization game the leaders animations and looks are outstanding no unit stacking first i frowned at this but began to love it in previous civ games cirtain battles felt like my stack vs the other guys stack of units which felt sloppy in a since in retrospec combat takes strategy now not numbers advanced diplomacy and city states diplomacy in the origional civ v is meh but gods & kings and brave new world fix that easily city states makes the world feel more alive even if your on an island by yourself a city state there gives it life diplomatic victory is just as entertaining if not more than a domination victory the political struggles to hold delegates and get your proposals passed is a blast and cultural victory with the tourism bnw is very very thought provoking the add mod feature encourages its fanbase to be creative with making fun senarios pc master race ftw probably so much more pros that i cant think of atm so ill stop here  cons the only cons i can come to think of is happiness until you get an ideology or of the like your happiness seems a real challenge to keep up expecially in a war game but yet again i play on prince on lower difficulties this isnt a problem warmongering most ai seem very quick to neclect trading and deals with you if they suspect you of a warmongerer i go to war with france with the persians and take no cities and the arabians are denouncing me already if you resonably go to war for a cause they are responsible for you become the joseph stallin of the world my only complaint would be to tone this down a little other than that this game is a blast like the addict i am ive played over 1k hours of this game so i hope this helps 1010 would restart account and get achevements again

review for civilization v with gods and kingsbrave new world november 2013 civilization v may have gotten off to a rocky start the streamlined interface and the removal of staples such as unit stacking were a bit of a shock and the feeling was different with patching and updates however civilization v has grown into its own game that stands apart from its predecessors i wont say its better than previous games i wont say the historic immersion is the same although brave new world goes a long way to making that come back so unfortunately coming into civ v after playing a previous civ game will feel awkward and possibly unsatisfying but this is a game that rewards you with the time you put into it it gets better as you play it what remains missing however is the diplomacy the expansions have done a lot to repair the broken diplomacy system and it works much better than before but there remains a lack of choices for the player many systems from previous games such as spying tech stealing and religion have been restored magnificently to the game in the expansions but remain missing from the base version with brave new world a lot of the community feels that the game is now on par with the previous game civilization iv beyond the sword im not sure i agree but it certainly is a close call civilization v is far less tedious than civ iv but still not as immersive most of the complaints about civilization v come from older players familiar with older civ games but civilization v is a great starting point for the series and strategy games in general compared to similar games like europa universalis or even civilization iv civilization v is very easy to learn and has an intuitive interface and adjustable difficulty even on higher difficulty the game features unobtrusive advice which you can choose to follow no matter if youre a newcomer or a civveteran civ v still has the infamous one more turn addictiveness this series is known for and overall this is my favorite game on steam currently and i often have recommended it to people its an allaround great game  original recommendation june 2012 this is not the most satisfying civilization game it may be one of the most fun however the classic game is still there streamlined and reengineered so that less time is spent micromanaging and more time is spent planning your conquest of the world the graphics are the best of any civ game so far and there are many gameplay surprises that keep you replaying and trying out new things it is becoming one of my alltime favorites

probably the best strategy game to approach with a group of friends with the intention of partaking in a saga of epic battles and journeys to conquest and probably the best strategy game that amounts to simply flubbing around with your friends in merely a matter of minutes games are rather slow even on the fast game settings stay away from epic if you value your lifespan and playing with that one guy that always takes at least 5 minutes to finish his turn can be very much agonising think five player chess wait times the payoff however more than makes up for it the feeling of carrying your army across the continent to royally screw over your friend who you were suppossedly allied with is like none other as is launching a nuke at every neighbouring country and bribing chengis khan to mount an attack at the vatican rounds may take a few hours but youll be talking about them for the next week fans of the previous civ games may however be a little disappointed with this edition as it seems a few majorly awesome mechanics have been removed along with with a whole bunch of not so awesome mechanics even religions are nowhere to be found within vanilla but thankfully both brave new world and gods and kings restore all that was missing to make civ v as great as its predecessors between some fantastic dlc and steam workshop functionality you can play as cthulu in the world of tamriel and found pastafastarianism civ may not be a perfect game to please all but its certainly as close as it gets in terms of civilisation

for all time strategy fans this gme is a must buy the flawless take on a turn by turn strategy franchise makes the game not only stand out against its competitors in the industry but also allows the game to boast its golden reputation and show off its most impressive new features while there are a few unbalanced things in the game such as how a millitary victory is much easier to achive than other means the game still manages to get that tone between being complicated enough for veterans of the series and welcoming to newcomers the change from squares to hexagons is a bold one but yet again maxis an their brilliant team have done it again like i just mentioned the game has changed to hexagons rather than stayed at squares and the game surely flexes its muscles but you probably knew that already what you really want to know is what have maxis done to the civilazation series did they break it after all the series has never seen such a huge overhall before and its assuming the title from a game thats earned its golden reputation well im not going to make your mind up for you old veterans of the franchise but civilizations 5 blows each competitor out of the water one by one every animation in the game has been redone the ai is much smarter though that still dosent make them smart and the diplomacy pannel while it may be lacking in many ways compared to games like crusader kings it is a massive improvement for more on civilization 5 and boy is there a lot more buy the game on steam now this game really has shown us what companies can do when given unlimated time and money look at gta 5 and lastly this game it appears will stand the test of time

you there are you able to steer every part of a budding nation to greatness do you want to squabble with other nations over resources like bananas and uranium are you able to deal with montezuma declaring war with you every fifteen turns or so can you stop that scheming  gandhi from nuking you to extinction if you answered yes to all or at least most of these questions then you should try out civilization v you wont be disappointed i havent played the other civilization games so im not sure how they compete but this game is certainly friendly to newcomers to the series the game is very intuitive and helps you keep the game moving by pointing out what you still need to do this turn before letting you move on to the next no more checking every unit and every city six times like in the total war games the game offers several options for victory you can simply kill em all you can send a spaceship to alpha centauri to prove your technological dominance you can make your civilisation the cultural center of the world or you can win through diplomacy by earning votes in the united nations that is as soon as you build it yes you theres several ways in which your civilization has to compete with their rivals theres luxury resources scattered across the map which are vital in keeping your empire happy theres strategic resources which are required to build certain units and buildings factories require coal for instance theres city states which will favor the most helpful or most generous civilization and grant them the earliermentioned resources and of course theres the everlasting race to keep your economy and military up to par with the other players each player is outfitted with a unique ai but you can also choose to randomize them to keep the game unpredictable all in all this game offers more strategies than countable what do you research first where do you send your new citizen to work where are you going to settle your new city how many cities do you need for your plan for world domination anyway will you build a wall to defend yourself or a library to speed up your research and so on tldr version plenty of tactics to be found here if you like turnbased strategy games this ones for you

overhelming holy master of strategy [kamgustas review] i always tried to play civilization but the outdated graphics and the 2d squared tiles never managed to catch my interest with civilization v they finally introduced hexagonal tiles and a rich 3d world so i grabbed the gods & kings expansion and gave it a try at first the game is overhelming with informations and details but it will take you hand by hand and introduce all the mechanics step by step after 30 hours and 493 turns i finished my first play and i was able to manage almost everything this game is simply gargantuous there are tons of things to do and manage there are dozens of leaders each one with its strenghts and weaknesses there are 5 different ways of winning a game and you can customize the map in even the smallest detail there are also premade scenaries steamworks support and a very populated multiplayer simply wow just three advices 1 do not read the tips and tricks or they will ruin your fun showing the best strategies there arent so much so knowing these may lower your fun of trying new ways to beat the other civilizations 2 buy the expansions these are not moneysucker dlcs but they really improve the base game 3 always keep an eye on the clock i started playing it at 2300 and i left the game at 600 with conquered cities allies powerful armies and frozen legs it sucked 7 hours of my life without me realizing best played with keyboard and mouse recommended buy price < 50$ score 910

sid meiers civilization v really changed my opinion about strategy simulation games this game is very diverse and no two games are alike you start out as a civilization with one city and you slowly build your way up to be the dominator the diplomatic leader or the first to finish the space race not only all this but it is historically accurate

civilization 5 pros turn based strategy city building 5 ways to win large quantity of nations cons errors ai issues great replay value one thing civilization 5 does great is make the game so fun you dont want to quit you wont want to go to bed do homework take a much needed shower or go to work the truth about this game is that it makes you want to keep playing you will think to yourself its 1130 i need to go to bed then think ill be alright one more turn then im done next time you look at that clock its 544 and i have class in three hours city builder something that i love about civilization 5 is the city building aspect of the game being able to customize what each city produces or specialize that city can give you a huge advantage over your opponents if you want your city to be able to produce tons of troops or want it to be a mecca for scientific advancement you have the ability to customize you can make any city what you want or need it to be winning with any game that is a city builder there are many ways to win my personal favorite is to conquer the world crushing armies the feeling when an enemy player comes to you and offers everything they have to save their capital is the best feeling in the world other ways of winning are being the first person to build the space station or having a culture that influences other nations one of the hardest victories to achieve is the diplomatic victory you need to have the rest of the world like you enough to elect you to world leader errors ai issues my biggest complaint about this game is the errors that still exist after four years i wouldnt say its game breaking but very annoying when you have spend five to seven hours and are close to the end game when the game crashes then to combine this issue the ai needs to be reworked to make smarter decisions while at war the ai will continue to suicide units into cities when they could easily take the cities by using archers or other ranged units to weaken the city price best thing about civ 5 is that the price you get a great game that gives you hours if not years of gameplay even tho it has been out since 2010 its well worth the asking price on steam you can pick this game up for $30 or get the complete edition for $40 the complete edition comes with more civs and two expansion packs that add a lot of new gameplay features and just builds on an amazing game

it is dope

warning this game is ridiculously addictive i bought this game a while back and never really had a chance to sit down and give it my full attention but when i did decide to do so i was glued to my seat a playthrough that i originally thought would last a half hour quickly become a 13 hour marathon and after many defeats  being a noob i still felt like going back for more each time being rewarded for my persistence by learning or discovering something new about this wonderful game if you havent bought this already what are you waiting for

1 buy it 2 never press next turn ps dont  with gandhi

it is civilization the most popular and well known turnbased strategy game of all time this version is still as good as the older versions when you have all the expansions i would recommend you get the gold or complete version of this one the new hex tiles add an interesting level of strategy to the game no longer can you have a one tile army taking over countless cities instead you have to plan ahead with artillery ranged units in the back infantry in the front and cavalry on the sides this one is definatly worth getting replayability is high you will have countless hours of fun
recommended
just look at the amount of time reviewers have spent playing this game yeah its that good as other reviewers have mentioned the game is newbfriendly i was brand new to the civ franchise but thanks to the advisor system in the game i was able to pick up the basics very quickly after youve started feeling comfortable or if you are not a newb in the first place those advisors can easily be turned off in the options this is a fantastic strategy game that will keeping you thinking for hours even when youre not playing the gameplay is rich deep and complex ive spent over 400 hours with this game and i still notice new things and consider different strategies i started playing games on warlord difficulty level 3 of 8 and ive advanced enough that i feel pretty confident on emperor now 6 of 8 i recommend watching some deitylevel lets plays to help develop your understanding of the game and to consider some new strategies civ 5 is also stunningly beautiful however you can play it on older systems when i got the game i was running a 2006 dell dimension e521 with an amd athlon 64 3800 and an nvidia gt9500 which i put in specifically so i could do some gaming and it ran just fine on low to medium settings it just got more beautiful when i built my new rig with a 4th gen intel i7 and gtx760 and could run it on max settings the music is also spectacular im still listening to it not muting it like some other games i play during gameplay even after 400 hours i have all the dlc and i would highly recommend you go ahead and get the complete edition bare minimum though get the brave new world expansion it adds so much richness to the base game enjoy building a civilization that will stand the test of time

recommended
audio superb aesthetic impressive memorability strong worth full price pros civilopedia and tutorials have gotten a bit of an upgrade from civ4 and are now more palatable to new users the game is workshop friendly and the community is actively perpetuating content for it expansions actually have purpose and add dimension to the game with all these new features the games depth and strategy is no longer confined to country tierlists hexstyle grid was a great addition and feels very natural cons as a longstanding fan of the civilization series i cant say i like the movement away from the board game feel of older installments civ2 and civ3 specifically the graphics and animations are a bit unnecessary to me for this reason though they are excellentlydone and very beautiful overall my qualms with this game are entirely from the point of nostalgia at the end of the day im willing to say goodbye to my virtual risk board game in favor of what civ is blossoming into as a series a highlycomplex strategy game that is a blast to share with likeminded friends score 1010

civ 5 is an amazing high definition strategy game which requires a lot of thinking and skill i have been led into massive wars and online multiplayer with friends is just pure fun you start in the ancient era and can end up researching all the way into the future era massive full scale wars never fail to impress me and the multiple different ways of winning is very interesting i still have yet to go through all the paths of winning 9210

the best game ever made civilization has been around since i can think i dare say that start in the late 80ies since about 1990 i played civ 1 civ 2 civ 3 and for years i played civilization 4 and thought it could not get better but it did civilization 5 takes it to a new level everything has so much more meaning is simpler or just makes more fun let me give you some examples combat system in every part of civ before this was determined by how many units can you possibly stack on one field march through enemy territory and wreak havoc now in civ 5 tactics really matters move your units carefully organize a retreat of heavily wounded veterans and bring fresh units to the front range units finally have a range terrain matters i was sceptic playing a demo of civ 5 some years back but im converted religion & diplomacy in civ 4 religion was only about bringing in some extra cash once you built the holy shrine of that religion now it has meaning you can customize your religion to match the victory you strive for heading for a military victory give your units a combat bonus near cities of your religion and prepare your conquest with missionaries going for culture pick a belief that grants you bonus culture from terrain around your cities great city states  first i thought what useless crap they were again im converted a diplomatic victory is much fun and you can easily spoil other players bloodthirst with winning diplomatically before being conquered ideologies the modern age pendant to religion again you can decide between three different ways of winning and customize it to your needs and its all so easy i have the feeling they added more features to civilization while at the same time making it more simple scenarios my god scenarios theres loads of them and the official ones provide an incredibly deep playing experience story historical background its amazing it even pushed me to publish strategy guides on my own blog ___________________________________ so if youre still not sure whether you should go for it  trust people who have more than 1000h play time do it get it play it enjoy it have fun
recommended
do not purchase this game if you want to do anything else prepare to wonder where the time went wonder why you havent eaten all day and wonder what that stain on your chair is civ 5 is the ultimate time sink even more so than any illegitimate children you might have barbies op

sid meiers civilization v is the best strategy game ive played the new hex grid tile system works extremely well for combat allowing for a much more strategic intellectual battle sadly the game doesnt fully feel complete without both the gods & kings and brave new world dlc packs g&ks revamps the technology tree adds more buildings units and civilizations includes an espionage system and adds a religion system to the game bnw adds a new cultural systemvictory new civilizations ideologies trade routes and a world congress both dlc packs are a musthave for the full complete experience be prepared to be a victim of just one more turn

great game the vast amount of ways to win and loose in this game make it full of replayabilitie to play as diffrent civilizations games can last for hours and the back stabbing the secret relations war this game is just fantastic the game can get a little slow in the start especialy if you are playing alone but it really pics up a few turns in especially if you play with freinds if you play you will have a complete distaste for barbarians after you experience this game 810

one of the best turn based 4x strategy games out there civilization v is vastly improved by the expansions gods & kings and brave new world so i would reccommend picking those up if you are considering civilization v this game is great at allowing you to expand your civilizations through any way possible whether it be by war diplomacy or your economy the game doesnt stale as you head into the late game because of the world congress and idealogies you are able to pick up once you get closer to the atomic era idealogies does a great job of creating rivals and allies as you align with the people you share idealogies with this game is relatively easy to run and can be accessible to most poeple the multiplayer is fun if you can find friends to play with as it is more interesting playing with people you known there are some faults with multiplayer as the game will often reload itself for no apparent reason overall great game and is a must own for anyone that enjoes 4x strategy games
recommended
the depth and replayability are unsurpassed it took a couple of expansions to catch up to the enjoyment i felt playing its predecessors but now with all of the new systems in place it has become one of my favorite iterations in the series thank you sid meiers brian reynolds jeff briggs microprose hasbro infogrames atari interactive taketwo 2k games firaxis and any others i am forgetting for providing me with years of such boundless entertainment i can only imagine what the future holds for such an amazing and storied franchise

for those who are not familiar with the civ games sid meiers civiliazation is a simulation of how and why the political statusquo is as it is today in randomly generated map though its not your only option play the leader of a slightly to heavily flavoured nation and quest for world dominition either kill everyone make them love you make a utopia or be the first to send the rocket to space sometimes youll be the baddy sometimes youll the curse the vandal leader who will play purely combat while you build your latest wonder this games realism is really informative and there are many things to learn from this simulation its replayability is one of its strongest points since youll definitely want to try again for a better setting resources and other civ placement different map size different nation etc for those familiar with previous installments is there anything better than a resuscitation of a game you already love with new graphics newdifferent nations and a slightly different approach to some of the mechanics i cant say this is wholly an improvement or a deterioration in terms of realism since although the diplomacy is much better and a diplomatic victory is actually an option now the religion mechanic for example is more of game nature than the more realistic civ 4 counterpart this is less blocky and repetitive than civ4 and much easier to play though you may not like all the changes no more stack of doom p

great game and gets better with expansions
recommended
this game allows you to unleash the inner sadistic dictator that we all are underneath burning cities and ravaging the countryside engaging in a preemptive strike against gandhi i was able to keep him in the renaissance era while everyone else moved on into the modern era preventing him from nuking me or anyone else in the future in the meantime i took part in the very practice i claimed to condemn and sent two consecutive atomic bombs to amsterdam this game allowed me to engage in a foreign policy similar to the usas without the real life worldwide scorn and condemnation 1110 the only thing i would add to the game is the ability to stage false flag terror attacks to further the realism
recommended
this is a game ill put many hours into ive only put in 20 hours and i still dont know how to win but im having fun edit i finally found out how to win there are 4 ways to win which makes things interesting domination victory is the most straightforward way to win ive been trying to get a culturescience victory by not building an army so i can focus on my culturescience and by being nice to everyone so they dont attack my defenseless country with no military but i always end up getting a diplomatic victory instead for being nice to everyone

sid meier delivered yet again with the latest and debatably greatest installment of the civilization franchise civilization v im not going to pretend i have played hundreds of hours on this game as you know i havent becuse it says aboveedit yeahhhhhh this game is addictive but from what i have played of this game makes it one of my absolute favourites in my library i personally am not usually the fan of strategy games because i havent got the brain capacity to work out simple war strategies but this game had me hooked from the begining so much so even that i managed to convince my dad to buy it which he is now playing by my side religiously i know i have tried and failed to sound intelligent so i will just say it how it is buy this game the only fault i could possibly pick with this game is a few bugs that will inevitabley be fixed and the occasional crash i would highly recommend that you save the game every 5 turns to avoid loss because of crashes but what the hell do i know maybe its my  laptops fault all in all the game is very fun highly addictive seriously time consuming and life destroying but however needs some polishing 910
recommended
pros i can play this game casually and competitively all the civs mean you can have alot of replayability i personally find this fun and can play it in long sessions mods are fun simple learning curve cons if you plan to play multiplayer games then you have to buy dlcs which is expensive bugs are rare but they can be game breaking and barely fixed overall a great game 910
recommended
4k fans will love this game those from an rts background looking to try out turnbased strategy will be disappointed in the fact that combat victories are essentially impossible in games of more than 4 playersnpcs the game is too heavily slanted towards other victory acheivements it is too difficult to conquer cities and happiness makes a global conquest strategy through military might nigh impossible because eventually your armies will simply be spread too thin and enemies will too easily be able to reinforce their positions on large maps i still recommend it though for 4k people but coming from a command & conquerstarcraftwarcraft background i cant get out of the conquest mindset and the other strategies arent to my taste if you enjoy the longer slowerpaced games which involve meticulously building up a civilization this is one of the best games out there for that

hello friends i am recommending this game for you not because of steams treasure hunt but because my extensive playtime with this game that being a whole 39 minutes has made me realize this game is where you can play as a viking building the pyramids eiffel tower big ben stonehenge pentagon and just about everything you know how history really should have gone actually im not even sure if you can play as vikings but the idea of it is still neat i would like a sockpuppet civilzation but i guess they dont want me to create the perfect world history yet gotta keep something for the sequel eh anyway this is a game and stuff you should probably check into if you like games and if this particular type of game is specifically to your liking of specific games of this specific type oh holy bananas did you know theres a kangaroo standing behind you right now um you should probably do something about that i dont think a kangaroo is supposed to be in your room

sid meiers civilization v vainilla sucks hard but with both expansions its a pretty good game i suggest you to buy the whole thing or not buying it at all since without the expansions there will be no religion no espionage and the diplomacy will be pretty broken too making the game kind of unplayable three weak spots 1you can not found companies like in civilization iv beyond the sword 2edit warmongering is super tricky and difficult now 3the empire happiness system was improved a lot but its still illogical since every city should have his own level of happiness like in civilization iii or civilization iv you could have an empire happiness level system but it should be regulated from the individual level of happiness of every city lets say you have an empire with 2 cities lisboa and oporto if oporto is under siege its logical that the happiness of oporto drops and than that deteriorates its growth commerce and productivity but why should lisboa which is very far away from the warfront be upset about it lets be real every city has its own problems should there be factors that deteriorate the happiness of all cities yes like nuclear war declaring war against civilizations with the same idiology or religion but happiness should not be only global the fact that you build a circus in oporto does not make lisboa any better it makes no sense if lisboa is overpopulated let lisboa be upset and unhappy about it but its madness that because one overpopulated city the whole productivity of your empire drops said that this game is good stuff good graphics good combat system even better that civilization iv decent diplomacy no bugs at all very nice multiplayer all civilizations are good but england and france

i really like that part of oldest sitcom in history of game development  so guys just try and enjoy that stuff if u will play with friends u will find great timekiller and funny moments in that game  civilization v back us to classic hexagons rather than civ iv its first good sign 2 great multiplayer mode 3 great scenarios for lone wolves 4 extended settings for your own game 5 recommended by time  6 of course i love that soundtrack great work by composers 7 i think that game have balance all nations have own bonuses choice what u like and beat your opponents 8 for newbies  easy to learn omg its just civilization what i can say more and only one bad sign i can say about civ v  cropped release version because if you want religion  you will need to buy dlc gods & kings nobody like that marketing politic cheers mazy

civilization 5 simply put is one of the best strategy games on the market and the benchmark that all other turnbased strategy games are measured against players are given a fantastic array of civs to choose from queen elizabeth england napolean france bismarck germany caeser italy harun al rashid persia gandhiindia to name but a few polished graphics and gameplay deep technology and culture trees a multitude of victory tracks to include domination culture science and diplomatic victories civilizationspecific war units and equipment deeply satisfying combat broad customization options engaging multiplayer and a seemingly endless amount of replayability this is a musthave title for any pc gamer  highly recommended  [graphics 1010 gameplay 1010 sound 810 replay value 1010 multiplayer 910]  rated 1010

i am a fan of turn based strategy games i know a lot of people find these to be the antithesis of fun but for me i find the slower pace to be quite enjoyable it is just a blast to watch your civilization grow and finally envelope the world the game can be challenging but it is just so fun to watch your guys who have developed to the freaking space age tearing through the medieval armies of your foes it is one of those games that is difficult to stop playing i have played games from start to finish in one sitting those familiar with the title can tell you that can be a long while cannot recommend this game enough

recommended
just in case playtime recorded doesnt count as a recommendation on its own i ing recommend this game seriously do you like strategy games okay buy this we dont have anything else to talk about the expansions are well worth it too though if youre only going to pick up one id say grab brave new world if you can even get the second before the first i wouldnt know the trading system gives you a lot more to think about but its really the update to cultural victories with tourism museums and artifacts that make the expansion for me if you like nonaggressive play the changes are amazing there isnt quite as much to offer for you warmongers but moving resources around with the trade routes is still going to be important not to mention it added venice which is pretty much the only civ you will ever need to play as ever again the religion and espionage systems added in gods and kings are definitely fun but i felt both systems couldve been a little deeper i really wanted to set myself up as a sort of 16th century vatican city puppetmastertype civ but alas both systems are integrated in the changes to brave new world though and i found that worth it as well get them both dont even wait for a sale buy them all right this instant

historical strategy does not get any better than civ 5 allowing people to play an alternate version of history is great and sid and his peeps at firaxis hit the nail on the head with hours of replayability the game allows for a different story each time

freaking amazing best topview strategy game i ever played i love how you can control who is in the world and the difficulty level map type etc i felt like i was competing against real players when i was faced with the ai leaders in the game i actually checked to see if i was in multiplayer somehow by accident 1010

this game will consume your life 1010

dont trust gaundi
recommended
probably my favorite turn based games i have all the dlc and i never get bored its just hard to find the time to play a whole scenario through
recommended
with the expansions civilization v is one of the best strategy games ever made i cant recommend it highly enough
recommended
this is one of my favourite games of all time i will make a more detailed review in future but what i have to say now is buy it steven buy it you know you want to
recommended
you can play this game for 12 hours and still not finish
recommended
civilization v is as much a lateral step away from the complicated nature of civ iv as it is a step forward in the franchises vaunted history most importantly after 18 months civ 5 has improved dramatically from the game it was upon release the ai is improved key game concepts have been buffed and nerfed as needed and there is welcome but not critical dlc what i love about this version hexbased game board for more natural movement no more stacks of doom global happiness no tech trading drastically improved ai relations improved event notification system means you never miss a beat what i dislike the tech tree has been significantly flattened from civ 4 tech and culture victories are terribly boring to achieve hunker down press next turn repeat 200 times overreliance on gold farming to buy off all problems overall  a successful attempt to streamline gameplay without removing core elements civ 5 is a success and i welcome the coming expansions
recommended
this game is brilliant my pc isnt the best so i decided id give the demo a go it gives just enough to make you really want to see more i picked up the gold version of the game and had a lot of fun with that but i would really advise getting the brave new wolrd expansion too it adds great new systems to the game there isnt really anything else i can say that a go at the demo wouldnt say other than if you get this game get brave new world too
recommended
honestly yes i do reccomend it to any mmo board game fans or strategy players out there civ v is a timeeating game its a game you can casually playand check your emailsfacebook while playing but thatdoesnt mean the game isnt intense whenever i sit down to play a game of civ for a few minutes i end up spending my whole day building my civillization this game also has great tooltips and ui i mastered the game without the need of tutuorial but there areadvisoringame diologues that explain everything these can be disabled in all fairness i give this game a 85 out of 10 buy this game its worth every single penny
recommended
civilization v is a very fun strategy game you choose a country which you are the great leader of such as george washington for usa and elizabeth for england you try to build a strong civilization you can win five different ways using diplomacy using millitary using science using culture or just having your civilization have the highest score by 2050
recommended
this is a vast game with the highest replay value of any other i have ever played the differences among civilizations range from slim to huge and they all have a very unique style of gameplay put in the many factors that can be modified before a game session such as map size and resource abundance and youll find yourself living with this game for a long time big points for the soundtrack and graphics as well the ai is really well adjusted too compared to older versions of civilization it is now possible to actually stand a chance playing in the hardest settings and still feels rewarding if you lose and yet tried your best there is nothing left to say other than play this game oh and get the expansions too
recommended
fun game i usually play under a different account so not all my hours are logged here lots of replay value  games always feel different and theres no one way to win
recommended
this game is fun to play when your trying to burn time

recommended
great turn based strategy game
recommended
really addicting gameworth the money
recommended
this is definitely the culmination of the civilization franchise cant wait to go to space next but until then just one more turn
recommended
one of the best strategy games ive ever played so many hours have gone into this game its ridiculous highly recommend getting the expansion pack because it completes the game where the original falls short if youre a fan of turn based games this is a must
recommended
great turn based strategy game

with only a thousand pounds in my pocket i was just able to afford sid meierss civilization v and the gold edition and the dlc and the limited edition sid meierss keychain at first i was fairly sure that i had accidentally bought farming simulator 2014 but then i realised that they have not released that game yet the defining moment of this game was when i made an artillery cannon and blew up most of spain i dont have anything against people from spain i just think that their country is really hot and once i went there and asked for a glass of milk and was given a shot of vodka i was going to complain but the man behind the counter was really scary so i didnt my favourite sid meierss civilization v to play as is russia because it means i dont have to look at the russian lady who is not very pretty i think they could have stepped up their game and bit their lip and hired someone better because she is negatively portraying russians as ladys who dont have legs but instead have strange domes which need massive dresses to hide my verdict overall is ok but i think if sid meiers took care of his civilization he wouldnt have to keep replacing them
recommended
ruined my life 1010 also 287287
recommended
just in case playtime recorded doesnt count as a recommendation on its own i ing recommend this game seriously do you like strategy games okay buy this we dont have anything else to talk about the expansions are well worth it too though if youre only going to pick up one id say grab brave new world if you can even get the second before the first i wouldnt know the trading system gives you a lot more to think about but its really the update to cultural victories with tourism museums and artifacts that make the expansion for me if you like nonaggressive play the changes are amazing there isnt quite as much to offer for you warmongers but moving resources around with the trade routes is still going to be important not to mention it added venice which is pretty much the only civ you will ever need to play as ever again the religion and espionage systems added in gods and kings are definitely fun but i felt both systems couldve been a little deeper i really wanted to set myself up as a sort of 16th century vatican city puppetmastertype civ but alas both systems are integrated in the changes to brave new world though and i found that worth it as well get them both dont even wait for a sale buy them all right this instant

this is an awesome game
recommended
civilization v is one of the best turnbased strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player this is one game that any strategy enthusiast or hell anyone stratcurious should check out sure i miss some of the deeper intercivilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in civilization iv but thats nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about with all the tips advisers and tools in place this is the first civilization for pc that i feel is worth just about every persons time go forth and create subdue and exploit
recommended

its gettin hot in here so take of all yo clothes i won
recommended
ill keep this short and sweet i never played civ games for more than a few tries here and there over the years i never played the original one mind you but i played 24 i appreciate the genre i grew up on board games like risk so this is nothing new to me all that being said i now love civ it may have taken 5 games to get there but i am hooked i have spent many hours dominating the world i will spend many more again buy this you wont regret it
recommended
this is definitley one of the best strategy games ive ever played and the fact that its modable just makes it so much better i might be new to civ but if you love strategy get this game its worth every cent although if you want cuz its pretty expensive with the expansion packs then wait until there is a sale then you can buy the gold edition having an expansion pack adds so much to the gameplay either wait or buy now but once you do buy it well enjoy
recommended
the one game the best game 1010
recommended
civilization v is an immensely popular steam game and rightly so its just one more turn brilliance is down to lots of brilliant options to customise your game and an abudance of great mods to add for further customization no playthrough is ever the same i would recommend this game to anyone interested in history geography or just strategy games in general its realism is sufficient yet not so much as to be boring firstrate game in my opinion i would recommend that you buy the goldcomplete edition if you are serious about playing the game it gives you the nice dlcs that are really worth their money
recommended
for those that enjoy playing strategic warnonwar games will like this might not be as in depth like other stratergy games like europa universalis 4 but an enjoyable pass time
recommended
really fun and really addicting once you really get into it
recommended
a quick paced game at first as it progresses you must constantly adapt and change your stategem in order to survive
recommended
this  game  is  epic its complex at first but really fun
recommended
great game if you have time you could easily spend 48 hours straight on this game workshop support is fun though not all of the mods really work that well also seems to have optimization issues can run on almost any comp within the last few years on low but high seems to have trouble on even dedicated gaming comps also the more turns have passed the more time it takes for the cpus to take their turn like i would get over a minuite sometimes also the game isnt quite complete without the dlc sadly the dlc adds a great number of features fixes ect but should have been a free update you can however get it pretty cheap if you check the steam sales
recommended
amazing game not only does civ v rise up to the expectations of series it exceeeds themwhile the army stacking may be a small flaw other features including simplified diplomacy and improved interface make the issue almost nonexistant if you played a perivous issue of the series or are a fan of strategy in any sort pick up a copy of this game asap
recommended
this game will test your trust bonds with your friends
recommended
buy this and the brave new world expansion 710 civ v 910 civ v brave new world
recommended
this game is a mix of adrenaline and a mix of relaxation while you spread your culture religion or your power you can win the game by science domination culture and a few more but those are the most common and most enjoyable i personally love playing science and domination you get a nice mix of everything in those games and i mean come on war is fun and so is science from worrying about your happiness to keep revelation at bay to worrying about russia assembling units around your borders this game is sure to give you a gratifying and amazing experience many of which you will find yourself telling your friends about this game is addicting as hell you will find yourself slugging along at 4 in the morning justonemoreturn and so on the combat is brilliant the game is pretty balanced only a few issues with that but hard to notice and rare to come across and its a blast to play with friends and by yourself now if you are a civ4 player coming to 5 the new diplomacy will take some getting used to always and i mean always have a good defense or civs who are bigger and better than you will walk all over you to expand but if your military is a threat they will back off also your actions can affect your relations with the other civs if you were to make a proposal in the world congress a civ docent like it will make then very angry with you deepening on the proposal it could be a war on your hands overall the game is worth every penny and it one of my favorite games of all time a must have
recommended
this is an awesome game
recommended
rule 1 of civ 5 never trust agustus ceasar that dude make some good salad but he will murder you and everything you love
recommended
buy it just do it tis worth every penny from the hours of gameplay you gain from it
recommended
omg help me i cant stop playing holy  is good
recommended
i thoroughly recommend sid meiers civilization v as it provides literally hundreds of hours of captivating entertainment at the expense of a mere 40 earth dollars you can have endless fun attacking your not really best friends with nuclear weapons of mass destruction destroying all of their tiresome efforts in one fell swoop i dont recommend doing that last part too much as judging from personal experience it can tend to provoke suicidal thoughts in the victims mind other than that its pretty  and overpriced
recommended
tom clancys civilization v is a good stratagame
recommended
the words just one more turn have a different meaning in civ v  one day i wanted to do a fast and short matchit took 9 hours 1010
recommended
one of the best civ games out there i wont debate with you why i think its one of the best but i will concede that its has to be at least in the top 3 sid meier games i dont think i have to explain why i love civilization games i mean civ 1 came out in 1991 and sid meier has been making games since 1982 thanks wikipedia for having a sid meier page overall civilization games have been one of my favorite strategy games out there and i hope that the upcoming civilization beyond earth can anyone say alpha centauri is also a smashing success
recommended
great strategy although some glitches if you are running an extremely long game my friends and i hotseat alot on his computer and i finally bought it for solo play great game
recommended
if you want a game to eat your afternoons away this is the perfect game for you no other game has made me play it for 6 hours straight and not checking the time until after im done

a truly awesome and addictive game once you pick it up you cannot put it down and you cannot stop thinking about it when you take a little break from it one sunday morning i decided to play it once i finished up i realised my day was gone the game is somewhat slow but i hear its dlc brave new world speeds it up a bit i find no cons in this game 1010
recommended
just buy it its very good game cant stop playing
recommended
civ 3 was my first taste of the series and its been a journey watching this franchise grow each release is innovative and makes the game that much more fun to play civ 5 has been by far the best in my opinion i will be playing this game for a long time
recommended
ive whiled away many an hour playing every version of this game civ v has its detractors among those who want a highly detailed wargame along the lines of civ iv but i like its focus on immersion and versatility its still not the perfect version of the game it wants to be but brave new world is a giant leap toward that ideal the layers of possibilities for your civilization have never been so diverse and interesting all hail the king of turnbased strategy
recommended
its a great game and i can spend tons of hours on it creating different scenarios for myself
recommended
just one more turn before bed just one more man just one turn 6 hours later still playing civ 910
recommended
this game is like a gaben waifu 1110 would bang

quick review sid meiers civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played period i struggled to get into the medieval total war games however ive been playing the civilization games since i was twelveyearsold the game is rather expensive and to get all the achievements you need to get a fair amount of dlc i purchased civ5 gold edition so i was forced to also buy the brave new world dlc so fair warning if youre after everything expect the dlc trick detailed breakdown review story there are three main aspects to sid meiers civilization v 1 single player matches 2 single player scenarios 3 multiplayer matches as single player you may select from a list of nations to play as you may chose as rome greece germany the united states russia england and many others you play against other npcs you can choose your map size map style and other specialized options in the scenarios you are usually given a choice of nations that were in that scenario often times the scenarios are historic events such as the conquest of genghis khan 1066 conquest of england or the fall of rome lastly in multiplayer you can have a battle of wits against your friends you can play coop on the same computer or play online with your steam friends this mode is definitely an incentive for people whom are more competitive game play as ive elaborated already you can choose your country be sure to read the perks that country has certain countries are more effective at certain things some countries start out with special units others get bonuses from conquering barbarians and still others get great benefits from citystates the game has a lot to keep in mind while you play thankfully the game has advisors which help you get used to the game really fast they always pitch in their opinions and explain whats happening in the game are you an advanced player and tired of hearing them say the same things over and over no problem just disable them in the options menu in game you start with building your first city which becomes your capital and then you build armies settlers to build more cities workers buildings wonders and much much more achievements i wouldnt be consistent and true to my nature if i didnt add notes about achievements in my reviews lets face it many of the achievements in civ5 are a grind win as every nation play as every map size and type chop down 1000 tree tiles a lot of these achievements arent particularly interesting however i enjoyed them greatly and many people who might be looking to get away from grinding might prefer to avoid this game for the achievements alone many other achievements are very challenging to get at this time i havent started to work on getting deity the hardest difficulty achievements but many of those achievements are very difficult to get and often times require some tricks you pick up from playing price as i have already indicated expect this game to be rather pricy the vanilla original version of the game is $2999 if you are just looking to play a strategy game i think thats a fair price for the amount of time you can put into this game but to get more enjoyment out of your game the dlc does bring new scenarios new nations and new elements to the game that really makes the game just that more dynamic if you are looking for the whole set i would recommend buying the sid meiers civilization v complete edition its standard price is $4999 i would also recommend waiting for a price reduction either on christmas or the summer steam sale or keep your eyes open for a humble bundle sale conclusion while the game might be expensive i have personally put 219 hours into the game at this time for me thats the mark of a good game and having great replayability  if you enjoy playing it enough that you hit the 200 hours mark i have enjoyed the quality of the game the game style playing it with my friends and family and enjoyed getting the various achievements i highly recommend this game to anyone who has liked civilization games in the past and anyone who is looking for a strategy game to simply try out
recommended
i can be gaben lord of the pc master race i love the workshop other than that good game especially with the dlcs
recommended
one more turn
recommended
i made a giant death robot and then an unoriginal comment 1010
recommended
the geniuses game this game is all about strategy and patience its incredibly fun and will fill up all your free time it doesnt require a super computer but looks amazing this game is easy to pick up and learn and when you get better you can increase the difficulty the multiplayer is absolutely amazing and ive had hours of fun with it although it seems to take a while for the ai to do its turns in the higher rounds the community is making the game even better with thousands of mods hiding away in the workshop once youre done with all the standard stuff you can install extra mods and make the game even more enjoyable probably one of the best games ive ever owned 1010
recommended
since its release civilization 5 has gone through a long period of developement to reach the point where it is today if this were a review of the original game before the brave new world expansion then no there is no way i could honestly reccomend this game it was by no means a bad game beforehand it was just that it felt somewhat incomplete and it couldnt stand alongside sid meiers previous releases however looking at the game after brave new world was released and after it has been extensively updated sid meiers civilization 5 has truly become a game which just like its predecessors can stand the test of time as a somewhat more casual gamer due to my time constraints i really shouldnt like the civilization series but somehow i do manage to find the time to slot a few games in here and there but yeah i dont know what else to say about the game except that its ing amazing but you should get brave new world otherwise it kind of feels a bit incomplete
recommended
the city state or warshaw was more difficult to take over than the japanese empire ghandi uses nukes and george washington is one sly sob 1010
recommended
amazing a blast with friends conquering and crusading for your glorious nation and renaming every city something silly is one of the best things to happen to gaming 1010 would play again

i really like that part of oldest sitcom in history of game development  so guys just try and enjoy that stuff if u will play with friends u will find great timekiller and funny moments in that game  civilization v back us to classic hexagons rather than civ iv its first good sign 2 great multiplayer mode 3 great scenarios for lone wolves 4 extended settings for your own game 5 recommended by time  6 of course i love that soundtrack great work by composers 7 i think that game have balance all nations have own bonuses choice what u like and beat your opponents 8 for newbies  easy to learn omg its just civilization what i can say more and only one bad sign i can say about civ v  cropped release version because if you want religion  you will need to buy dlc gods & kings nobody like that marketing politic cheers mazy
recommended
great depth of play i still dont know what im doing
recommended
fun game to just play with friends could be taken seriously if youre that hardcore i guess
recommended
note this review is about civilization v complete edition i will not describe the gameplay very deeply i believe it was described many times in other reviews here on steam and on many game sites this game brings back the atmosphere that was in the good old rts like rise of nations or empire earth choose the civilization you wanto to play as then guide it from the ancient history to the near future you can win by conquer every capital city on the map if you are going to do that you probably will have to kill everything that stands in your way and conquer all the cities on the way as well however there are more victory conditions than just conquer and kill everything there are more peaceful ways to achieve victory you can spread your culture to other civilizations you can become a world leader or build a spacecraft and send it to aplha centauri thanks to this the game is not only for bloodthirsty warmongers but also for players who like to play as a peaceful lord its also more replayable another good point of civ v is the opportunity of taking history in your hands and change it what if zulu was the first nation who sent their spacecraft to alpha centauri does it hear ridiculous to you or what if napoleon didnt declared himself as the emperor of france but was elected as leader of the world instead do you say that its impossible not in this game this is what i miss in newer games the game is turn based so you dont have to hurry this makes the game relaxing what makes it even more relaxing is the soundtrack especially when you play as one of the middle east civilizations another thing that i like about games like this is the fact that you can learn something by just playing them civilopedia the ingame manual contains informations not only useful for the gameplay but also some historical facts the other way to learn something is to create the great works of arts they can be produces by great writers musicians and artists that are born in your empire they are named by real persons and the works they create really existed you can read excerpts from the books hear parts from the songs and look at the paintings sure you wont gain enough knowledge to teach at oxford university but it can raise an interest in you about these things well at least it did in me there werent many games with such an impact on me only age of empires ii and rome total war as far as i can remember i was able to lost myself while playing this game many times i told myself ok i will play this for a few minutes then i looked at the clock and thought well its pretty late i can fully recommend this game for anybody who likes to play strategies sir what will be it today we are going for the space victory james what civilization will you send to space my lord we will play as morocco after few days how is it going sir we are nearly done my dear james we have the most delegates in the world congress the other nations are waging wars against eachother what ideology have you chosen if i may ask you we are following the autocracy ideology pardon my my lord but i am not sure if autocracy is suitable for space victory maybe it isnt james but well get an achievement for it if we win oh i understand how much did you progress in your goal to win the science victory sir just a few turns and our spacecraft will be ready then we will send it to space and we will be the winners just a few turns

recommended
amazingly time wasting game
recommended
what is there to say about this game its great in strategy always allowing for choices on what kind of nation you want to lead with policies research diplomacy it would seem like there is always something new to discover something new to learn which is in any game awesome and something that makes games timeless and entertaining for a long time but you wouldnt need me to tell you that im hardly a strategy game pro besides being an awesome strategy game though this game also chose to have this message of showing you how awesome humanity is with quotes and cinematics just great stuff really makes ya feel optimistic d but all i can say is great game of all the games you need to buy on steam this one is one of the best classics that still holds up time and time again
recommended
note i played a lot more of this during the elongated time my internet was down sid meiers civ v is an awesome turn based stratergy game rich in content and only deepened by the vast collection of online mods gameplay is simple at first but surprisingly deep and addictive you pick a leader and you rule your country you start with only a few units and anciet technology but soon amass yourself with large armies and highly advanced mordern technology forging alliances with leaders is fun but the ai is rather idiotic at times and that can be troublesome but its only a small problem for such a well made game just one more turn
recommended
if there is one turnbyturn strategy game to own civilization is the one to go for the first episode was the game i spent more time on until i discovered mmos this vth episode is probably the best since then  complex detailed and with plenty of different civilisations a must have more words arent necessary

i i promise just one more turn and ill go to bed
recommended
its not like this game is so obscure that it actually needs a recommendation but i thought i would add one from the perspective of someone who has never played a civ game until 5 i grew up on pc games and could have easily played any of the previous versions but for some reason just felt this wasnt really my type of thing well it took 20 years or so but i can finally admit i was wrong its a really fun and extremely addicting game that said there is definitely a bit of a learning curve for newbies i really had no idea what i was doing at first but eventually it all gels and you start to see why the series has been so popular i have no idea how civ 5 compares to previous games but from personal experience i can at least confirm that its most definitely a good place to start for those new to the series if you are like me and was never really sure if civ was for you i say give this a try youll probably be addicted before you know it just one more turn 
recommended
one of the best strategies to date i keep coming back to it and killing some boredom its also a very good game to play with friends and you can play with many friends on the same computer with hotseat mode its really the best timekiller even tough it gets boring after long sessions or in late game i really really recommend it

if you enjoy building your armies for glorious desolation creating a nation of arts and music to shock the world to do your bidding or seeking victory through the subtle manipulation and underminging of those who are your lesser this game is for you a fully captivating experience that is different every time play how you see fit and allow your nation to rise or fall on your choices in short buy it

i am new to civ i never played the old ones only seen them played so im fresh to the series since i only recently acquired a pc capable of playing decent games civilization v is one of my favourite games in recent memory ive spent well over 100 hours playing it and i am not tired yet each race and location adds an exciting change and its fun to attempt a victory in the many different ways you can in this game but as i mentioned i feel the game is well worth the money you spend but i am also new to the series and have nothing to base this game on other than the fun i get from it and from my perspective this game is an instant classic

i have played this game for a long time and i still love playing it every time you start a game it is different and this game is great on your own but even better with friends i suggest buying this game will the dlc as it does improve the game and it completes it
recommended
civilization v is a must buy for any turnbased strategy gamers out there it allows you to grow a civilization of your choice through the ancient era all the way up to the information era if you can survive until then that is the vanilla game itself is decent but is lacking in some areas i highly recommend buying the complete edition which includes two major dlcs gods and kings and brave new world with some other small civilization and map dlcs

50 hours into your latest save all is going well only 3 leaders left gandhi caesar and washington you draft an end game plan in your mind you will make friends with gandhi for obvious reasons hes chill then procede to befriend caesar then you will take out washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior he must pay 20 turns later all is going to plan we are now on washingtons doorstep gandhi and caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation all we need to do is eliminate the pesky americans and ith all our military now on american soil this should not take long then after the swift invasion of america we will make a vote for world peace at the un in rome of course with our new found indian and roman brethren it is a sure win but all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start quickly they become louder and louder what is this you think to yourself a false alarm you shrug it off maybe caesae bombing a city state the game pauses gandhi appears on the screen with a sinister grin he shouts war in your face only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight the camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy the capital of your glorious nation you then hear a rumble just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine you realise it is too late you can only watch as the missle closes in as your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people then silence before what had just occurred had sunk in before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears suddenly countless stealth bombers appear seemingly out of no where soon the sky is blackened by planes the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains you faint from the shock of what is unfolding you awake shortly after gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire now with giant death robots making the most of his seemingly never ending turn as gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes whats left of your broken nation all you can do is weep your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn why oh why did you turn of autosave did it really speed your game up was it worth it ghandi is a complete  he acts like your friend but will nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself 1010

 played as arabia on a large earth map  started in europe with brasil below me  captured brasils capital city because it look nice  turtled half the game before finding out i was coming second  russia was first  the only one between me and victory  russia wiped out egypt and japan which were around kazakhstan  russia has a army 3 times the size of mine  russia has like 30 citys with 2000 gold per turn  russias capital is in the middle of those 30 citys  russia was sill ahead in tech  operation cold war was now in effect  allied with korea who was above turkey and city states near russia to use as a shields  sent 2 nukes along with a fleet of 15 ships across the world to get as close to the capital as possible  still wasnt close enough  russias finish half the space ship  sent xcom squads to the city states closest to the capital  attack  que skyrim music  sent ships into the sea of okhotsk  oh crap russia was prepared  was met with a blockade of nuclear submarines  but the nukes must go through  punched a hole in the blockade with my ships  my ships sinking left and right  sent the cruiser with the nukes as far in as possible  russias got 3 turn left on her last spaceship part  the range on the bombs is just close enough  fire the nukes  send in the xcom squads  captured russias capital  no ships made it out though their sacrifices will be honored  most intense battle i ever fought  one turn later and france wins a cultural victory  what the hell france great game 8510

i am the peaceful nation of the celts we shall be the nation of religion and of diplomacy this went well we ended up next to the babylonians and we expanded nicely in peace however i have always believed in dibs so i placed down glasgow onto the land between us to provide a little buffer they seemed annoyed by this a few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years but otherwise nothing too bad happened in order to spread our religion further because we were known for our confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster we begin to invest in boats soon we covered the oceans in missionaries inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies babylon was making friends with a local city state genoa however they were trying to spread zoroastrianism those heathens despite both our religions being known for their peace we passiveaggressively sent missionary and inquisitor to genoa over the course of about 700 years we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions those same warriors had been given spears now but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders i offer babylon some sugar for their spice they wanted my sugar iron coal and all of my money i then asked germany if they wanted sugar for spice they accepted north of me rome had begun a war with france due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade i found myself with a huge amount of money everytime france and rome made peace i knew that rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes so i bought i gifted many city states my religion and gold and then i bought gifted france and germany enough money to declare with with rome while they fought my spearmen now musketmen continued to glare with babylons and we continued our 1500 year religious passiveaggression over genoa they said i was spying on them i said i wouldnt when my spies returned i sent them back to babylon a squad of 5 great prophets charged into babylon converting left right and centre babylon complained i was being a bit aggressive i apologised i then sent more missionaries to babylon i had now found every single civilization we decided to have a united nations meeting in 1600ad i as the host gave everyone a single vote except myself i gave myself 16 due to my popularity i declared my religion to be the world religion every one opposed i listened to their opinions and then passed it anyway when rome got angry about this i then paid france to declare war again when babylon got angry i then paid rome to declare war on them my civilians were amazingly happy hugely more than any other place but because i was an emperor they declared me declis the terrible despite my universal healthcare happy citizens peaceful religion not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word my army consisted of mostly my friends my city states and my musketmen now great war infantry continued to glare at the babylonian great war infantry after 2000 years a great duty to my nation their descendants shall continue to frown at the babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall eventually we reached a grand united nations meeting i sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 city state friends and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side i said that the peoples confucian republican empire of scotland was the best nation in the world they all voted against me i smiled and then declared i won anyway democracy is overrated freedom of religion only applies to my religion i dont need to be stronger when im more popular and my people are probably more beautiful and if you dont like me ill pay your best friend to backstab you through this i came to understand american foreign policy so civilization is if nothing else an educational tool

well then the time has finally come to review what has occupied my life for the past months oh civ 5 how i underestimated you this past summmer when i saw your goty edition on steam how i was hesitant to buy you and thought your gameplay was boring if only i knew i bought this game out of pure review score which of course being a 90 i assumed was something special as many of the steam games that are bought during sales do it sat on my library quite some time while i was busy murdering teemos on the fields of justice when i finally got tired of that i decided to check this game out so i double clicked on the icon and went into the game with little to no prior knowledge of what lay in store ahead i booted up the tutorial grabbed my water and said well civ 5 do your worst i was greeted by a morgan freeman like voice telling me about america and its past along with some facts about george washington this narrator got me so pumped up the combination of music the epic dialouge the voice mother of god the voice i had so many goosebumps running over my body that i could hardly contain myself and then i did it i pressed begin your journey little did i know this would take me above and beyond what i believed was a true gaming experience it started out simple a settler and a warrior unit and some lady telling me to found a city i plop it down and start producing a monument moving my warrior around and reasearching pottery i found my neighbor soon after the incas and i was greeted by a stunning display screen with a great voice actor and interface soon enough i had made a declaration of friendship and one thing led to another and all i remember was me saying justonemoreturn i ended up playing the tutorial for 6 hours straight yes 6 hours on the tutorial and it was glorious i ended up panicking and  at the fact that i could not save my progress but i digress it was the tutorial after all nowadays i find myself using my spare hours to play this meth like game my grades were rekt my relationships were rekt my reading life was rekt my league career was rekt and my plans to play bioshock infinite were rekt all in all i give this game a 2010 and reccomend you pick it up now that it will be dirt cheap with the summer sale only and only if you would like to have some ghandi nuking you would you like to make a trade agreement with england cursing that damned jungle king monty and oh my god that wounder was one freaking turn away from being built i just wasted 25 days of production and only got a measly 100 gold saniadsufludsbasfjdsbfjsfdslfa filled afternoons then this is the game for you life status rekt   not rekt   tyrannosaurus rekt

alright so i just finished my first game of civ 5 i decided to play the babylonians my people settled along a river no doubt reminescent of the fertile crescent and situated in the middle of a jungle early on in the game it gave me the option for my first social policy when i was looking at them all i decided that a scientific people like the babylonians would have no interest to be bogged down by tradition or resort to superstitions or religions so that meant i would go down liberty or honor i always imagined the babylonians as a rather honorable people so i decided that i would go down the path of honor the game even rewarded me with the title of nebuchadnezzar ii the great okay great so i noticed that a few of my neighbors assyria persia and greece were expanding a bit aggressively towards me and encroaching upon my great peoples sovereign lands and areas to roam and i decided to put a stop to this using the might of the famed babylonian keshiks bestowed upon us by the benevolent citystate of ur i conquered and annexed their lands so that my people might know further glory around the year ad 1950 i was given the choice of an ideology while within the late industrial era i chose the ideology of order so that the many comrades that now lived under my banner could be more productive and efficient in their works we babylonians do not tolerate any tomfoolery amongst our working class the game went on until the year ad 3000 when i finally won a culture victory against the remaining nations of arabia the zulus and the moroccans morocco conquered the poor nation of the songhai and the world would forever know the great poetry and works of the honorable and orderly babylonians lead by captain nebuchadnezzar ii tldr its a pretty good game

this game is one of the most intricate games on steam before i go any further just because it is an intricate game doesnt mean it is an amazing game civ v is a strategy game that allows you to control nurture and grow your own civilization you compete against other civilizations computer controlled or player controlled for the strongest empire in the game the game gets this part spot on it allows you to make your empire any stlye you want whether military production tourism and many more it allows you to build anything significant that has been in history now when you look past all the creativeness and choice you have in the game youll find it very how do you say ordinary other than the realistic historical storyline that you follow and the option to choose what you want to build the game breaks down to a 2d tile scroller where you command your pieces to move attack build etc this is the main process of the game the game will allow you choices like what you want to discover whether archery of the wheel but in the end it doesnt matter what you choose because for the game to progress you must in the end choose both to discover and while you are allowed to choose what to build and who to attack it is so tedious to do these things you wont want to do them for instance if you want to attack the empire next to you first you must make some warriors which takes numerous turns then you must move the warrior piece to attack position which takes even more turns now to conquer the city next to you it takes 10 warriors see the dilemma by the time you conquer that city you will want to quit the game lay in your bed and think about your life decisions overall this games pros and cons balance themselves out only buy this game if its on sale

civilization v is an absolutely massive game the dlc gives you lots of stuff to play around with and i recommend that you get the complete edition with all of the dlcs but after you get bored of the official stuff or even before youre bored of the official stuff you can get mods if you dont know how expansive the mod community of civ v is then just check out the steam workshop for civ v thats only a small part of the mods available for civ v you just have to jump in and start playing

oh civilization v what a masterpiece you are most of you who are interested in this game probably dont know the series but sid meiers civilization dates back to the 1991 and has span a long time the second most recent was civilization iv a game most fans are calling a masterpiece with its advanced gameplay not fully broken diplomacy and a good mod community it was destined for greatness then this came a long civilization v is an amazing game youll be leading a civilization through all of human history and even the future looking at how your civilization progresses will you wage war and be a war mongler the world fears will you lead in science and be the first to launch to a diferent world will you have all of the world succumb to your civilizations greatness all of this is up to you you have full freedom of what you want to do within the game and it benefits from it since you can do whatever you want you end up with fun scenarios intensity and essentialy some very satisfying gameplay the visuals and the overall presentation is good as well you get a very good cultural appropiate soundtrack while youre playing as a specific civilization which is very neat the best is especially the ingame rendered diplomacy screens where you will stand face to face with the leader youre discussing with it is amazing the first time and its still awesome the 561th time the only thing im dissapointed with is the ai in the game they tend to either be passive or be downright agressive however there are mods fixing this and you can always play multiplayer againstwith other people which is a lot of fun in it self the basegame is already a worthwhile purchase but can you afford it id suggest getting gods and kings as well as brave new world both expansions add a lot to the vanilla game and i personally cant go back to the normal experience all in all this is a must buy for any strategy gamer whatever if ones casual or hardcore youll be spending a lot of fun reor just creating historic events get this game as soon as you can no doubt about it

an all around fantastic 4x rts game civilization v once it has the two major expansions gods & kings and brave new world is an amazingly engulfing game so much of it is designed to pull you in and keep you wishing to advance your empire one more turn winning the game can be completed multiple ways with large or small empires and on higher difficulties victory can be a mad dash to the finish combat is fun and offers enjoyment in outwitting your opponent or holding off large waves of enemies at a choke point the units are are crafted in high detail and each civilization plays a slightly different way letting you try a vast array of different strategies the game is not without its faults however the biggest of these issues is the ai which can be confusing or downright moronic additionally while the shift to tacticalstyled combat is a nice change of pace in the series the ai doesnt seem to grasp how to make the most of its units and can make obvious tactical blunders with startling regularity the games netcode and stability are also questionable at times once larger maps come into play but when it is working play is smooth and almost seamless from one turn to the next all in all an excellent game in a series full of wellmade games

just one more turn civ 5 plus both expansions is the best civilization to date in my opinion great user interface best tactical combat of the series fantastic looking graphics wise and most importantly very fun and addicting all eras now seem wonderfully fleshed out thanks to the expansions and the game now feels as complete as civ 4 did wth beyond the sword

a very complex game that has a slight curving point for noobs though it takes a while to master it it is still by all means my favorite game the things i like about it it has very fun scenarios such as the american civil war scramble for africa and the fall of rome to name a few there are a lot of countries to choose and master it takes true strategy you cant just build a city and say youll win you probably wont with that overconfidence a very good wide variety of maps too choose from the multiplayer is amazing except for the fact that if you go to war with another human player you have to play in sequential order the graphics are quite astonishing aswell the things i dislike about it there are no multiplayer scenarios  overall i give this game a 9510 please leave any critizism in the comments thanks d

i bang of this game i love quirky dialogue and getting bumed is also fun back to the game i love it with all my heart and it has almost infinite replayability and it has found a place in my eye and with add on packs such as gods and kings layers upon layers of pure golden gameplay see what i did there are added into the game i would recommend this to anyone who doesnt have any mental issue or is crazy in the head you know the head im talking about anyway its a great bangable game and it will stay in my steam library for ever and ever and i might do a jiggle with it

50 hours into your latest save all is going well only 3 leaders left gandhi caesar and washington you draft an end game plan in your mind you will make friends with gandhi for obvious reasons hes chill then procede to befriend caesar then you will take out washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior he must pay 20 turns later all is going to plan we are now on washingtons doorstep gandhi and caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation all we need to do is eliminate the pesky americans and ith all our military now on american soil this should not take long then after the swift invasion of america we will make a vote for world peace at the un in rome of course with our new found indian and roman brethren it is a sure win but all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start quickly they become louder and louder what is this you think to yourself a false alarm you shrug it off maybe caesae bombing a city state the game pauses gandhi appears on the screen with a sinister grin he shouts war in your face only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight the camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy the capital of your glorious nation you then hear a rumble just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine you realise it is too late you can only watch as the missle closes in as your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people then silence before what had just occurred had sunk in before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears suddenly countless stealth bombers appear seemingly out of no where soon the sky is blackened by planes the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains you faint from the shock of what is unfolding you awake shortly after gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire now with giant death robots making the most of his seemingly never ending turn as gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes whats left of your broken nation all you can do is weep your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn why oh why did you turn of autosave did it really speed your game up was it worth it ghandi is a complete  he acts like your friend but will nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself 1010

i am the peaceful nation of the celts we shall be the nation of religion and of diplomacy this went well we ended up next to the babylonians and we expanded nicely in peace however i have always believed in dibs so i placed down glasgow onto the land between us to provide a little buffer they seemed annoyed by this a few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years but otherwise nothing too bad happened in order to spread our religion further because we were known for our confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster we begin to invest in boats soon we covered the oceans in missionaries inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies babylon was making friends with a local city state genoa however they were trying to spread zoroastrianism those heathens despite both our religions being known for their peace we passiveaggressively sent missionary and inquisitor to genoa over the course of about 700 years we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions those same warriors had been given spears now but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders i offer babylon some sugar for their spice they wanted my sugar iron coal and all of my money i then asked germany if they wanted sugar for spice they accepted north of me rome had begun a war with france due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade i found myself with a huge amount of money everytime france and rome made peace i knew that rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes so i bought i gifted many city states my religion and gold and then i bought gifted france and germany enough money to declare with with rome while they fought my spearmen now musketmen continued to glare with babylons and we continued our 1500 year religious passiveaggression over genoa they said i was spying on them i said i wouldnt when my spies returned i sent them back to babylon a squad of 5 great prophets charged into babylon converting left right and centre babylon complained i was being a bit aggressive i apologised i then sent more missionaries to babylon i had now found every single civilization we decided to have a united nations meeting in 1600ad i as the host gave everyone a single vote except myself i gave myself 16 due to my popularity i declared my religion to be the world religion every one opposed i listened to their opinions and then passed it anyway when rome got angry about this i then paid france to declare war again when babylon got angry i then paid rome to declare war on them my civilians were amazingly happy hugely more than any other place but because i was an emperor they declared me declis the terrible despite my universal healthcare happy citizens peaceful religion not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word my army consisted of mostly my friends my city states and my musketmen now great war infantry continued to glare at the babylonian great war infantry after 2000 years a great duty to my nation their descendants shall continue to frown at the babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall eventually we reached a grand united nations meeting i sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 city state friends and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side i said that the peoples confucian republican empire of scotland was the best nation in the world they all voted against me i smiled and then declared i won anyway democracy is overrated freedom of religion only applies to my religion i dont need to be stronger when im more popular and my people are probably more beautiful and if you dont like me ill pay your best friend to backstab you through this i came to understand american foreign policy so civilization is if nothing else an educational tool

this game is addictive as hell if you will buy it you will spend the crazy amount of hours to play it just alone or with friends this is this type of game which you can play many many times and will be always different i have played only very old civ 2 which was amazing game but civ v is just must have for people who love the strategy games just buy it you wont regeret it

civilization v is the first game i played in the civilization series recommended by my friends the game slowly robs you of your time absorbing you into its gameplay until five hours have gone by and youve gone from trying to not be overrun by barbarians to blasting foreign cities with cannons while building the lourve brave new world made the midgame a lot more interesting and balanced and its fun finding which nations suit your play style burying your problems in gold researching faster than everyone else converting everyone to your religion etc in my first playthrough i was a militaristic japanese nation who nuked washington dc for some meta humor 1010

aquire christendom spread it to all and conquer the world by holly rights a laugh and a half

theres something about taking over tamriel with celestia as your long time ally then suddenly the penisface city states declare war on me time to break out the tsar bombs again
recommended
you should buy this computer game
recommended
it is a good game prepare to spend hours on one game but it is totally worth it
recommended
good game worth it stays true to the civ legacy while also innovating itself enjoying it a lot
recommended
this game was definitely worth the money a game without an ending it can be played for hours without end cant wait to buy the next game
recommended
by far my most played game on steam i have ruled the world many a time and i shall again many more times thanks to this amazing game
recommended
i would definitely have to say that i thoroughly enjoy civilization v civ 5 is up in my top ranked games and many reasons got it there one would be the fact that you can see your own civilization progress through the ages which i find to be a very interesting concept should i list all of the reasons in this review it would be a good 5 pages long so instead im just going to say that i highly recommend this game just make sure that you have the patience for it finally as im sure has been said in most reviews i would say that although this game is great like an actual empire it takes the collaboration of all of the components to work swimmingly that being said in simpler terms this game is only worth it with all of the dlc that is available for purchase it may be a sum of extra money for some but it will be worth it in the end if you are a bargain hunter though then wait until a huge sale such as the summer or winter sale and get the game with all of the dlc for less than the price of the game alone when its not on sale thats all from me so happy gaming
recommended
if you are looking for a relaxing turnbased high replay value time eating game then you have come to the right place just one more turn
recommended
pretty good buy it thats all
recommended
very good stratergy game one of the best ive ever played lots of variety and content 1010

sid meiers civilization v is a roundbased turnbased strategy 4x   explore expand exploit and exterminate game ill review and recommend this game together with its expansions as those dlcs add important things to the main gameplay making this game so outstanding good if you like games like crusader kings or the total war series you definitely should check this one out there are of course some minor to major differences you pick a leadercountry for a game and have to reach different goals for different victory conditions my formerly most played game on steam heres why  addictive as hell  high replay factor  you get so much game for your money  every countryleader has different strengths  youll be able to play against friends  lots of diplomacy and different victory conditions  it is so much fun to watch your empire grow  every game you start is quite different  with dlcs there is now religion and even more ways to win a game  many different characters with dlcs even more different characters  graphics are actually neat can look quite nice but does also run on older pcs i guess about the music some parts of the soundtrack are very nice and beautiful but after playing a long time they can get repetetive and annoying so its neither really bad nor good some small things do bother me  i guess this is a matter of taste but i think there are way to many achievements like 280 of em  the scenarios are quite boring  sometimes i feel like you should have more diplomacy options and sometims its annoying how fast another nation dislikes you but i guess this is somehow realistic   battle is really simple if you want a similar game with more focus on battlewar try the total war series eg medieval or rome 1 overall this game is giving you extremely many hours of gametime due to its addictive gameplay and i guess youll easily get plus 100 150 hours with this one rating 94100
recommended
mustbuy strategy game this game when it has all the dlcs is way too addicting and is a blast to play through your own alternate history its way too easy to spent 8 hours simply building up your own empire and then several more in a devestating war for more land only buy this game if it is with all the dlcs particularly brave new world because the dlcs add some great features that the base game missed just buy the complete edition really right now
recommended
its pretty good i like to take it out on the boat with me but there is no wifi out on the water if youre looking for a boat i would highly reccomend the 430 sports coupe it comes with the convenience of a walkthru windshield and sunroof standard
recommended
a fantastic strategy game where you can make your own civilisation and nuke all other civilisatons whilst renaming your cities to whatever you want
recommended
civilization gets mainstreamed less demanding in the micromanagement department but most of the changes make for more interesting gameplay culture and religion are now currencies you can expend  the former to unlock civic trees and the latter to buy improvements both are essentially proxies for miniperks that boost various resources espionage is now menu based and more efficient citystates add a new dynamic to diplomacy and warfare one unit per hex eliminates stacking and speeds up combat time overall different less tedious but not necessarily worse only truly egregious thing was the shameless milking of dlc
recommended
like excel and powerpoint combined but with better ui  illasera 8510 without dlcexpansions 1010 with dlcexpansions
recommended
dumb and hard takes forever for other people to move theyre dumb
recommended
good game really fun
recommended
a lackluster game on its own but with the gods & kings and brave new world dlcs its a game you can sink hours into and wonder where the time went the game with the 2 big dlcs goes on sale often pick it up
recommended
unfortunately not everyone in my country is as committed to nonviolence as i am  gandhi
recommended
highly addictive game recommended for all turnbased strategy fans
recommended
great game fun without dlc and dlc make it feel like a whole new game or a whole new world <pun
recommended
the best strategy game i have ever played great graphics gameplay and dlcs playable for hours on hours
recommended
great game way better than civ 4
recommended
i lost my life thanks to this game i can do nothing besides play civ 1010
recommended
be prepared to have a 12 hour gaming session set the game down for 46 months and then pick it up again for another halfday session this game is a good way to sink a ton of time but gets repetitive fairly fast
recommended
it is a fun game of strategy and can go any way you want
recommended
gandhi built a city just to try to steal silk away from me i dont like when someone tries to steal my silk 1110 would nuke him again
recommended
after being gifted this particular game i was sceptical as to whether or not i would enjoy playing it i do indeed enjoy strategy games but i also sometimes tire of them easily i am also not one to read instructions and for a complex game such as this i imagined it would hinder me at first if i didnt read about the mechanics however i decided to just dive in and see how well i could do to begin to understand how it functions i havent played a lot of this game but i have played enough to understand how it works and how to role out different units it is particularly fun and entertaining but borderline addictive  thus my recommendation is to buy this game unless you feel that you will fall into a time sink wherein the only light you will see is from the burning fire and destruction in the massacre of other civilizations you plunder and ruin in your wake
recommended
one of the better games that i have played after you get started in a game the just one more turn mentality is insanely addicting i highly recomend this game even if you are new the turn based strategy genre
recommended
wasted hundreds of hours of my life and university time 1010
recommended
awesome game cant wait for civ beyond earth
recommended
one of the most addicting games ive ever played in depth enough that it takes some work but simple enough that it isnt cumbersome 1010 would play again
recommended
really good game
recommended
this game is great nice graphics and sounds the new combat system is very nice no more stacking plenty of units on the same tile must have if you like turn based strategy games my favourite is still civilization iii but its getting out now with 43 ratio resolution 910
recommended
civilization vs appeal comes from its rather humorous and endlessly entertaining historical scenarios and simpletograsp mechanics that allow any casual strategy game enthusiast to sink their teeth into ive sunk hours upon hours into this game because of it and i keep coming back for just one more turn of this long but incredibly enticing game give it a shot no matter what game genre you like its for everyone
recommended
beautimus gameplay that does last eternity but an enjoyable eternity definitly worth getting during a sale as the expansions are required imo for a balanced gameplay
recommended
best game in my libary 1010 fun strategic and addictive that may just be me would recomend to aney strategy or citybuilder fan
recommended
i love this game civ v is one of my favorite games of all time beating out some really great games its addictive and fun you just really get lost in the world i seriously do suggest though getting the complete edition dont waste your money on the base version and try and buy the expansions later just shell out the extra $30 $5 now during the weekend deal i highly recommend this game i have had a lot of fun in the time ive played it and i cant wait to play more 910
recommended
yeah its just one of those games that you can play for 659 hours swag
recommended
one more turn warning civilization v is highly addictive ive been playing civilization v since it was launched many years ago the game is excellent hard to write a proper review if you have already played any civilization game youll feel basically at home with this one there are a lot of nice new features like  the hex grid instead of the old square one  units cannot be placed on the same tile anymore so you have to find a new battle strategy now  citystates which are independent small nations which also offer new strategy for the longtime games if you are new to the series this an excellent but very complex game you have a lot of variables to care different victory types better with the latest expansion you can destroy every other nation build the most advanced technology possible or even be a diplomat who conquers the game by the other nationss votes my advice for you is start from the beginning play easy games to get into the rules and progressively increase the difficult as you understand the game better and better final advice if youre planning to buy get the completeuniversaldont know what they call edition with both expansions they add a lot to the game for a really nice price
recommended
over a days worth of gameplay and still not even close to bored amazingly addictive game
recommended
probably the best bang for your buck as far as replayability you want to go outside again stay away
recommended
epic game and many different scenarios 
recommended
i think this game is very good for new civ players
recommended
ignored my girlfriend for a week to play this im single now 2010
recommended
buy this quit drugs most addictive game i have ever played absoluetly the best strategy game out there 1010
recommended
with the brave new world expansion it became the best civ game to date i cant stop playing it one more turn damn its 7 am in the morning
recommended
are you serious  you need a review for civilization v andor expansions  you had to spend all your life living under a rock just go buy and play it if you didn`t already yes  it is awesome just never ever play it for a while before you will go to sleep it will not going to happen until your wifefiance will come and slap you just one more turn syndrome is strong in it i double dare you 
recommended

recommended
crack
recommended
frozr highly recommend it
recommended
if your looking for a review of civ v just get it how have you played video games and never gotten this series
recommended
one of the best turnbased strategy games ever basically unlimited replayibility especially with every games length and production trees
recommended
with both expansions this game rivals all other civilizations a solid 1010
recommended
very damn fun strategy game though it would be better if the multiplayer ai werent 
recommended
every game is different thats why i enjoy this game so much
recommended
its civ v so naturally its awesome nuff said
recommended
i enjoy playing this game however i wouldnt rate myself as a serious player for it i like that you can attack other players however i prefer much smaller games as opposed to large games as unfortunately i get bored after a while im much more of a skyrim girl good game though and my husband loves it he can play it for hours
recommended
civ 5 is a game which there is much fun to be had you can easily get 70 hours with this game 1010 must buy
recommended
ignore all the griping you hear about civ 5 being dumbed down or too different from civ 4 its still a great strategy game and with the gods and kings expansion just around the corner its going to get even better
recommended
civ 810 this game takes so much time off your day and it is still so much fun even though you just sit there and use one hand just like watching adult filmsone game takes hours and that is when your settings are on quick mode well i am not really sure i am a casual gamer not really competitive fun with friends it is always so much fun building your own empire whether you overpower your enemy or just simply build a utopia for your people and win through peace the game is awesome ps just press next turn already
recommended
genghis we could have ruled the world
recommended
normally id start this review off by saying something like if youre into strategy games this is a must buy but ironically i myself am not a big fan of strategy games so i think it speaks volumes to the entertainment value of this game when i have logged over 600 hours into civ v yet dont identify myself as a lover of the turn based strategy genre if you can grab this for a good price its absolutely a must buy
recommended
ok i started to play this game had no idea what i was doing but after about 3min i had a army starting a farm 2 kingdoms and a alance with a fellowship other kingdom and i started to get into it before i new it 5min turned into 1 12 hrs and i still wasent boardd i would recomend this game if you like stratagy and tower defence type games 
recommended
very addicting game really intense and i reccomend people buying this game
recommended
1010 would trade pearls for uranium again
recommended
made hentai a religion 5 stars
recommended
i would write a review for this but too busy playing maybe in another turn
recommended
oh ill just finish this turn 5 hours later youre still thinking the same thing
recommended
built rome in a day 1010
recommended
ghandi pointed a nuke at me and told me to rate this game good 1010 would nuke again
recommended
if youve never played a civilization game before expect the learning curve to be a brick wall you may be a seasoned gamer whos used to playing on normal or hard on other games right from the getgo but if you are brand new to this series play on super easy mode first to learn and experiment before trying harder difficult levels that said once youve learned the basics of the game and are ready for more challenging experiences you will be greatly rewarded games typically last between 1 and 12 hours depending on the type of victory you seek and the pace you set in the beginning and you will never have the same experience twice giving this game a massive replay value there are always new maps to play on new allies to make new choices that will decide the games outcome and new diplomatic challenges to face civ v does a great job of landing you into a new game and you always feel satisfied by the games end even if you lose that by itself always leaves you wanting to play more even if you somehow get bored of playing in singleplayer vanilla mode multiplayer is offered and there are a plethora of mods out there to try so if youre patient and willing to learn i highly recommend this game and its expansion packs
recommended
truly a great game relatively slow paced at times but so full of content especially with the expansions brave new world  gods and kings
recommended
just look at how many hours ive spend playing it
recommended
i had to uninstall this game to keep miself from playing it
recommended
       total war                                    
recommended
to me this game is fun i can go for hours on end sometimes playin this game not the best at it but there are so many options and goals there are like 5 ways you can win for s sake you can spread religion gain culture science and a bunch of other  its ing awesome especially with the workshop it has huuuuge potential only beat 1 game in 20 hours but its definitly a great time consumer were u to play on your plane flight i will never do online as that  would take days but still good game if you like long matches with tons of options probably the most changable game with workshop on steam
recommended
1010 would bang
recommended
fun game multiplayer works fine 1010
recommended
it had its flaws when it first came out mainly that it lacked depth and detail compared to civ iv but like all civ games they grow and grow and become more fun as time progresses i feel at this point actually since g&k expansion hit that civ v is beyond any other civ in the past and it makes it very dificult if not impossible to play previous titles again
recommended
472 hours in and the game is still as dynamic and engaging as ever
recommended
good game its a lot like skyrim but with guns

every game is different thats why i enjoy this game so much

great for a bigger lan with your friends there is no stopping mid game you play it all in one session got it you think you can just stop the game and socialize with people no the game eats you whole without a warning
recommended
great strategy game with an easymedium learning curve
recommended
this game has eaten too much of my time you can start a game at 5pm play for what seems like an hour then check the time and have it at 2am highly addictive and amazingly well put together this is a must for all game strategists library
recommended
you never get tired of this game due to the large ammount of civs and downloadable content from the steam workshop it is always fun to play alone and even with friends
recommended
when played with all the expansions and dlcs quite simply the best pc game ever at least in my opinion
recommended
i have a very soft spot for the civilization series civilization iii is to my memory the first game i ever played i have since played 2 the snes version of the original and this like the rest of the series its decently polished easy to learn has a lot of depth and is periliously addictive i didnt get into it as much as i did iii but thats probably just nostalgic bias if i had to complain i would say that the diploacy is rather limited and not being able to trade communications blows thankfully the rest of the game does it also i nuked beijing eleven times in a row and it still stood with two citzens who refused to die district 13 style 1110

sid meiers civilization v is a god among games if you dont get it you are mentally 
recommended
ive been saying to myself this is the last turn i swear but im just not able to quit these are the problems that show up as soon as you begin understanding the fundementals of this game sid meiers civlization v is a turnbased 4x game where you manage you cities and make sure your people are well fed and happy the goal in this game is to be the most progressive population on the planet you start out with a city that fits the population youve chosen from here on out you start exploring and building things with the first unit you will find things like ruins and barbarian camps the barbarians are your first real enemy you will have to try to fight them off while progressing your first city when you start expanding alot you find out that the barbarians are not a real threat anymore in fact you will be alot more busy with the other populations on the map the other populations can be friendly but also an enemy this is where diplomacy comes in some leaders of the populations may trick you and create traps to backstab you after a while so you have to be carefull on what you decide whats best you also get to trade and discuss with these leaders for instance you could trade a luxury that your population wishes for after a couple of hundered turns youll get the hang of it and start liking the game alot for me its the progressing that makes me hooked to this game its the mentality of just finishing this one thing that makes it soo addicting to me i find it to be one of the best games i have every played this is the first civilization game i ever played but now i regret that i never played the previous parts of this series all in all a great game i highly recommend it
recommended
its alright

if i had to choose between this or satisfying my heroin addiction i would choose this

i have never spent so much time on a game only to work towards being more angry still angry still playing
recommended
i love this game its very realistic allows you to change history with each action in each time period or stick to the books on what really happened in the past the various ways to win the game gives a lot of choice in how you want to become the greatest civilization in history there are a ton of mods that add many new ways to play aqnd win also you can invite friends and have massive battles or simply be peaceful with more then 10 players overall this game is amazing and is 5 out of 5
recommended
this game sucks because there are not enough explosions and im bad at it 15 bananas

i cried at the end 1010 would civ
recommended
ive played all the civ games and this is my favorite
recommended
this game is simply amazing
recommended
i love opening this game to play it i do it every 20 minutes doing my absolute best to shy away from vulgarity this game crashes harder than the challenger and bigger than the titanic and far more often the game becomes increasingly unstable as you play crash after crash until you have to reboot the entire computer just to enjoy a single turn of play again it also has truly bothersome glitches that cause dedicated units set to work tasks or to travel from point a to point b to just forget what they were doing entirely i do not run this on a laptop or a toaster either it does this on optimized specs now let me tell you why you should buy it anyway the big frustration of this game is that it really is just that fun when you crash out and lose a lot of time and effort just save your game before ending every single turn every turn i mean it it makes you all the madder because playing and accomplishing is so fun in this installment of civ id say its probably the best one yet and i really got a feel for it lightning fast pro job other than what i assume to be the coding

recommended
why are you reading reviews just go buy this game ya dingus the metascore for civilization v is completely accurate everyone deserves to experience this game in all its glory although it is a complicated turnbased strategy game the developers have truly smoothed the flow of gameplay turnbased strat games of the past personal example total war series have had a very realistic vibe and impressive gameplay but the learning curve was a little too much for me to actually enjoy it started feeling like a worldweary president the civ series has found the perfect inbetween this game is as complicated or as simple as you wish to make it and that type of customization promises hours of joy i never tire of starting a brand new game from scratch as the maps and resources change every time every playthrough is a new experience youll love it this game is a true work of art
recommended
fantastic game lose hours playing it
recommended
great game have learned all those famous leaders of society 
recommended
get it you wont be disappointed
recommended
an amazing game if you like strategy games has plenty of gameplay can keep you hooked for literally hundreds of hours and since the strategy is turn based you have no rush to play moves off quickly like an rts but still wished it ran a bit faster and the loading time is a bit long but otherwise a great game 1010 would bang i mean buy
recommended
amazing game i was reluctant at first saw it popup a bunch of times in reviews but i couldnt understand why people like it so much from the screenshots it seemed like a simple tabletop game boy was i wrong this game will keep you playing and playing for hours just one more turn just one more turn ps dont expect to finish a game in one go games tend to last for days
recommended
with all the expansions civ v is an extremely well executed strategic game true to its root full of content and endlessly replayable with friends had quite a few hiccups in multiplayer but now they are largely fixed steep price to get with all the dlc but well worth it
recommended
in four words  best of a kind totally recommend it
recommended
great great great great game just like buy it its best strategy
recommended
i think it is the best iteration of the civilization franchise yet letting no more than one combat unit occupy a space expands the tactcal strategy of the game a must by and excellent expansions
recommended
sid meiers civ 5 is the latest forray into civilization building from this acclaimed series it is also the first in the series that i have played so my review of the game is unbiased by the previous installments many have said that civ 3 is the best or that civ 4 is the only one to play but ive found that civ 5 is an excellent game that stands quite easily on its own merits and is definitely worth a play by anyone that enjoys a long drawn out turn based civilization management game pros wonderfully polished many civilizations to choose from great music extremely variable gameplay cons some dx bugs resource intensive laptops tend to lag might spend too much time playing this game a relaxing game that you can dump hours into this is one of the best multiplayer games that ive had the joy of playing and singleplayer is also a blast the expansion gods and kings while expensive is totally worth purchasing the other dlc is good but since theres so much of it wait for a sale a

could have sworn i did osmething liek this before ever wanted to take the reigns and manage your own nation well now you can  take command of prestigious nations like the usa great britian japan china russia germany and much more and contrcut cities even rename them if youd like and bound your nation forward through the starting era of your choosingbe fro mthe ancient era or even disregarding that and just starting in the future era with all technology unlocked you can negotiate with other nations through trade agreemnets research partnerships and much more your peopel giving you trouble with belly aching or is your nation incapable of producing that little osmething you want go talk to a discovered civilizatio nand see if they have it up for trade  i recommend this game to those who have always dreamed of commanding their own nations give it a try
recommended
this game is one of my favorites out of all the games i have this game provides countless hours of playing time with out getting repeating its self if you like strageyturn based games so if your into these types of games then definitley get it
recommended
been playing civ since the first one in the dos days genuinely thought this game was rubbish when i first started and preferred to play civ4 picked up both the expansions which changed my mind gk fixes the game and makes it playable and bnw is an improvement on that so yeah good game as long as you have at least gk
recommended
i recently got this game i was expecting myself to never get the hang of it but holy jesus i really cant stop playing its impossible to stop i got the hang of it perfectly in at least 4 hours which is very good to understand every little thing thats in the game its the first time ive ever played the franchise and its good i popped in at this stage in the franchise might i add the best part of the game is going past 2013 d 1010
recommended
filled to the brim with strategy this game is a must have i highly recommend the brave new world expansion i found it far more entertaining than the vanilla game
recommended
this is a really fun game that you just have to own i love all the dlc and its an amazing game dont question it just buy it
recommended
ah civv the game you dont multiplayer with anyone you like or youll never speak to each other again when i first played civv i wasnt sure what to think about it civ5 founded an entire genre its not the best in the genre my friends inform me that is galactic civilizations ii but its the bread and butter civ5 is the best introduction to strategy games avaliable most of what the game offers doesnt appeal to me personally the multiplayer has some bugs and i wasnt joking when i said the game ruins relationships my boyfriend didnt talk to me for a day after our first match i dont enjoy the idea of several weeks of playing the same game and it strikes me as tedious personally thats just my personal preferences though the game its good and worth giving a try if youre interested civ5 is the best one so far i do recommend getting the brave new world and the gods & kings dlc if you decide to however they really add a lot to the game and flesh out some of its weaker aspects
recommended
this game is awesome and diverse its very lengthy to complete a session
recommended
a wonderful game that you can get lost in
recommended
without any of the addon packages civ v is still a decent game but somewhat of a sidegrade from civ iv add gods and kings and brave new world however and you have yourself a heck of a game thats very rich in content very deep in gameplay and very very addictive my complaints are few namely i wish the barbarian levels were adjustable theyll wreck your civ in multiplayer and i wish multiplayer were a bit less buggy however these are minor compared to all the amazing gameplay
recommended
awesome game very easy to play i dived into a game and it was fantastic
recommended
this game is very fun it is stratigy based and provides loads of game play d

i really really really like this game my friends forced me to play starcraft ii it was good but i thought it should go slower and this is more relaxing so its perfekt
recommended
its a really good game without and addons its an even better game with just gods and kings its an amazing game with a brave new world i reccomend it for single player and i especially reccomend it if you want to have a fun game with friends or even a bloody war its a game filled with alliances betrayals and most of all barbarians i definitely reccomend it
recommended
dont play this game before you go to bed
recommended
great game its very fun planning attacks on places and i love the multiplayer 5 out of 5 stars
recommended
i played quite a bit in lan so far in coop mod against ais its alot of fun and quite addictive and well you tell yourself after lunch ok lets play half an hour then you look outside after 15 minutes and its getting dark well you get the picture i guess i  we are gonna train a little more vs the ai taking over the entire map and then do the same in online mp yeeeeaaaa right p on a slight downside though your view constantly jumps around to units needing orders or your allies battles this can get very frustrating after a while since you can not do anything while the battle is going on either there are ways to stop this from happening but often this causes the nice battle animations to not show at all i have not looked at anything from the modders community perhaps they got a solution anyhow the game is an overall very awsome experience

never have i ever not even once had a session of this game that was not a complete blast what cant be said about civ v its the peak of gridded strategy games not only will you have to plan out what direction you want your civilization to go in terms of how cultured scientific wealthy and happiness youll also have to keep track of the plots and connections of various citystates and of course other civilizations you can play a plethora of leaders to be the ruler of your civ each leader is unique and different to play however they are all fun to play theres no real bad or op leader the real fun of civ v is the mulitplayer whether you hop on a public server or have a match with your friends civilization will have you laughing sweating cheering crying and swearing from a player with 60 hours and no completed games i <3 this game
recommended
best global strategy youll never find anything better in this genre
recommended
what makes this game is the expansions they add lots of content and make the game more enjoyable with this game you can play as caeser in 2024 sending a nuke to the warmongering ghandi if you like historical accuracyplausability you may be shocked by this if you like absurdity and grandness but want a challenge youll like this if your new to grand strategy game this is a good starter as the ui is laid out well and very easy to access a good game can last for 12 hours from start to finish i have to force myself not to click the one more turn button
recommended
great game good graphics i would recommend this game
recommended
you wont be able to just have one more turn you fool
recommended
civilization 5 is addicting and fun
recommended
well worth the money long gameplay and obviously great replayability
recommended
great game
recommended
awesome i love the series and this is an excellent addition a must buy
recommended
as a new time gamer i really enjoy this game there is definitely a lot of strategy required in making sure your civilization is victorious i cant wait to delve deeper into the game and experience more of the strategy
recommended
its damn good and it is at its best when played multiplayer with close friends ^_^
recommended
one of the best time wasters i have ever played can easily zap away the day one of the main reason i try not to play it too much as i have too many games to catch up on endless space is almost like this game just in space and a steeper learning curve that sucks up alot of time if you love strategy games andor turn based games i highly reccomend this game to you watch these hilarious civilization commericials httpwwwyoutubecomwatchv_ojpzokafu then my favorite for the fourth game httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvkrnsv69_tmg
recommended
ive been playing civ since civ 1 on my 286 and this is the best in the series
recommended
awesome game but a super time sink
recommended
the most addictive game i ever playedfirst week18 hours of gameplay because its that addictive all people get it
recommended
amazing and addictive game a must buy
recommended
ever wondered what the world would be like if the shoshone tribes had tanks and machine guns to battle some samurais or if ghandi was held prisoner by genghis khan and after many centuries of captivity india was saved by the irish civ v is a very well furnished strategy game where the smallest quarell over some truffles can cause heinous wars building trading invadingevading civ v is all about those stuffs some drawbacks though it is a real time consummer also the game is less meaningfull not complete without gods & kings and a brave new world two extensions that make this game a killer so prepare your settlers and equip yourself with some fine diplomacy and strategy with numerous and technically more advanced troups on the side just in case
recommended
fun game a strategy with a turn based system gamers that enjoy slower pace should go for this game 810
recommended
very awesome strategy game a must have for anyone

great game with hours upon hours of game play best played with friends and voice chat so you can talk while planning wars etc nothing beats watching a friend try to invade an entire continent with just cannons
recommended
great game
recommended
lost countless hours to this game would reccomend
recommended
by far one of the greatest strategy games of all time the addictive nature of civ is in its unique ability to completely invest you into the civilization you create and grow through violent conquest or peaceful cunning the games near infinite number of ways to be played adds a replayability unrivaled by any game before it save some modern fpss as one of my top 5 games of all time i cannot recommend this game enough
recommended
this game ruins friendships 1010

this is the greatest game ever if you can develop a strategy to play you will not stop playing i play this and i cannot get bored their is no op things that can ruin the game even unique abilities that are called op have a small downside that if exploited is perfect i cannot think of any gaem breaking mechanic that will destroy it any time to come please buy this game and maybe i may be competing against you to build an empire that will stand the test of time another side not is that you will need to buy the expansions as they are worth it and are brilliant i brought them then couldnt go back to playing without them
recommended
this is a great game for strategy lovers and is even better when played multiplayer

recommended
definately worth the money when played with both the available addons
recommended
honestly id go for the complete edition for this game you get way more stuff for $2000 more it sounds like 100 times more money but its a realy great deal
recommended
i have owned civ v now for almost two years and it has always been nothing but awesome even more awesome now with the brave new world dlc and the addition of religion spies congress tourism trade routes etc this has made the game even more interesting i lose track of hours on this building my economy while trying to build my army and not breaking the bank in the process watching other civilizations machinations with my spies and increasing border expansion to an alltime high without  off my neighbors it is indeed very complex and i am always learning new tips and tricks besides skyrim this is most definitely my favorite game on steam i give it 1010 cupcakes
recommended
when using raid foam to kill an ant colony outside of my house as im spraying i pictured in my mind how the ants would deal with the fog of war and then went to play civ 5

this game is great to play with your friends but take ages so be prepared to spend a long time on this game

recommended
sid meiers civilization v this game is the absolute best as far as realistic strategy games go the amount of depth they have put into the mechanics is mind boggling i will warn though that historical documentaries will never be the same for you after this game i cant tell you how many times i have been watching something on wwii and found my self pulling apart and analysing their strategies and in some cases implementing them into my own gameplay strategies
recommended
i used to really enjoy games like this when i was little and since then ive moved into firstthird person shooters a big change for me so when a friend recommended the game i was likeehhh but it was already sitting in my library as i think it was gifted to me awhile back decided to install it and give it a go at first i felt like it was going to be too much theres so much to click onread ahhhh what do i do but wasnt very long till i was getting comfortable with what was going on i just took the time to hover over each button to see what did what the games tips that pop up arent annoying and provide just enough info for you its been quite fun starting cities building armies creating natural wonders great civs being born in my settlements making farms and minesgood stuff the music has been quite enjoyable as well i definitely recommend this game and this is from a gamer thats been playing nothing but tf2 call of duty loadout battlefield etc for the most part the last 7 years
recommended
this game eats up my whole life i have stockholm syndrome for civ v
recommended
alot of fun cant wait for the next one
recommended
best game ever you are missing out if you dont have it dont be fooled by the price it is worth it
recommended
i can get lost in this game hold onwhere im i holy moly where the hell am i
recommended
amazing game that consumes time
recommended
one of my all time fav games this requires you to have a stong economy while ballencing other aspects of your empire on multuple fronts not only is this game diplomaticaly focoused it also has extreme focous for combat and war situations aswell for example your units gain a bonous for attacking from a hill and can often not attack with indirect fire if i had to make one complant i would say that some of the civs need a little reballancing other then that if you are a stratigist then you need to pick this game up 9510
recommended
the best way to get rid of few days a week or even a winter be careful though

recommended
this is my first civ game and let me just say that its made a great impression me and my friend just havent stoped playing dominating whole countries and having your whole empire crumble from one mistake this game is a must have the multiplayer is also a wonderful and fun time just make sure you bring friends and a glass of water cause things can get stressful 1010
recommended
i was in another country couldnt find my friends i was alone 5 years alone alone10 like skyrim whit no friends machinima
recommended
its really good despite it being a turn type of game it is very fun and addicting to play <3 especially with friends
recommended
in my opinion this game has limited replayability and no challenge to it as i beat deity within a few hours i certainly am not the kind of person to keep playing this for hours on end in order to shove a nuke right up gandhis  because he is a massive  overall 010 1010 in reality i live for this game
recommended
right after i bought this damn game it went back down price son of a gun
recommended
it is the best freaking game ever 700 hours played 800 and beond
recommended
this game ate away my life 10 whoopi goldbergs

recommended
ghandi stole everything from me i attempted to please him with my gold and resources in return for mercy and peace it was not enough however after his conquests in america and mongolia ghandis bloodlust targeted my puny pathetic civilization he nuked all of my cities and razed all those who survived his giant death robots marched towards my capitol as i pleaded the great one to spare me he simply laughed and pillaged all the remaining land i had with my people starving and unhappy i had no choice but to vote for ghandi as world leader in the united nations in exchange for oranges gg ghandi gg 1010
recommended
an amazing game i reccomend it to players that like a challenging game even though it might take a while to get into and the games may be long still a fun strategy game to play
recommended
its a good game why it takes away 3 gb free space from your hard drive it makes you experience feelings youve never experienced before as you watch the city you spend 9 hours building gets destroyed by enemy forces what real life is that a server you can get nuked by ghandi you can nuke ghandi back so overall great game should play it
recommended
awesome to play with few people but only if you can afford to buy all expantions if not then simply buy one of previous parts
recommended
historical figures controlling countries and living for thousands of years with nukes and giant robots from the future 1010
recommended
best game on steam
recommended
this is a good starter to get into the strategy based games its enjoyable and will suck up allot of your time without you realising it i dont feel that the addon packs are all that worth it though what is included with the game is more then enough
recommended
civ v is potentially the refresh of this monumental frachise its practically your beloved civ on a hex grid with a modern resculpting of the classic game mechanics its just as addictive  one more turn youll find yourself thinking the pinnacle of a genre defining game
recommended
this is my favorite star wars sequel
recommended
by far one of the best games that i have ever played with the addition to the expansion packs this game has created much more depth and gameplay the various ways to win now is incredible and starting a new game is bound to kill 5 hours without realizing it thumbs up
recommended
do not play this game seriously its so awful if you value your time you cant play this its just too god dam amazing never ever ever play this game the one more turnturns into one more hour then one more afternoon stay away
recommended
ruining my life 1010
recommended
the best turnbased strategy game i played they keep updating the game with large dlcs it costs money but that makes the game durable you never played a turnbased strategy game before well civilization 5 is a lot easier to play than the civilizaition games before just try it its awesome
recommended
france is an

whenever i play this game i cant stop maybe i have a problem
recommended
endless hours of fun once you begin a game its very hard to stop playing just like all of the previous civilization games if i were to give this a 110 score id give it a 910

good game as it stands but the dlc makes it a much much better game

this game is very veeery addicting gandhi nuked me 2310 valve no not nerf
recommended
this game is superbly time consuming and highly addictive indeed this game is a time machine game do not play this game it has high chance to ruin your life dont tell me that i didnt warn you
recommended
hours and hours on this game and still there is more to do one match of civ is like a whole game of other games 1010 not found a game as good as this
recommended
certainly one of the best strategy games from one of the best strategy game companies civilization 5 is a strategy game about controling an empire throughout human historyfrom the settling of the first towns to the near future and is fun in every part the game manages to have the same concepts at all times but still having different flavors depending on how far into a game you are great incredible amount of contentdoing everything the game has to offer is next to impossible on top of this the game is very addictive with stuff going on constantly to keep you hooked good game concepts are very well made with one exception and the game looks very nice and has a fitting art style combat is much more refined than past civ games ommiting the stack of death involving placing 30 units into one tile and bashing a city for minutes until one unit happens to win bad vanilla version of the game is lacking not to say its bad but the complete version for 50$ is far superior and 50 dollars is a lot compared to some other options also the happiness concept is a bit flawed having an unhappy civilization all but stops expanison causing cities to not grow and also giving you a economic and military penalty in order to keep a civilization happy you must find luxury resources which may be inacessible to you without a crazy amount of effort or trading or may be right on your doorstep also the ai seems to get a happiness bonus who rarely have a problem with the unruly masses its kind of unfair ugly the game is a bit unstable and is prone to crashing i cant play on full screen as my gpu becomes overused and the game needs to shut down other crashes are seemingly random with little to no explanation on why tldr its good crashes sometimes but its good 910 oh yeah id get the civilization sdk whatever that stands for along with this in the game tools section of steam its a game editing tool that allows for map creation and making your own mods
recommended
strategy that looks like a chess its quite fun
recommended
just one more turn said everyone who has ever played civ v played just one more turn no one who has stated the previous quote oh yeah and f ghandi
recommended
do you want to play for more than eight sixteen or maybe twentyfour hours to become the greatest civilization in economy religion tourism miltary power or religion well if that is the case this game is extremely addictive when you start you dont want to stop until your child your fragile civilization becomes the owner of the world i would say the only great defect of this game is the multiplayer it improved a lot but still has some bugs and performance issues no mention that is really hard to play with strangers without getting kicked or suffer quiters an important note the game improves a lot since gods & kings and much more with brave new world the vainilla version lacks some importants features which make it too similar to his previous version civilization iv which is dissapointing at least but with a complete version you have fun guarantee and if you bore of this you can play the scenarios to get some tasty variations
recommended
much rather contract the highest form of autism then play what is essientially a map simulator with a fresh coat of paint after playing this game i got cancer in the eyes and im pretty sure i wanted to  my friend gary

this game behaves just like women do you have to wait for ages and when it comes to multiplayeraction the answer is no

recommended
this is a really good game
recommended
good game but dont plan on finishing the game in one hour or so
recommended
great game where you can play at your own pace
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
this game and i have a lovehate relationship while i would consider this game to definitely be in my top ten it is dangerously addictive i find myself going down a deep rabbit hole when i play this game because of how engrossing the premice of the game is for those of you who havent had the chance of picking up a copy of a game in this series so far think of yourself as warned the outside world will not know what happened to you until you can finally find the strength to crawl out of your darkhole from which you have been engrossed in for the passed 8 days known as civilization your friends will understand game summary now for a quick rundown of how the game works the title to the game describes the plot in itself you are the plot you start by choosing from a number of civilizations listed ranging from 18th century america under george washington to napolean of france how large you want the planet you are set on and how many other civilizations and city states you want to play against can either be determined by the player or randomly selected once you drop into the world youll start out with a settler and a warrior in order to found your capital city and explore the surrounding lands each civilization has the gift of a specific bonus to its empire as well as excess units and buildings which can be constructed only by that civilization as your civilization progresses you eventually start to get more and more choice you will move through each era depending on what technologies you research with this freedom of choice players can also choose how they interact with other civilizations and city states eventually depending on what routes the player chooses to take in developing their civilization there will be a number of options for how one can win the game you can either achieve a science victory by researching all of the technologies and blasting off into space in order to plant your flag into the soil of a distant earth like planet you can conquer the entire world with rutheless military might and capturing the capital of all other opposing ingame civs for a domination victory these are jsut a few of the options available the great thing about this game is rather than following a linear path for play you really get to make history yourself or if you want to go about doing it with a friend drop into a match and play it out with your buddy mods the second best thing about civ v besides it being civ v is that the game is very community orientated there are hundreds upon hundreds of mods sitting in the steam workshop in this game ranging from new ingame civilizations to playable scenarios the development team over at firaxis did a great job in allowing variety for such a trully immersive game and one of the best ways theyve done that is by letting the community take adding on new parts to the game themselves dlc the core game itself is fantastic but i would really recommend both dlcs for this game they are a bit pricy so you might save some cash by just picking up the civ v gold edition during a steam sale if you really want to get the fullest experience of the game not only does it add a number of new civilzations that are personally my favorite to play as it also brings back religion from the previous games in order to spread your pious agenda across the globe to assist in your victory it also brings back spying as well as trade routes trade routes help for boosting ones economic output when connecting to other civilizations but they can also provide science and spread religion to other cities these factors are just the tip of the iceberg especially considering there are so many mods on the steam workshop which require either the gods and kings dlc or the brave new world addon in the end they are both fantastic ingame content packs and really worth the extra penny
recommended
perhaps one of the best strategies on your pc

dear godruined my lifei forgot my friends names that i had a dog hell i wasnt even sure i was alivethis is what happens when you playfor five hoursive played for 239i have no more life to worry about because civ is my life my love my reason my only sun in the skyoh yeah and you should convert to the religon of civ ruined of my life 900110 oh and dont in listen to that fat  ghandihe nuked mefour times

recommended
awesome game buy it and come play against me
recommended
this game stole away my life do not buy unless you like losing all your free time
recommended
this game is handsdown my favorite game ever created
recommended
well the 251 hours played on this game most likely explain how much i like it however it can get a little boring if you only play on your own so sadly if you have no friends your screwed
recommended
ive never played any of the previous civ games and im a huge fan of catan a boardonline game it reminded me of so this automatically won me over civ 5 is more complex than catan in that it has more features to offer and its more organized less random and more relaxed whereas you can never predict what your opponents are gonna do in catan so it gets pretty intense you play a historical leader each civ comes with perks and choose how you interact with other leaders and their civilizations you can build whatever you want from armies to cities as the technology and resources become available to you throughout the centuries its addicting and so much fun i can only imagine the shenanigans and how awesome itd be to get a group of friends to play plus im really diggin a lot of the references made with the achievement names cant believe i didnt get into this sooner
recommended
it ing sucks 42010 ign
recommended
imagine being locked in a room with big gaz g and razza while mr west films it all this is the opposite of that situation
recommended
when played with all the expansions and dlcs quite simply the best pc game ever at least in my opinion
recommended
i have a very soft spot for the civilization series civilization iii is to my memory the first game i ever played i have since played 2 the snes version of the original and this like the rest of the series its decently polished easy to learn has a lot of depth and is periliously addictive i didnt get into it as much as i did iii but thats probably just nostalgic bias if i had to complain i would say that the diploacy is rather limited and not being able to trade communications blows thankfully the rest of the game does it also i nuked beijing eleven times in a row and it still stood with two citzens who refused to die district 13 style 1110
recommended
great turnbased game amazing graphics and infinite possibilities and endings
recommended
if youve never played a civilization game before expect the learning curve to be a brick wall you may be a seasoned gamer whos used to playing on normal or hard on other games right from the getgo but if you are brand new to this series play on super easy mode first to learn and experiment before trying harder difficult levels that said once youve learned the basics of the game and are ready for more challenging experiences you will be greatly rewarded games typically last between 1 and 12 hours depending on the type of victory you seek and the pace you set in the beginning and you will never have the same experience twice giving this game a massive replay value there are always new maps to play on new allies to make new choices that will decide the games outcome and new diplomatic challenges to face civ v does a great job of landing you into a new game and you always feel satisfied by the games end even if you lose that by itself always leaves you wanting to play more even if you somehow get bored of playing in singleplayer vanilla mode multiplayer is offered and there are a plethora of mods out there to try so if youre patient and willing to learn i highly recommend this game and its expansion packs
recommended
truly a great game relatively slow paced at times but so full of content especially with the expansions brave new world  gods and kings
recommended
just look at how many hours ive spend playing it
recommended
i had to uninstall this game to keep miself from playing it
recommended
       total war

sid meiers civilization v is a god among games if you dont get it you are mentally 
recommended
ive been saying to myself this is the last turn i swear but im just not able to quit these are the problems that show up as soon as you begin understanding the fundementals of this game sid meiers civlization v is a turnbased 4x game where you manage you cities and make sure your people are well fed and happy the goal in this game is to be the most progressive population on the planet you start out with a city that fits the population youve chosen from here on out you start exploring and building things with the first unit you will find things like ruins and barbarian camps the barbarians are your first real enemy you will have to try to fight them off while progressing your first city when you start expanding alot you find out that the barbarians are not a real threat anymore in fact you will be alot more busy with the other populations on the map the other populations can be friendly but also an enemy this is where diplomacy comes in some leaders of the populations may trick you and create traps to backstab you after a while so you have to be carefull on what you decide whats best you also get to trade and discuss with these leaders for instance you could trade a luxury that your population wishes for after a couple of hundered turns youll get the hang of it and start liking the game alot for me its the progressing that makes me hooked to this game its the mentality of just finishing this one thing that makes it soo addicting to me i find it to be one of the best games i have every played this is the first civilization game i ever played but now i regret that i never played the previous parts of this series all in all a great game i highly recommend it
recommended
this game is just pure awesome it allows you to run your own kingdom while either combating or being buddies with others you must also develop technology and build a military and industry the beginning game options are pretty nice too the allow you to pick who you are how long you want the game to play out what era it starts in the world layout and many more things its such a huge games that i could sit here for hours typing up everything and the best part is you can get more stufff with workshop id say 1010 for this game
recommended
this game is ruining my life
recommended
1010 would get nuked by gandhi again
recommended
gandhinukedgermany10 would play for all eternity

if you are going to buy this game you need the brave new world dlc once you have that it will be great expirience i recommend this game extensivly 910

recommended
this game by far is my favorite most replayable game i have it never gets boring and is always different each time i play it recommended x1000

civilization 5 is possibly one of the most diverse strategy games to be released in the past 10 years often you are faced with killing everyone in the game just to win but sid meirs civilization 5 lets you choose how to win let it be cultural diplomatic science or if youre a fan of eliminating the competition domination civilization 5 puts you in the seat of historical leaders with unique building or units and also unique traits that relate to how they ruled or dominated in the past replay value is a huge strongpoint for this game the randomly generated maps with customizable options will drop you into a fresh experience every time you play a match the game also features maps such as europe mediterranean and earth the maps have accurate placements of geographic features that correlate to the real world landscape most importantly for me about civilization is the huge knowledge you can earn from playing the game learn how leaders commanded their armies and how they rushed for continents to settle on natural wonders and world wonders have descriptions that tell you history about them all in all civ is an amazing game that i would recommend everyone to buy even if youre not a huge strategy buff this will definitely make you think twice
recommended
this game was very dumbeddown compared to civ 4 nontheless it has unlimited replayability and enjoyable gameplay overall 910
recommended
love it
recommended
love this game <3

civ 5 is one of those games were you will say oh i will play for 5 or maybe 10 minutes just to see how your empire is doing 8 hours later youve just won the space race and have to get ready for school this is what this game is like its always just one more turn alright just one more turn please and you keep going because you want to discovere flight so you can bomb your enermies from the sky and so on there is just something magical about the game the soundtrack is just divine and the graphics if youve got a good enough pc are amazing in terms of gameplay massive changes have made since the civ 4 days for example you can no longer just pile unites on top of each orther and in stead of sqaures you now move in hexes these new features that may seem small but change the game in a big way the game is with out a doubt is worth your money i give sid meiers civilization v a 1010 enjoy

its really fun 
recommended
once you know how to play you could basically spend hours playing without even getting bored but if you think that the game is still missing a little something the workshop is full of mods that could spice your game up
recommended
people who are actually good at reviews will have already done a better job at explaining what makes this game fun me personally i just like ghandis method of acheiving peace through a scarcity of living enemies
recommended
if you want to spend all of your life on a game that you probably wont like at first but end up getting addicted to get this game
recommended
this game will make you wonder if you ever really could trust your friends
recommended
just one more turn then ill write the review
recommended
i absolutely recommend this game to anyone with even a passing interest in the turn based strategy genre while the base cam can be said to fall a bit short of the greatness mark once youve got both of the expansions the game begins to truly shine everyone from the neophyte stratigist to the grand master generals will find this game to their liking i would highly recommend this game
recommended
well i got this game expecting amazing stuff and what came out of what pure amazingness and it made me poop like litteraly all over my walls i had hire 400 men to clean off the poop it was so deeply stained into the wall like they didnt think they could save the house but i told them to believe just like i believed in civilization v they cheered they roared in the awe i was presenting of amazingness then they got to work and within 4 years they cleaned my house into a palace of versailes and then and then only did i poop all over the walls again knowing of the legendary of amazingness civilization v  it is also teaches strategy which also helped the men clean the walls good luck players 
recommended
great game requires many hours to complete and can sometimes take over your day
recommended
very entertaining like a good facebookgame without hours of wait
recommended
another great add to the civ series
recommended
i really enjoy civ 5 it is a good mix of strategy and action i think anyone could have fun with this game
recommended
while the base game leaves out a lot of features i loved in the older games of the series ie espionage religion it it still a great game and i really cant wait for the next installment in this amazing series can this series stand the test of time
recommended
i enjoy playing civ 5 you can take you time you can also win by timewar etc 1010 good game to play when you get bored and when you have nothing to do so you should try to enjoy it as much as i have
recommended
just  play it plebs
recommended
at first i really diddnt think i would like this game it just diddnt seem in my style the only reason i bought it in the first place is because all my friends bought it on the humble bundle anyways i tried the game out and i was immidiently hooked in the first week i had more game time on it then even tf2 the game is extremely user friendly and real easy to learn if you put your time into it i absolutly love the content in the game even though the dlc may be a bit pricey all in all i highly recommend this game to anyone who has enough time on there hands and loves strategy
recommended
cant exclaim enough how much i love this game one of if not the best series ever i have played this game since early childhood and each version of the game just gets better and better this latest edition civ v is absolutely stunning addicting challenging epic who doesnt want to conquer the world
recommended
this game swagalicious
recommended
who doesnt like going around destroying your friends hard work and laughing in their face no but seriously this game is really awesome it brings back memories of old conquest games and this one is just the next level of awesome really nice designed layout and overall feel they only problem i did have with the game was the fact the maps even on large were not actually that big i always seem to be close to somebody but overall this game rocks and you should try it and build a civilization to stand the test of time p
recommended
thanks to the streamlined experience and some simplification civ v makes for the best multiplayer experience out of the series unfortunately for the same reason civ iv is probably the better single player experience as there feels to be more depth and you have all the time in the world to finish your turn vanilla can feel too restrictive and frustrating due to some of these changes but brave new world brings around some exciting end game features meaning that runaway civs arent always guaranteed to win past t150 or so if you got a group of likeminded friends who like strategy board games like risk or axis and allies i cannot recommend this game enough
recommended
once you will start you will not be able to end  one more turn
recommended
this game ruins friendships
recommended
this took my life this took my soul this took my everything how can someone create such an addicting game i mean i dont normally even like strategybased games still in just a few days i have accomplished to play 30 hours of this game at first i tried it with my friends on multiplayer i had no idea what to do and succeeded to build a city then after a few turns i tried to understand it a bit and at last i took an interest in the game later on i started a singleplayer save and hot damn it took time to get off the computer everything about the game is great so many different civilizations so many choices for your worlds shape also running out of people to play as is no problem there is always the workshop i just love how you start as a one small town and at the end you are some kind of gigantic nation but that of course depend on how you play it also i like about how many things you can do in this game you can research all kinds of things you can build all kinds of buildings and you can train all kinds of units 105 would buy again even though a friend gifted this to me buy it now
recommended
what more can be said about this game than what others have already said this game is a massive time sink and thats a good thing its a just one more turn type game that will leave you realizing that its 430 in the morning
recommended
i dont even own the game wut
recommended
sid meiers civilization v what can you say about game or the civilization series that hasnt been said already if your a fan of turn based strategy games this is a no brainier get it if your thinking of getting civ 5 and havent played the others get it this game probably has to be one of the most addictive games of all time
recommended
wow much civ very science much culture
recommended
definitely tons of fun with friends its very time consuming so sometimes its hard to keep a large group together in one save let alone complete one despite that though worth every penny and tons of enjoyable hours spent on this game
recommended
this is a great game of stragety and dominance i ighly recomend it if you are a strategy type of person
recommended
i have spent over 400 hours playing this game and it just never gets old it is especially engaging once you by gods & kings and brave new world dlcs which add religion ideology and dozens of new leaders this game is simply a must buy
recommended
civilization 5 is possibly one of the most diverse strategy games to be released in the past 10 years often you are faced with killing everyone in the game just to win but sid meirs civilization 5 lets you choose how to win let it be cultural diplomatic science or if youre a fan of eliminating the competition domination civilization 5 puts you in the seat of historical leaders with unique building or units and also unique traits that relate to how they ruled or dominated in the past replay value is a huge strongpoint for this game the randomly generated maps with customizable options will drop you into a fresh experience every time you play a match the game also features maps such as europe mediterranean and earth the maps have accurate placements of geographic features that correlate to the real world landscape most importantly for me about civilization is the huge knowledge you can earn from playing the game learn how leaders commanded their armies and how they rushed for continents to settle on natural wonders and world wonders have descriptions that tell you history about them all in all civ is an amazing game that i would recommend everyone to buy even if youre not a huge strategy buff this will definitely make you think twice

civilization v is a very complex but easy to follow game with many different ways to play it you can invite some friends or people you dont know to have a massive battle for victory with the unique methods of winning culture domination time and science you can load up some scenarios to play without having to start from scratch or maybe the single player mode catches your eye by setting up your game just how you like it never have i seen a game so fun and player friendly in a very long time once you start playing you cannot stop let alone the easytoinstall 2 dlc packs for 20 each so worth every penny if you enjoy a fantastic balance between strategy and action buy this game right now thanks for reading
recommended
civ v is without a doubt one of the best games on steam everyone i know who played this game enjoyed it thoroughly the replay value is amazing both expansions add some real new dimensions and do a great job to alter the game mechanics in a way that no other expansion has before stop reading you should be playing civ v

recommended
completely sold my army research labs and resources to stop ethopia from winning a diplomatic victory and then declares war all but capital destroyed about to be taken wins cultural victory 1010
recommended
really really really really fun strategy game turn based if you need a singleplayer game that will keep you busy for as long as your brain remains inside your head this is it singleplayer offers nearly limitless gameplay youll only quit after you realize your strategy is the same thing game after game however if you mix up your strategy its like playing a whole new game or at least something like that eh worst part of the game is its slow load screen to the main menu even and all the paid dlcs still its worth whatever the initial asking price is at the moment its worth at least $30
recommended
1010  amazing love it would fap to  again
recommended
great turnbased game amazing graphics and infinite possibilities and endings
recommended
it smells of succession and addiction
recommended
while i still think civ iii was the crowning achievement in this series i cant dismiss how good this iteration is start it up and get ready for hours to fly by
recommended
can spend hours playing this game and not even realise once you start building up your civilzation you wont want to stop its sooo addictive
recommended
its civilization nuff said
recommended
but did you get brave new world did you go get it now
recommended
by far the best turnbased strategy game ive ever played also i highly reccomended both of the major dlcs they give you a whole new game to play
recommended
while i really love this game and think it is very good multiplayer is a joke when you arent dcing you come back to find the ai even if its only been one turn has entierly ed your stratagey moved your troops spent your gold founded new cities ect its a pain in the  to fix i reccomend the game but if you have problems dcing dont play multiplayer i personally think it should ask the game host if they want to continue playing when someone dcs to prevent the ai takeover from hell
recommended
with the release of brave new world and recent patches this games has become a definitive musthave for everyone interested in the civilization franchise or turn based strategy in general good visuals great music and endless sessions await you ive already invested a lot of my time into this game and with bnw im looking forward to invest even more
recommended
great game really fun
recommended
see what happens if mayans still existed in the year 2012 blow up gandhi surrender to france in irony anything can happen in civ 5
recommended
extraordinarily fun and complex even small matches can easily last upwards of 6 hours and each one is unique to the extent that your strategy must constantly evolve and change for each situation resulting in potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay truly mastering this game is like mastering chess in that you never really quit learning but dammit if i get beat to a culture victory by one turn after a six hour game again im burning down a museum
recommended
this is a great game of stragety and dominance i ighly recomend it if you are a strategy type of person
recommended
i have spent over 400 hours playing this game and it just never gets old it is especially engaging once you by gods & kings and brave new world dlcs which add religion ideology and dozens of new leaders this game is simply a must buy
recommended
a very addicting and absolutely fantastic game if you can pick up both map packs with the game itself for a reduced price it is definitely worth getting the content and ai tweaks and changes make a big difference when playing even though i have played only 103 hrs when writing this review there are still many many different civilisations i have yet to play if you are new to civilisation games there are many tutorials on steam to look through the ingame tutorials are pretty decent as well
recommended
a really good game the single player is very good and the multiplayer is even better but its the dlc that really makes the game come alive the mods dont always work

have an hour until you need to get to work i guess this is the game to spend your time on once you start playing there is no going back until you lose of course back in the past when i had this game torrented i had spent over 14 hours straight playing it turned me into a monster that even my parents rejected me they wanted me off the computer but i denied them and told them that my time is needed to be spent here playing civilization is similar to being locked in limbo the only way out is to either win correctly or lose with dignity if you intend to play for 5 minutes make it a couple days your life will turn upside down and you wont know what hit you your girlfriend wants sex what do you say  no sex is for the weak this game will teach the ups and downs of society religion and war it will teach you what the true meaning of greed is dont let your gaurd down the  in greece the ai bot will  that you are too close to their land  them over when you get the chance show all who is boss 1010 get this game 100% no regrets
recommended
great game
recommended
this is a truly amazing game its fun to play and has so much replay value it will cause you to play for hours on end thinking just one more turn the multiplayer however is also fantastic and makes the gameplay even more interesting but it can be very buggy and prone to random crashes often making the experience enraging and annoying lucky the majority of the time this game runs smoothly and without issue making it more than worthwhile for any gamer interested in the strategy genre however i strongly recommend if i was you purchase the complete edition version of the game as the gods and kings and brave new world expansion packs make this game even more exceptional fixes many of the base games issues and bugs while presenting the player with a massive extension to the base game the packs basically add two extra massive games into the already massive base game overall this game scores a 710  fantastic experience and replayability  amazing and worthwhile expansions  fun and challenging multiplayer  multiplayer is often full of bugs and random crashes
recommended
great game civ v will provide one with countless hours of stragetic fun there is more than one way get a victory in the game which will provide many options on how to arrive to one eac dlc only improves your experience and adds more hours of fun the civ series gets better and better so far this is a must have for anyones library
recommended
i r recommend cuz it stole mah sleep 3
recommended
addicted i need help cant stop just one more turn im a renewb to the genre so i wont go into technical and comparison to any other newbs i recommend checking out the steam community guides if you find yourself overwhelmed by the plethora of setup options and want some frustration saving strategy hints totally worth a little reading time very few games out there keep me playing after the main objective has been met i cant even properly describe why why i cant stop once you get past the initial learning curve it becomes seductively simple and almost hypnotic youll be all like hey i can have this running and do a turn here and there while im getting on with something else 4 hours later ill do it in a minute just one more turn graphically its a pleasant enough mask for the clever mechanics many ways to play and win nice array of buildings and units stealth and nuclear missile being my favourites oh hello looking round my border are we boom shiq ill melt your faces off and rub my butt all over your tiles the ui is uncluttered and easy to find your way around tooltips and tutorial messages and ingame help are surprisingly helpful the community is active and awesomely creative the achievements are plentiful but stretched across dlcs recommended for people with time to spare
recommended
play as a variety of civilisations in a fight to survive will you be a warmonging country going for fast expansion and a conquest of the world will you be diplomatic aiming to trade and ally will you be sneaky pretending to ally with a country and then wipe them off the face of the earth there are so many options and each country has a relevant perk very much true to history which you can rewrite did japan take over korea did spain destroy everyone and control the map or did germany choose to be a friendly negotiating country its up to you in a world of endless possibilities another must have my game library wouldnt be complete without it and neither is yours

it all started when our protagonist civ 5 woke up in a pumpkin patch it was the fourth time it had happened feeling ridiculously exasperated civ 5 groped a sock thinking it would make him feel better but as usual it did not unexpectedly he realized that his beloved  of truth was missing immediately he called his friend leroy jenkins civ 5 had known leroy jenkins for plus or minus one million years the majority of which were sassy ones leroy jenkins was unique he was intelligent though sometimes a little dimwitted civ 5 called him anyway for the situation was urgent leroy jenkins picked up to a very happy civ 5 leroy jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating yet otters usually earnestly grimace after mating he had no idea what that meant he was only concerned with distracting civ 5 why was leroy jenkins trying to distract civ 5 because he had snuck out from civ 5s with the  of truth only four days prior it was a saucy little  of truth how could he resist it didnt take long before civ 5 got back to the subject at hand his  of truth leroy jenkins sighed relunctantly leroy jenkins invited him over assuring him theyd find the  of truth civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately after hanging up the phone leroy jenkins realized that he was in trouble he had to find a place to hide the  of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully he figured that if civ 5 took the truck he had take at least eleven minutes before civ 5 would get there but if he took the  then leroy jenkins would be alarmingly screwed before he could come up with any reasonable ideas leroy jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his  of truth leroy jenkins sighed not again he thought feeling frustrated he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them apparently this was an adequate deterrentthe discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket squealing with discontent he exhaled with relief thats when he heard the  rolling up it was civ 5 o0o as he pulled up he felt a sense of urgency he had had to make an unscheduled stop at walmart to pick up a 12pack of pencils so he knew he was running late with a calculated leap civ 5 was out of the  and went indiscriminately jaunting toward leroy jenkinss front door meanwhile inside leroy jenkins was panicking not thinking he tossed the  of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano leroy jenkins was concerned but at least the  of truth was concealed the doorbell rang come in leroy jenkins sassily purred with a careful push civ 5 opened the door sorry for being late but i was being chased by some funnysmelling maniac in a vette he lied its fine leroy jenkins assured him civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where leroy jenkins had hidden the  of truth leroy jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness uhh can i get you anything he blurted but civ 5 was distracted without warning leroy jenkins noticed a selfish look on civ 5s face civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak whats that smell leroy jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when civ 5 asked this in a moment of disbelief he realized that he had hidden the  of truth right by his oscillating fan whwhat i dont smell anything a lie a insensitive look started to form on civ 5s face he turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place thththose are just my grandmas mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies she uhdropped em by here earlier civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgementthen before leroy jenkins could react civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it the  of truth was plainly in view civ 5 stared at leroy jenkins for what what mustve been four seconds unexpectedly leroy jenkins groped wildly in civ 5s direction clearly desperate civ 5 grabbed the  of truth and bolted for the door it was locked leroy jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle if only you hadnt been so protective of that thing none of this would have happened civ 5 he rebuked leroy jenkins always had been a little insensitive so civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option he needed to escape before leroy jenkins did something crazy like start chucking mittens at him or something all of a sudden he gripped his  of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window diving headlong through the glass panels leroy jenkins looked on blankly what the hell that seemed excessive the other door was open you know silence from civ 5 and to think i varnished that window frame nine days agoit never ends suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for civ 5 oh you okay still silence leroy jenkins walked over to the window and looked down civ 5 was gone o0o just yonder civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind leroy jenkinss place civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident and was starting to lose strength another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared having caught wind of the  of truth one by one they latched on to civ 5 already weakened from his injury civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his  of truth about seven hours later civ 5 awoke his butt throbbing it was dark and civ 5 did not know where he was deep in the humid desert civ 5 was abundantly lost a few minutes later he remembered that his  of truth was taken by the aligators but at that point he was just thankful for his life thats when to his horror a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield it was the alpha aligator civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into civ 5s face with a faint groan the life escaped from civ 5s lungs but not before he realized that he was a failure less than two miles away leroy jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the  of truth my precious he cried as he reached for a sharpened spoon with a heroic thrust he buried it deeply into his neck as the room began to fade to black he thought about civ 5 wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him but he would die alone that day all that remained was the  of truth that had turned them against each other ultimately causing their demise and as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawns reddish glare all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come our heroes wouldve lived unhappily ever after but they were too busy being dead so no one lived forever after the end

always has been a great game
recommended
this game was surprisingly good i dont like strategy games but this one was awesome
recommended
one of the best strategy games ive played challenging and fun but be ready for very long games
recommended
this installment of the civilization franchise has the best gameplay you will find in any civilization game guiding an empire from fledgling tribal city into world spanning empire is amazing and does not get stale even over many iterations of founding and building nations excellent graphics help add to the game and the fact that leonard nimoy does loads of voicework in the game is great overall highly recommend the game and the expansion packs for it including gods & kings and brave new world which add new civilizations scenarios and units that keep the game interesting
recommended
i bought this game without any idea of what to expect took some time to understand but now i think its a really great game its different than other strategy games but i think its nice not having to be quick since i never been to good at that i recommend it strongly especially if you like strategy with more thinking time
recommended
couldnt write an articulate review have to play my next turn
recommended
veterans of the civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration but the expansions gkbnw add a lot of content back and steam frequently has them for sale to be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1armypersquare and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first however i really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the ai i still think the ai for civ is still too predictable and even when set on random a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level still recommend the game for fans and newcomers you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect civ
recommended
civ 5 is probably one of my all time favorite games though not as in depth as other civ games civ 5 is an amazing game worth playing reply value is incredible every civilization is unique and different in many ways and never seems to get boring thanks to a wide variety of difficulty settings and expansion packs i highly recommend this to anyone who is new to strategy games or to any experienced veteran out there i also recommend the expansion packs to improve gameplay civ 5 to say the least is a truly remarkable piece of art and quite addicting at that the ai may be a little funky at times but that is to be expected for nearly every game i would pay 50 dollars for this game evidently that was the price when it first came out it is just that good and that is saying something for myself because i am quite frugal and prefer to only purchase games when they are on sale this is one of those games that you will be up till 4 am in the morning telling yourself just one more turn
recommended
never have i ever not even once had a session of this game that was not a complete blast what cant be said about civ v its the peak of gridded strategy games not only will you have to plan out what direction you want your civilization to go in terms of how cultured scientific wealthy and happiness youll also have to keep track of the plots and connections of various citystates and of course other civilizations you can play a plethora of leaders to be the ruler of your civ each leader is unique and different to play however they are all fun to play theres no real bad or op leader the real fun of civ v is the mulitplayer whether you hop on a public server or have a match with your friends civilization will have you laughing sweating cheering crying and swearing from a player with 60 hours and no completed games i <3 this game
recommended
amazing game i can play for hours and still have fun looks lovely and has lots of content 1010 recommend to everyone

absoluteley great game

sid meiers civilization is one of if not the best tbs on the market civ v added to the collection of the others and is not a downgrade in anyway i will state that the multiplayer could use a much needed revamp but the single player works completely fine the ai as for most civ games will attempt to do outragous deals or not abide by what you say but the flow of the game great the expansions are also worth almost every penny and a new one is on the way

amazing having 500 hours on it already it just one more turn

quick summary the fifth edition of one of the most classic strategy games on the pc purchase verdict yes i personally would wait for a sale though points of interest im not a huge fan of this type of strategy game but found it fun while playing with friends online a semiactive community workshop that allows for a lot of customization offers plenty of different ways to win you build your nation the way you want to build your nation

buy this game it is amazing

after doing a few sex favors for a horny gamer girl that ive known since the vietnam war i finally traded naked pics with an australian mafia to smuggle videogames and one of them was civ which stands for cant into vidya if only starcraft 2 heart of the quickscope were on steam id be reccomending that instead but civ was made by people who clearly failed middle school world geography because i started as mayans and found the city of venice a few miles or tiles away and those crazy italians tried to culturally enrich my  but i called the powers of montezuma and la muerte peluda to overthrow their  but that wasnt the end because later came the dunegook empire trying to take over my new land and i had to 1v1 quickscope with the arab nerdlord and put them to shame because im american and i still remember the alamo

more friendships have been tested through this game truly it is a game that many will play for entire weeks without pause great game overall and all friends must endure it

the ultimate strategy game civ v pits you in glorious combat through brute force or brains in an epic showdown for up to as many as 19 players with ais and other people it is an amazing game for people who like strategy the challenge of difficulty levels 58 hardest or the almost godmodelike easygoingness of the easy difficulty levels 14 however if you are a person who doesnt like to use stuff from archers to nukes and wants to actually take part in the battles well they didnt classify this as fps now did they still an amazing game and totally worth it especially when you get to the dlc
recommended
its a classical you wont be dissapointed and you will not get bored of this magnificant game i dare you to buy it
recommended
at the time of writing this review i have spent more than a whole day on this game yes more than 24 hours civilization v is a game where you are a leader of an empire tasked to rule the world every turn you can move your people in the game they are called units around to build fight and conquer i think thats how its spelt other ai civilizations are also spawned in and your task is to beat them there are different ways of winning the game such as researching different things and spreading your religion dlc the modding on this game is brilliant you get an achievement just for subscribing to an item in the steam workshop and another if you play that mod you can download any type of mod from a lotr map really good to a completely new civilization the game doesnt need the dlc to make the game good the base game is magnificent it really is but i advise getting the dlc as well the dlc to this game is amazing the main dlcs gods and kings and brave new world havwe a heavy price tag so i would advise buying the complete edition because it saves you  overall i would rate this game 1010
recommended
great great great great game just like buy it its best strategy
recommended
i think it is the best iteration of the civilization franchise yet letting no more than one combat unit occupy a space expands the tactcal strategy of the game a must by and excellent expansions

sid meiers civ 5 is the latest forray into civilization building from this acclaimed series it is also the first in the series that i have played so my review of the game is unbiased by the previous installments many have said that civ 3 is the best or that civ 4 is the only one to play but ive found that civ 5 is an excellent game that stands quite easily on its own merits and is definitely worth a play by anyone that enjoys a long drawn out turn based civilization management game pros wonderfully polished many civilizations to choose from great music extremely variable gameplay cons some dx bugs resource intensive laptops tend to lag might spend too much time playing this game a relaxing game that you can dump hours into this is one of the best multiplayer games that ive had the joy of playing and singleplayer is also a blast the expansion gods and kings while expensive is totally worth purchasing the other dlc is good but since theres so much of it wait for a sale a
recommended
veterans of the civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration but the expansions gkbnw add a lot of content back and steam frequently has them for sale to be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1armypersquare and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first however i really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the ai i still think the ai for civ is still too predictable and even when set on random a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level still recommend the game for fans and newcomers you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect civ
recommended
civ 5 is probably one of my all time favorite games though not as in depth as other civ games civ 5 is an amazing game worth playing reply value is incredible every civilization is unique and different in many ways and never seems to get boring thanks to a wide variety of difficulty settings and expansion packs i highly recommend this to anyone who is new to strategy games or to any experienced veteran out there i also recommend the expansion packs to improve gameplay civ 5 to say the least is a truly remarkable piece of art and quite addicting at that the ai may be a little funky at times but that is to be expected for nearly every game i would pay 50 dollars for this game evidently that was the price when it first came out it is just that good and that is saying something for myself because i am quite frugal and prefer to only purchase games when they are on sale this is one of those games that you will be up till 4 am in the morning telling yourself just one more turn
recommended
hello this is very good game pls jones and ellstrm buy this game it is very good and also tres bien as the french often say gg wp

could have sworn i did osmething liek this before ever wanted to take the reigns and manage your own nation well now you can  take command of prestigious nations like the usa great britian japan china russia germany and much more and contrcut cities even rename them if youd like and bound your nation forward through the starting era of your choosingbe fro mthe ancient era or even disregarding that and just starting in the future era with all technology unlocked you can negotiate with other nations through trade agreemnets research partnerships and much more your peopel giving you trouble with belly aching or is your nation incapable of producing that little osmething you want go talk to a discovered civilizatio nand see if they have it up for trade  i recommend this game to those who have always dreamed of commanding their own nations give it a try

recommended
its very good with friends a bit crap by yourself because the ai is stupid very fun and always engaging gandi is a very violent man in this game
recommended
this game asks one simple question can you build a nation that will stand the test of time its not an easy question to work out yes to if youre looking for a challenge the ai might be random at times or it might be entirely logical but from playing it ive learned you should always keep on your toes outside of easy the computer players can outmatch you but not just militarily  unless you hit the ground running you can be quickly overshadowed this incarnation of the civilization franchise makes a lot of changes namely the switch from a grid to hexagons and the removal of the ability to stack units some people loathe this but after playing it ive found the whole thing less of a meatgrinder no throwing your army at a stack of 23 armies on one square no 31 stack of armies lying in wait when you attack an enemy city in fact the system makes it more viable and likely to surround a city which is what happened in most wars by the way rather than charge headlong at it with a bulk army every detail of the world is beautifully rendered sometimes i found myself panning the camera over my and my enemies civs imagining what life is like in the piece of earth they have carved out gods and kings and brave new world  its epansions  at a ton of variety to the game the culture victory option for example involves tourism and cultural influence which is how places like america japan and the uk ingrain their cultural mannerisms elsewhere in the real world the game is not just beautiful on a strategic level im a fan of history and culture and this game is bursting at the seams with it especially with brave new world every technology has an associated quote be it a passage of a holy book a line from a greek roman or shakesperian play or a phrase coined by a legendary person every world wonder you complete shows you an oiloncanvas painting of it complete with a quote that relates to its purpose or its reputation in the second expansion your great people can worldrenowned paintings and compositions which you the player can enjoy for yourself it makes you want to build wonders even more if this is your kind of thing whether youre an empire builder at heart passionate for history love high culture or just enjoy watching burning everything to the ground this is a worthy addition to the franchise so get this get the expansions too even if youre nonreligions gods and kings adds a lot of other stuff to the game this game would be ideal for you just dont expect to be done in a threehour session civ is not a game for the twitch player its famous for that
recommended
easily in the top 5 of all strategic games

im cold

end turn and watch your life waste away

this is honestly the best game ive ever played whenever you play it you jsut want to play it all the way to the end after playing the base game fro awhile i got bored and decided to pick up both dlcs and still trying out all of the civs ive been hosting civ5 tourneys now this game is like the console games for thsoe who play the aaa games this is a mustbuy
recommended
simply brilliant a piece of software that allows you to live and reenact even change most of the important historical events that humankind has ever lived you can quench you thirst for power and domination with this game as well as your blood lust develop a civilization from the very beginning where rocks were weapons to the all modern nuclear fusion death machines take your time and lose your life with this game ive been playing since the beginning of the franchise and i can say that this is the best game so far especially for the crap that civilization iv was if you can afford all the expansions as well dont waste time buy them all brave new world brings the concept of diplomacy and world congress to a new level i strongly recommend playing this if you have some passion for history politics warfare and economics onemoreturn
recommended
civ 5 so much good very nice sometimes i play this game then fall asleep because it lasts 23 hours

always has been a great game
recommended
this game was surprisingly good i dont like strategy games but this one was awesome
recommended
one of the best strategy games ive played challenging and fun but be ready for very long games
recommended
this installment of the civilization franchise has the best gameplay you will find in any civilization game guiding an empire from fledgling tribal city into world spanning empire is amazing and does not get stale even over many iterations of founding and building nations excellent graphics help add to the game and the fact that leonard nimoy does loads of voicework in the game is great overall highly recommend the game and the expansion packs for it including gods & kings and brave new world which add new civilizations scenarios and units that keep the game interesting
recommended
couldnt write an articulate review have to play my next turn
recommended
perfection
recommended
play as a variety of civilisations in a fight to survive will you be a warmonging country going for fast expansion and a conquest of the world will you be diplomatic aiming to trade and ally will you be sneaky pretending to ally with a country and then wipe them off the face of the earth there are so many options and each country has a relevant perk very much true to history which you can rewrite did japan take over korea did spain destroy everyone and control the map or did germany choose to be a friendly negotiating country its up to you in a world of endless possibilities another must have my game library wouldnt be complete without it and neither is yours
recommended
great game just keep an eye on the clock
recommended
build giant death robots and have fun
recommended
one of my most favorite games to date watch out though for it will consume your daytime and nighttime like nothing also dont be afraid to lose even losing while trying out something new is an entertaining experience the expansions are a musthave however as they greatly improve the experience you have while playing as a civilization the multiplayer pales in comparison to the single player but with a good group of friends that doesnt matter just make sure you dont use the option where combat takes turns nobody likes waiting for the enemy to do all of their moves before you can advance or retreat
recommended
a fanastic game that with both expansion packs becomes an endlessly engrossing game that sucks you in for hours while it does lack the systems in civ 4 like pollution it is a simple to learn game that gives you a depth of play styles with its leaders and victory conditions that keeps you coming back for more well worth trying to demo and contracting onemoreturnitis
recommended
best game ever forrest gump vocie thats all i have to say about that
recommended
can spend hours playing this game and not even realise once you start building up your civilzation you wont want to stop its sooo addictive

this game is amazing ive had it and played it for years and it genuinely never gets old it has an infinite amount of replayability and no two games ever end the same way id fully recommend getting the dlc as well as the standalone game seeing as youll lust for more content after you play 100 hours or so and the dlc civ has to offer is fantastic
recommended
im not even a fan of strategy games but dang this game is great
recommended
i didnt trade horses with gandhi so he nuked me it was fun
recommended
as washington i amassed an army of such great magnitude that i decimated every other inferior countries except germany i left bismarck with a tiny isolated island then i nuked them later best 10 hours ever

come one and all kings and generals dictators and leaders of free men across the world and hearken to the rallying cry of all who play just one more turn and that dear reader is how your life slowly begins to disintegrate all around you whilst you dream of hextiled landscapes and every thought becomes that of unit cost vs efficiency fiendishly addictive and a fine addition to the civilization stable that improves with every little bit they add on easily worth all the time and money that you throw at it if youre an armchair politico of any stripe
recommended
this game is very interesting and i can play it for hours it is very realistic and has great depth my friend got me this for my birthday and im glad he did this is a musthave

a really good game the single player is very good and the multiplayer is even better but its the dlc that really makes the game come alive the mods dont always work

recommended
best game ever forrest gump vocie thats all i have to say about that
recommended
civilization 5 has had an interesting journey over the years and remains the game i have most likely wasted the most time on but do not think it is perfect in any ways it is as flawed as a game can be i will not waste time on single player as the ai is either unfair on diety and it is a challenge so far that you have to play one exact way to win or ly stupid and all you do is haul those wonders and wait for a time to attack their attack strategies are mediocre at best and even with number advantage you are able to defeat the opponent without any issues but there is a reason i only played civ beyond earth 30 hours and this game since then 500 hours and it is the multiplayer back in the day i used to play civ 3 with some buddies on hot seat mode and that was a blast so going into civ 5 i started playing mp right away and have not been disappointed well i have been but more on that later the team games are awesome they require great tactics and strategy and are highly competitive given you play with the right group ffas are plenty and can be fun too there is nothing more rewarding than winning a 6 hour game at the beginning there are several ways to be competitive and one has to make quick and rash decisions on whether to build wonders cities or units there is a default way to be effective but one still has to analyse its territory with the addons this just becomes better as one has to decide whether to go for that early pantheon how to deal with city states and potential neighbors sometimes an early rush is the only option you have to succeed this is what makes the game great you are required to make game altering decisions quickly and early it is not like aoe where you can play with a preset mindset as sometimes it just dont work out when you are playing as babylon a science powerhouse but you see yourself surrounded by 2 players your typcial play by rushing great library will not be possible anymore with all the updates and addons i do have to say i like the current setup of wonders as well as the selection of natural wonders there are some which are gamebreaking and are usually banned eg great wall but i do like them as a adjustment to your game the natural wonders are imo also quite nicely balanced except of course el dorado and the fountain of youth which are rare spawns the 500 gold equalizes an early settler buy or 2 workers which gives you a great advantage to do anything fountain of youth gives you 10 happiness plus higher reg you can expand without worries for a long time but it is possible to still defeat a person with these wonders something that can be rewarding the tech tree i always had my issues with as it is pretty locked and sometimes offers little room for strategy there are some techs which are game deciding crossbows and navigation the most apparent ones later one as the tech tree branches out one has to make a decision on getting certain techs while neglecting others one of the toughest decisions is always on whether getting public schools or artillery science or the 3 range unit early on i always play a default setup i rarely adjust it to the start c
recommended
its a fun game to waste a few hours of your day except when that  gandhi decides to nuke your  for demanding 40 gold pieces

i played this game for 10 minutes after that 4 hours had passed 1010 would play again

the most time consuming game you could possibly play

after 200 hours of playtime in civ 5 im still playing the game a ton and enjoying it this game has so much diversity and depth to it that you can immerse yourself in it for hours on end this is arguably the best strategy game ever made and has a lot of replayability i recommend this game to anyone and you can play multiplayer and enjoy the game with friends
recommended
very good game its a shame you never finish a game with more than 3 players
recommended
an okay gameyou know if you like turnbased strategy and all
recommended
this game is just an awesome game i recommend it to everybody that likes a great strategy game this game is probably infinite because after beating the game you can just change civilization and do it in a diffrent way as i said i recommend it to everyone that likes strategy games

civ v taught me how to geography thx civ v

such a good strategic game would recommend other people getting this game

bought it one morning and thought i would play a quick session to see what its like days later im still in my underwear and have not washed nor shaven 1010 would abandon hygeine and social life again
recommended
please love yourself and get this and all the dlc next time it goes 75% off which is relatively often im not sure how veterans to these sorts of turnbased strat games find it but to a total newcomer like me the mechanics are rich and complex it takes a while to become familiar with how everything works im 150 hours in and im still discovering things but that just makes it more enjoyable in my opinion you get out of it whatever you put into it if youre super serious and looking for a challenge this has it if youre interested because youve heard of the potential hilarity that can ensue this certainly has it the worldbuilder dsk that comes with the game is also very enjoyable especially if youre a writer or an artist its a great source of inspiration
recommended
when i look for a strategy game im interested in three things i want a deep and rich strategy platform something that makes you think and really makes you feel like you are in control all decisions good or bad will way into the outcome of the game and only when you are at your best will you obtain victory i want this deep strategy but i also dont want it at the price of over complicating things too much of a good thing as they say it needs to have that deep strategy but not get overly complicated about it last and most obviously the game needs to be entertaining by this i mean that even if the game takes a while to complete as most strategy games do i want to enjoy the entire experience and not feel as though i am grinding through the game or spend unnecessary amounts of time just waiting for things to happen or finish happening civilization v hits this on all points with every expansion the way to victory has become deeper and more rewarding without getting unbalanced or to complicated everything is very intuitive without being too simple you really feel as though you are in control of a civ and building your way to global domination and victory civilization has always been one of the best strategy games out there and the latest instalment continues this tradition 9510

well what can i say its one of the best games i have ever played and obviously its one of the best strategy games ever although its very underestimated compared with other strategy games such as victoria ii and europa universalis iv its fun its not just thinking its also loads of gameplay but vanilla isnt quite fun because you start with many less civilizations plus there are very few mods in the workshop for vanilla my recomendation its waiting unitl summerspringwinterfall sales so you can get it with g&k for 9 dollars instead of 40 i dont know how much the complete edition will cost but it will be totally worth it ok now we come to the part of [insert joke about the game here] lets see ill just play one more turn aaaaaaand its 6 am

this is a genuinely great game and its easy to get into my only problem with it is that the camera control is a bit awkward if you use a laptop but apart from that i havent found any problems with it

most addicting game ever

just one more turn you have to strap your  to the chair until you win the game or you play for so long that you forget who you are

a crazy addictive game that will have you playing day after day to refine your play style and skill truly a great game and a big improvement on the last game in my opinion this is the sort of game that you could leave for a few months and come back to and still enjoy tones of replayability and enough options to make each game completely unique 910

this game is the best its a 1010 except for the time you will spend playing it 11pm turns into 4in the morning before you know it i was so into today that i forgot today was my friends birthdayoppps cant wait for the new one
recommended
there are two types of people in this world  those who dislike civ and those who buy the game and lose the next 16 hours of their life clicking on the next turn button as a 4x game civ does it all economics diplomacy strategy empire macromanagement city micromanagement religious disputes etc and it does all of it in an immersive attractive environment that progresses with the state of your civilization the only real cons are that public multiplayer games take forever without a good method for pausingsavingresuming but this can be remedied by joining a civ steam group or just playing with friends at the very least give the brave new world demo a try and find out how expendable your sleep is

oops its 4 am and i have to work today just one more turn

this game is beautiful addictive and fun

sid meiers civilization v is one of the greatest games i have played with an almost infinite replayability value this game can be played over and over again and get a different experience each time depending on how you set up the game you can play a quick hour or two game or a game that lasts days if you are looking to sit back relax and dominate you can play on an easier setting if you are looking for a very difficult challenge you can play on the hardest difficulty mode and the modding community for this is great and extensive there are all sorts of cool and entertaining mods i really enjoyed this game and its dlcs

the very first game i ever played of sid meiers civilization v was with a few of my friends we decided to all random our leaders i got alexander the great being a fan of history i assumed that he would be a great leader for war and conquering i managed to be an absolute power house i took out the 3 ai civs we had and one of my friends civ the next and final target was the best player out of all of us he was terrified and was desperate for a cultural victory as i sended my forces to rain havoc he took advantage of his many cities thanks to his leaders who was ghandhi unique ability that allowed him to have plenty of happiness with many cities he then switched all of them to science production and then stole the game from me that everyone convinced was mine i didnt talk to him for a week later on in life we made another civ game hoping to have as much fun as before i selected brazil who bonuses from golden ages and is a cultural based civ the same person who stole my victory as ghandhi chose askia a warful civ who benefits from fighting i was working on building the chichen itza a wonder that would increase the length of my golden ages by 100% a huge help to my culture victory i had one turn left until the chichen itza would be complete making me a powerful contender in this very competative game of civ the turn ends and i am extact to show off the completion of my new chichen itza however i was met with a very unpleasent suprise the chciehn itza has been built in askia i insta enter a fit of rage nearly breaking my computer and then quite quickly rage quit the game i didnt talk to him for 2 weeks teared a friendship apart 1010

civilization v is a strategy game by firaxis studios that supports both multiplayer and singleplayer unlike other strategy games i know cough cough starcraft ii cough cough this game does not have as huge of a learning curve to it i was introduced to it at a fairly young age as both my brother and father were avid fans of the series you start off usually by doing a single player game before you dive into the actual gameplay you must set up your game first you are given a choice of factions of which there are many my favorite for the classic civ is egypt while in gods and kings it is the huns and in brave new world it is brazil after you select your faction you select your land type islands continents fractal etc and game length getting started can be tough but the helpful advisors will show you the way there are many ways to win so finding your play style will not be a problem either as you player you contruct buildings to help with different conditions and units to help defend against or conquer your enemies just like the real world world wonders of all different varieties can be constructed for your empire as well however only one of each may exist there are many as well ranging anywhere from the great wall of china to the big ben the different victory types are diplomatic cultural domination science and time i personally have only won twice with both victories being cultural as egypt and rome in addition there is endless replayability with the many different world types and civilizations to choose from gameplay is endless you will be investing hundreds if not thousands of hours on this game i assure you multiplayer is something to brag about as well i have never had a better time anywhere than playing with friends on civilization v there are two expansions to this game gods and kings and brave new world each of these expansions are worth every penny in the end this game is spectacular and one of my all time favorites if you can afford it pick it up immediatly or if you dont have the cash wait for a sale and then do yourself the favor this game and all of its expansions combined earns a 95100 from me fantastic amazing superb get it

i overlooked this game so many times until i bought it when it was on sale to play with some friends and it is one of the only strategy games i like as more of an action rpg kinda player going in to civ was a strange experience but around the 1 play time mark i was hooked i didnt want the session to end these games can be played for a while left for a week and then come back to so actual matches as ill call them can last weeks some friends and i have been playing one match for about 2 months now as for the game itself i found it best from a casual point of view one of those games where you can get together with friends and just play civ can also be very intense at some points with decisions to side with friends or kill them or side with them and when your contracts run out just completely  them over so in conclusion buy this game friends or not this game is extremely fun for both casual and competitive players

well you can see by my hrs logged what i think about this titlenuff said

honestly one of the few games out there that has managed to hold my attention for 1000 hours with each expansion the game has become more rounded and fun each in turn smoothing off the rough edges of its predecessor whilst purists say that civ iv is superior the one unit per hex rule of civ v is what gives this iteration the edge for me
recommended
this game is actually fantastic very entertaining keeps me engaged for hours fun to play with friends too
recommended
although the game is longwinded and takes a while to play civ v is a very fun game for multiplayer and a good time spender when your bored as st nuke them all  nuff said 910

not a bad game when it actually starts so long as you never try multiplayer
recommended
my god this game is exetremely addicting and takes such a long time but it is such a amazing game that you dont care how much time it takes
recommended
an extensive and deep strategy game that is easy to learn and consistently fun a large array of content enhanced by numerous dlc packs a blast with friends singleplayer can drag over time relaxing in times of peace and thrilling in war
recommended
pro  full potential of trade is elegantly subtle  realworld economic cooperation  science religious influences and some cultural effects  achievements  steam cloud  multiplay  nuclear arms  spies missions  vote in the united nations  besides religion and espionage gods and kings adds a bevy of new units buildings wonders and civilizations to play contra  dlc for $ conclusion probably one of the biggest changes is brave new worlds inclusion of trade routes

wonderful game be prepared to put allot of time in this game my parting words are never trust ghandi or genghis khan

what if civilization had lyrics theres a game called civilization where you get your own little nation be immortal ruler as you see fit with just one click and you can decree  from civ 1 to civ revolution its your job to find the solution need advice from somebody wiser just ask elvis hes your advisor everybody thinks youre nobody important if this were fight club yould be edward norton a gimp a geek a shrimp they call you weak they call you wimp so lame little do they know that youre a man of power you can conquer people hour after hour theyd fear you if they lived in the borders of your civ so keep playing civilization take good care of your little nation start a war with ancient egyptians spread your equally valid religion win with science culture or napalm watch out ghandi might drop the abomb you can show your neighbors you love them or just beat the dog out of them when youre playing civilization history becomes your creation learn to write before you can read and build the taj mahal right in cleveland keep your wits and your sence of humor watch out for that prick montezuma hes a  bag you can change the future a lotsee you can even make jewish nazis civilization is the bomb i hope they dont drop the ball when they bring it to facebook

civilization v is a great game i am not the best at it but i have fun playing it especially with friends this is a good game to play with friends or alone and once you start playing you tend to forget what time it is until you really need to get off i myself really enjoy this game and sometimes i never notice how fast time goes by i may spend up to six to seven hours a day on this game this game is not just for gamers who enjoy strategy games but i my opinion it is a game for anyone who just want to mess around with friends
recommended
i respected and admired the man known as mahatma gandhi before playing this game when i first found him in my one of my playthroughs i was overjoyed as he continued to give me gifts of gold and luxuries he asked passage through my lands and i gladly accepted what happened next was the game fallout as i now despise the man named gandhi 1110 gandhi hating simulator 2015

civilization 5 is my favourite game because it offers an endless amount of playtime every time i play its different so i keep coming back because it always offers something new learning how to play may take a few games but once you understand the basics theres no going back on top of all that is the steam workshop which offers so much more to explore from modded civilizations to different game play plus it helps that its addictive

one unit per tile makes combat much better while turn times are awfully long as long as i play on smaller than average maps its not too bothersome though and its a great game nonetheless

if you have ever wanted to have complete control of an empire diplomatically culturally or even with brute force civ 5 is the game for you it features 30 different civilizations all with their own unique look to play as if you manage to buy the gold edition you can easily sink in 56 hours like i did whenever i started the game because its not mentally possible to stop until you conclude the fate of your civilization hopefully this convinces you to buy the game as soon as possible  christian

a crazy addictive game that will have you playing day after day to refine your play style and skill truly a great game and a big improvement on the last game in my opinion this is the sort of game that you could leave for a few months and come back to and still enjoy tones of replayability and enough options to make each game completely unique 910

this game is the best its a 1010 except for the time you will spend playing it 11pm turns into 4in the morning before you know it i was so into today that i forgot today was my friends birthdayoppps cant wait for the new one

there are two types of people in this world  those who dislike civ and those who buy the game and lose the next 16 hours of their life clicking on the next turn button as a 4x game civ does it all economics diplomacy strategy empire macromanagement city micromanagement religious disputes etc and it does all of it in an immersive attractive environment that progresses with the state of your civilization the only real cons are that public multiplayer games take forever without a good method for pausingsavingresuming but this can be remedied by joining a civ steam group or just playing with friends at the very least give the brave new world demo a try and find out how expendable your sleep is

civilization v is by far my favorite game i have ever encountered for starters you can play from a large range of historical civilizations such as the romans egyptians ottomans mongolians and japanese each one of these civs are unique since each gets a bonus to help in the game example  persia has a longer golden age  romans build buildings faster the graphics are extremely good considering this is game from 2010 a few glitches here and there with the tiles not showing up or fps drop when scrolling through the world what can you do  you can be militeristic take over the world with an iron fist and create an empire you can be a cultural nation only having a few cities and being peaceful with fellow nations the game is extremely fair no nation has over powered bonuses to give them a boost during the game a lot of strategy is needed if you wish to succeed in winning you cant just create a large army and not expect any consequences civs large selection of maps is also amazing you can play on earth with america europe asia africa and the middle east each having realistic minerals inside them middle east has oil america has gold in the west aswell as islands and pangaea hope im spelling it right c now for the problems of the game none of these should scare you away from buying this masterpiece though 1 civs will randomly denounce you even if you havent attacked anyone 2 adding on to civs doing random things they sometimes will declare war on you for no reason somewhat rare tough 3 lagging & fps drop nothing to overly concern about but the farther you get into the game the laggier it gets with all of the cities and units thats really all of the problems ive encountered others might have seen more i recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy turn based games its seriously one of the best strategy games out there today defiantly worth the money 9010 ignore possible grammarspelling mistakes
recommended
this game lets you choose how you want to progress as a civilization whether you choose to relay on scientific research to develop more efficient mechanisms or you want to build a huge powerful army to eliminate the competition civilization 5 seems like itd be boring and a waste but i found it engaging the freedom of how you progress and solve problems is definately a plus i like it

with countless civilizations at your fingertips to begin on a journey through time there is no doubt that civilization v will have you playing for hours on end > with various different game speeds there is a choice to suit most be it standard quick or marathon game times > multiplayer works very well but is known to have a few minor issues from time to time which are easily fixed through restarts > single player is also done to a great standard there are many bot difficulties availabe for the freshfaced beginner to the experienced > the games tutorials are very helpful and guide you through what needs to be done however it is worth noting you dont have to follow the advisors it is your civ after all > the animations and details put into the game means it is quite visually impressive you can easily make out and enjoy the various landscapes > there is a strategic view for those who want to concerntrate purely on the game mechanics and systems > combat works nicely however multiplayer works on a first  to  move basis which can be marginally annoying is the game mechanics complex at first the game may seem a bit daunting to a first time player however you quickly pick up options quite easily you will start to notice that the game almost runs on repeats all in all civ v is a great game for those looking for that earthly turn based strategy 3  kalnder

great game with endless replay possibilities a nice step up from the previous version but civ2 will always be my favorite as it introduced me to the series a little too heavy on the dlc for comfort although they do add some nice additions once you have grown accustomed to the vanilla version like civ2 plan on setting aside many late nights saying to yourself just one more turn

50 hours into your latest save all is going well only 3 leaders left gandhi caesar and washington you draft an end game plan in your mind you will make friends with gandhi for obvious reasons hes chill then procede to befriend caesar then you will take out washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior he must pay 20 turns later all is going to plan we are now on washingtons doorstep gandhi and caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation all we need to do is eliminate the pesky americans and ith all our military now on american soil this should not take long then after the swift invasion of america we will make a vote for world peace at the un in rome of course with our new found indian and roman brethren it is a sure win but all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start quickly they become louder and louder what is this you think to yourself a false alarm you shrug it off maybe caesae bombing a city state the game pauses gandhi appears on the screen with a sinister grin he shouts war in your face only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight the camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy the capital of your glorious nation you then hear a rumble just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine you realise it is too late you can only watch as the missle closes in as your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people then silence before what had just occurred had sunk in before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears suddenly countless stealth bombers appear seemingly out of no where soon the sky is blackened by planes the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains you faint from the shock of what is unfolding you awake shortly after gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire now with giant death robots making the most of his seemingly never ending turn as gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes whats left of your broken nation all you can do is weep your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn why oh why did you turn of autosave did it really speed your game up was it worth it ghandi is a complete  he acts like your friend but will nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself 1010

i am the peaceful nation of the celts we shall be the nation of religion and of diplomacy this went well we ended up next to the babylonians and we expanded nicely in peace however i have always believed in dibs so i placed down glasgow onto the land between us to provide a little buffer they seemed annoyed by this a few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years but otherwise nothing too bad happened in order to spread our religion further because we were known for our confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster we begin to invest in boats soon we covered the oceans in missionaries inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies babylon was making friends with a local city state genoa however they were trying to spread zoroastrianism those heathens despite both our religions being known for their peace we passiveaggressively sent missionary and inquisitor to genoa over the course of about 700 years we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions those same warriors had been given spears now but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders i offer babylon some sugar for their spice they wanted my sugar iron coal and all of my money i then asked germany if they wanted sugar for spice they accepted north of me rome had begun a war with france due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade i found myself with a huge amount of money everytime france and rome made peace i knew that rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes so i bought i gifted many city states my religion and gold and then i bought gifted france and germany enough money to declare with with rome while they fought my spearmen now musketmen continued to glare with babylons and we continued our 1500 year religious passiveaggression over genoa they said i was spying on them i said i wouldnt when my spies returned i sent them back to babylon a squad of 5 great prophets charged into babylon converting left right and centre babylon complained i was being a bit aggressive i apologised i then sent more missionaries to babylon i had now found every single civilization we decided to have a united nations meeting in 1600ad i as the host gave everyone a single vote except myself i gave myself 16 due to my popularity i declared my religion to be the world religion every one opposed i listened to their opinions and then passed it anyway when rome got angry about this i then paid france to declare war again when babylon got angry i then paid rome to declare war on them my civilians were amazingly happy hugely more than any other place but because i was an emperor they declared me declis the terrible despite my universal healthcare happy citizens peaceful religion not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word my army consisted of mostly my friends my city states and my musketmen now great war infantry continued to glare at the babylonian great war infantry after 2000 years a great duty to my nation their descendants shall continue to frown at the babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall eventually we reached a grand united nations meeting i sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 city state friends and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side i said that the peoples confucian republican empire of scotland was the best nation in the world they all voted against me i smiled and then declared i won anyway democracy is overrated freedom of religion only applies to my religion i dont need to be stronger when im more popular and my people are probably more beautiful and if you dont like me ill pay your best friend to backstab you through this i came to understand american foreign policy so civilization is if nothing else an educational tool

if your into turned based strategy look no further civ has been around a long time and civ 5 is well vetted it had a bit of a rocky start with the vannilla but the first expansion is awsome
recommended
never see the sun again
recommended
this is a great turnbased game its really fun i would recommend that you play it
recommended
ive played a bit its ok i guess 1010
recommended
this game is fun i mean really fun you start as a insignificant civilization in 4000 bc and work your way up to a global super power in 2050 ad since i own the complete edition the vast amount of civilizations of which there are 43 more with mods i play as the americans most of the time and the fact that one wrong move can lead to your downfall is very interesting while the game is fun with all expansion packs and dlc the game gets better with mods you can download those in the workshop the game will look extremely boring to a normal person but try it youll be glad you did pros 43 civs whole lotta choices more wonders never will building the eiffel tower feel so good a social policy system better than civ 4 adopt social policies to enhance your empire and actually keep them espionage is improved spy on your foes and see what they are planning within the click of a button loadsa mods over 4000 of them they have america did i mention they have america cons none expect me or someone else to make a mod based on sonic the hedgehogs nation the united federation

civ v is amazing awesome animations and hours and hours can be put into one single game requires srategy
recommended
i cannot play as sid meier do not be fooled
recommended
english honestly the best stratigy game i have ever played there are a lot of different leaders scenarios maps and game modes to choose from furthermore there is a huge range of mods on the steam community and the internet which help to make a great game even better multiplayer mode is also a briliant addition and is really fun to play with several people however the largest let down with this game is the in ability to use mods online as it would be great to play out scenarios such as the american civl war with me playing as the british and one of my american friends playing as the americans

great game and kills time too fast that you forget everything but cool thing is you dont feel like  or your brain feels like toasted this just keeps you even fresher and is so not tiring but i think dlcs could have been cheaper

i hope you dont have a life because with this game your going to forget you had one civilization is a srategy game where you command your cilivilzation by build cities going to war and trying to dominate your enemy or going to the moon any many other things you can do when you play this game this is one of the funniest and most time consuming games i have ever played and it is worth the price and the amazing dlc that lets you make trade routes with other civs out there or even creating your own religion to spread faith across the globe and gives you many more civlizations the play as buy this game now the only thing you will regret is that you havnt showered in days because of this game
recommended
civilization v review with all dlc one of the best pc games of all time pros tons of civilizations to play as 50ish with dlc multiple ways to win not just through war the mods they make an infinite game even more infinite infinitception badass and fitting music for each civilization diplomacy is amazing with bnw and gak mostly compitent ai cough rome ii 100ish maps to choose from multiplayer is great and fun with friends the moments in this game where ghandi wins domination victory or washington dc is on an island cons ai is super ing agressive verdict without dlc 910 verdict with dlc 9410 warning when you buy this game you make a pact with your soul to end any and all social interaction and give up your life for ruling your glorious civilization and making sure others do the same my count is 3 people and growing so far 
recommended
it is really easy to get absorbed in this game last summer i spent up to 8 hours a day playing this game for a while the most thorough game i have bought so far
recommended
fantastic game but im begging you fireaxis please please please allow us to play an internet multiplayer game with mods i beg you to add functionality my friends and i wish to play game of thrones and middle earth games together how much fun would it be to have the war of five kings or the battles of middle earth in a multiplayer match even if it means we all have to have the workshop dlc and its completely unranked just for funsies i want to rule westeros as the dorthraki and middle earth as saurumans white hand nasties
recommended
just get it its quite addicting
recommended
this right here is the best shit ive smoked in a long time
recommended

im 35 hours in and i still havent won a game i find this to be a good thing since similar games are really easy i just want to know why boudicca hates me enough to send every celt military unit to my capital bribes me with gold to give her open borders then proceeds to curb stomp me within 20 minutes of every game

bow down to my empire ahem there are basically two types of people that will get this game those whove played the sid meiers civilization series and are looking to get into the next installment and those whove never tried it and are a little reluctant on embarking on what looks like a very complex strategy game for those of you who have played the series before and havent tried civilization 5 just get this one too theres really no reason not to go to the next installment its got nicer more realistic graphics new civilizations and smarter ai with that said though the dlcs are absolutely necessary vanilla civ 5 was a bit lacking due to missing features we had just played in civ 4 and not featuring many drastic improvements gods and kings and brave new world really make civ 5 a true sequel to previous ones and then some they add religion and more complex politics and economics bottom line if you spent hundreds of hours on previous civ games keep doing so on this upgraded version just make sure to get the dlcs now for those of you whove heard of these games but never touched them take a look at the other reviews on here especially the hours played notice the pattern 100 hours 300 hours some people even clock in 1000s of hours and i know for a fact that many of them dont even touch the multiplayer and stick to the campaigns or in many other cases vice versa weve all started out apprehensive about how complex the mechanics of the game look youd be surprised however that you pick it up in about 15 minutes the campaigns let you take on the role of histories greatest leaders and lead your nation to victory using whatever method you like do you love destroying opposing countries because they share a different culture than your own do you prefer making surrounding nations join you because the just see how happy your subjects are would you rather focus on science and discover electricity while everyone else is still using fire if you answered no to all of those questions then sure fine go play something else in my case the part of civilization 5 that really shines is the multiplayer team up or go against your friends while progressing to world domination there used to be a lot of problems with starting a multiplayer game sometimes there were even crashes however it has now been stabilized and the only issue i can think of would be the long loading times even then though that never stopped us from playing until morning bottom line 2 civilization 5 is incredibly easy to learn the wide variety of choices let you be the ruler you want to be and make sure that the game never gets stale its got a few kinks but youll probably be too busy building the taj mahal in italy to notice
recommended
brilliant game definitely worth the money i personally love replayability and this game has it coming out of its ears
recommended
very good stratergy game one of the best ive ever played lots of variety and content 1010
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is a roundbased turnbased strategy 4x   explore expand exploit and exterminate game ill review and recommend this game together with its expansions as those dlcs add important things to the main gameplay making this game so outstanding good if you like games like crusader kings or the total war series you definitely should check this one out there are of course some minor to major differences you pick a leadercountry for a game and have to reach different goals for different victory conditions my formerly most played game on steam heres why  addictive as hell  high replay factor  you get so much game for your money  every countryleader has different strengths  youll be able to play against friends  lots of diplomacy and different victory conditions  it is so much fun to watch your empire grow  every game you start is quite different  with dlcs there is now religion and even more ways to win a game  many different characters with dlcs even more different characters  graphics are actually neat can look quite nice but does also run on older pcs i guess about the music some parts of the soundtrack are very nice and beautiful but after playing a long time they can get repetetive and annoying so its neither really bad nor good some small things do bother me  i guess this is a matter of taste but i think there are way to many achievements like 280 of em  the scenarios are quite boring  sometimes i feel like you should have more diplomacy options and sometims its annoying how fast another nation dislikes you but i guess this is somehow realistic   battle is really simple if you want a similar game with more focus on battlewar try the total war series eg medieval or rome 1 overall this game is giving you extremely many hours of gametime due to its addictive gameplay and i guess youll easily get plus 100 150 hours with this one rating 94100
recommended
mustbuy strategy game this game when it has all the dlcs is way too addicting and is a blast to play through your own alternate history its way too easy to spent 8 hours simply building up your own empire and then several more in a devestating war for more land only buy this game if it is with all the dlcs particularly brave new world because the dlcs add some great features that the base game missed just buy the complete edition really right now
recommended
its pretty good i like to take it out on the boat with me but there is no wifi out on the water if youre looking for a boat i would highly reccomend the 430 sports coupe it comes with the convenience of a walkthru windshield and sunroof standard
recommended
a fantastic strategy game where you can make your own civilisation and nuke all other civilisatons whilst renaming your cities to whatever you want
recommended
civilization gets mainstreamed less demanding in the micromanagement department but most of the changes make for more interesting gameplay culture and religion are now currencies you can expend  the former to unlock civic trees and the latter to buy improvements both are essentially proxies for miniperks that boost various resources espionage is now menu based and more efficient citystates add a new dynamic to diplomacy and warfare one unit per hex eliminates stacking and speeds up combat time overall different less tedious but not necessarily worse only truly egregious thing was the shameless milking of dlc
recommended
good game good life
recommended
really good game
recommended
this game is great nice graphics and sounds the new combat system is very nice no more stacking plenty of units on the same tile must have if you like turn based strategy games my favourite is still civilization iii but its getting out now with 43 ratio resolution 910
recommended
civilization vs appeal comes from its rather humorous and endlessly entertaining historical scenarios and simpletograsp mechanics that allow any casual strategy game enthusiast to sink their teeth into ive sunk hours upon hours into this game because of it and i keep coming back for just one more turn of this long but incredibly enticing game give it a shot no matter what game genre you like its for everyone
recommended
beautimus gameplay that does last eternity but an enjoyable eternity definitly worth getting during a sale as the expansions are required imo for a balanced gameplay
recommended
best game in my libary 1010 fun strategic and addictive that may just be me would recomend to aney strategy or citybuilder fan
recommended
i love this game civ v is one of my favorite games of all time beating out some really great games its addictive and fun you just really get lost in the world i seriously do suggest though getting the complete edition dont waste your money on the base version and try and buy the expansions later just shell out the extra $30 $5 now during the weekend deal i highly recommend this game i have had a lot of fun in the time ive played it and i cant wait to play more 910
recommended
yeah its just one of those games that you can play for 659 hours swag
recommended
civ v is a great strategic game you can either build an army or put together a thriving culture or a mix of both i really cant begin to tell you how fun this game is ill just let you know it was worth every penny
recommended
probably the best turnedbased strategy games even though there are a few negative aspects of the game i do not find them game changing even though i have never finished a single game i still find it extremly funny however i do not like to play it against a computer and the multiplayermode isnt that successful witch makes the game a bit boring i am recommending this game to people who wants to have an amazing ingameexperience here are my opinions on the pros and cons pros  a lot of ingame opportunities  different ways to play  offlinemode you do not need a internett connection  pretty decent graphics  verious difficulty options  you have a verious of factions you can even play the father of peace gandhi  helpful turturial for beginners  a save and load option  a very large technoligy tree  by far the best civilization game as for now cons  in my experience a very poor multiplayermode  can take years to reach victory or defeat  2 expensive ldcs where only 1 makes it a bit better  no one ever got the time to finish one game  your friends are lazy and will never play with you  you might get  by barbarians wholl  everything you own to sum up its a very beautiful game with a lot of content from a scale 110 i would give it a strong 7
recommended
one time i was playing with 3 other friends on a 10 civ map and one of my friends attacked america and a few turns later he was at war with 3 civs at once with only 3 units and one city left 1010 would play again
recommended
this is the best civilization yet in my opinion less micromagement than previous games without losing depth
recommended
its fun
recommended
this is a great game but i just wish it was less expensive
recommended
well for one its actually called civilization v instead of a rehash im looking at you sim city and dmc so for that it gets props this review is under the assumption you know what the civilization series is let me acknowledge right off the bat the comparisons to civ 4 are justified but dont let that you bypass this game altogether pros nice graphics  compared to the previous entries it sure is a breath of fresh air rendered clouds and detailed terrian fluid ocean live and units soundtrack  high quality tracks that reflect whatever nation you choose to play but can get old if you play for an extended period have background music streaming when you tire of it gameplay  hex tiles deserve to be mentioned as they promote better tactics with adjacent units various options to select from including victory types barbarian spawns turn limits world fertility and map types replayability  very high considering the nation dlc releases gods and kings expansion which adds religion and esponiage that grant passive national bonuses and perks various tech and research upgrades tailored to your particular strategy whether domination culture and science mods  works very well with the steam workshop and increases replayability recommended mods red modpack infoaddict and real earth map cons multiplayer  it is enjoyable to play against or with friends but you can only play online without mods of any kind this includes statistical mods like infoaddict ai  the major thing lacking for me personally i can get lucky and spawn on an island and defend it quite easily using a few trained water tile ships nation leaders tend to be sporadic even with their personalities mirrored to history and childish at times trade agreements can be outrageously disproportionate to the demands being made great turn based strategy game that fulfills what it was created to do
recommended
very great game and have tons of more fun with friends who play as well
recommended
what can i say about this game its confusing not to mistake that sentence as a bad experience i enjoy it a lot at start itll be really simple just go explore and grow your city but late game youll have to multitask a lot doing diplomatic events while thinking on what you should do while assigning units tasks confusing yet fun one of the other fun thing of civ v is the way on how history shapes itself you can find yourself as washington leading a civ directly beside german and you can also have arab found the catholic religion conclusion fun simple yet confusing and interesting to play with especially with friends i highly recommend
recommended
with the two expansions civ v is a brilliant 4x game perhaps one of the best out there although i couldnt say i dont have a lot of experience with the genre an epic strategy game with an accessible learning curve but a very high skill and knowledge ceiling with hundreds of different techs to research distinct units for different eras a functional diplomacy system stellar religion and covert ops mechanics and big nukes made better with friends just make sure you pick up brave new world and gods and kings with it because without it the game feels barebones
recommended
just one more turn and i got nuked by ghandi who said that he was just waiting to backstab me 1610
recommended
very good training if you want to be president one day
recommended
this game is amazing never gets old for me i just wish the multiplayer was a bit more stable
recommended
completely ruined my life ive stopped doing homework passing exams seeing my girlfriend and my family but overall those 200 hours were worth it would buy again
recommended
this game made me want to throw every item in sight 1010
recommended
ghandi started a war with me because i did not give him sugar 1010 would not give sugar to ghandi again

best game on planet sid no seriously it is really good strategic game play
recommended
always did love the civ series my first intoduction to civ was on ps1 from then on i fell in love with it the ability to create your own civilization from the ground up to me each installment of civ has just gotten better including this one i love playing it over and over it can even teach you a bit of history which is a nice aspect plus it also tends to the people who like to blow things up and destroy everything too id rate this game a 9710 only because that time where ethopia and the huns teamed up to destroy me last game dying after 100 turns sigh course it was on deity
recommended
with almost 1000 hours logged into this game i can still say there are civilizations i have not played as and strategies i have not dabbled with civilization 5 is simply one of the best games i have ever played because this game satisfies on so many levels its hard to write a concise review with enough detail all ill say is that if youre thinking of getting the game do it pay for the entire package with all the dlcs and prepare to enter the time machine that only goes forward you will lose so many hours of your life to this game but you will enjoy every single one of them
recommended
so fcknawesome strategy game i ever play will be better if gajah mada have santet army play this right now if u wanna waste ur time 65
recommended
ill admit im someone who is horrible at startergy i usually dislike the whole genre and 4x but this game is bloody amazing i enjoyed this so freaking much at first this game needs breaking into getting used to but once you do its one hell of an experience its just so much fun i spent literally entire days playing this straight there is no story you forge that pretty much with choosing your civilization once you do that you can select the map the time and all these other details are what makes your experience far better graphics are nice and doesnt need to be strong because the gameplay the sound the details and makes up for it completely though i feel as if this game does need the expansions so grab the complete pack because the expansions make them far better if you are considering buying this its worth it you may spend hours upon hours like i do the game is also easily modable through the menu so that which makes it far better
recommended
civ5 has a good range of dlcs and the same is turnbased the game is very good for a long time if you are bored the game is best with friends and very easy to connect to each other i havent had any problems with this game it is a very easy game to play you will learn quickly and sometimes it gives you a challenge the game itself is around 20 but there is a gold edition which is 20 the gold edition gives you bnw brave new world bundle and other things i love this game but you need to commit to the game you are playing or you will lose the game rating 810 or 45 stars rated by mrouldy

really good product ever since i first tried kfc i couldnt get enough of it thanks to kfc i will never be hungry again 910 could have better nuggets

this game is only worth it if you get one of the expansions which i would just recomend getting the complete pack instead of buying the expansion and game seperately i had a lot of fun playing alone and with friends but the online multiplayer does have problems in terms of lag and other problems that take away from the gaming experience

wonderful game fun by yourself or with a group of friends however i recommend turning on quick movement and quick combat personal preference if you play with these options off then the camera pans to a unit whenever theres some kind of combat and it can get annoying p 1010  dlc is also worth it

buy it its a work of art

i formed a strong friendship with the prosperous peaceloving mongolians that lasted for 5000 years before they were completely wiped out by nuclear missiles launched by mahatma gandhi followed up by a massive land invasion aimed at killing any survivors possibly mucking through the nuclear wasteland with a sprinkle of hope in their eyes all of the cities were then conquered by gandhi and turned into slavedriven resource factories to funnel supplies into his wars he used this irrational and indiscriminate genocide to scare me away from joining into the righteous war which other nations were waging against him to stop his massive land conquests fuming with anger i joined into the war with the hopes of wiping that evil smirk off gandhis face maybe i was just a freshfaced leader with a dream but god damn i couldnt let him get away with it i waged war on him instantly my beloved lands were swarmed with giant death robots and infantry but i swamped his mainland with every single troop i owned it was a race to see who could destroy the others cities first i barely managed to hold off his armies and then assisted the other nations in conquering all of his lands gandhi was dead i was beaten my lands torn apart my infrastructure damaged beyond any reasonable repair then montezuma attacked me in my weakened state and took everything i had 1010 would recommend rip genghis khan and his mongolian people 3000 bc to 1987 ad never forget

you ready to lose 100 hours of your life in a blink of an eye the buy this in game 1010 would bang again

recommended
i created a city in the middle of the desert at first i had some problems sustaining my country but i was fine i gained a following as a leader then i desided to start a war with russia last winter after that i bought civ 5 and it was fun
recommended
having not a great deal of experience with previous civilization games i was expecting myself to find this installment of the series hard to get the hang of imagining myself spending hours trying to work out how to start up a civilization that will stand the test of time instead i found the game to be extremely helpful and newbiefriendly like other strategy games you learn the basics then gradually build up a better understanding of the game and its mechanics feeling more and more like a pro with every minute gone by after about four hours playing i felt pretty confident but even today i am learning things i never knew or had any comprehension of in the game the simplicity which has been introduced to help newcomers coupled with the fact that the game maintains the same look and feel with older generations is a really positive thing that was pulled off very well the game offers serious levels of depth due to the vast number of playable races multiple methods to seek victory and the ability to play on completely randomly generated maps every game with available templates to choose from if so desired i have only played a handful of games right to the very end since they can last for many days especially if each session isnt particularly long every game feels very different to the next providing this title with a lot of replayability the ai is sometimes criticised but i think that it is well done in this game with a large range of difficulty levels to choose from ranging from literally zero experience to the grandmaster level they can often be somewhat unpredictable but i personally see that as a good thing i mean whats the point in playing such an indepth strategic game like civilization v when you can anticipate what the ai will most likely do part of the magic of this game is that it immerses you into the position of a leader facing situations where you have to make decisions on the spot with no idea what your opponent is going to do overall this is a great game worthy of your money but i would advise waiting for it to come on sale as it frequently does it isnt the newest game in the world either
recommended
even though a bit old sort of fun in singlplayer very fun in multiplayer i would advise getting gods and kings or brave new world as they fix some stuff liberty being op

this is one of the great turn based rts that i ever played with owning this game will never make you regrets because the every game you start there is a different situations that you might encounter and always not predictable specially if you are playing deity with 12 or more civiulizations to compete the only thing that makes my game hard to finish is to win science victory in deity level its very hard and awesome 910

civilization v it can be said without doubt that civilization v with all its expansions dlcs and addons is the most complete civilization game to date it possesses a great deal of strategic and tactical options but hidden deeper within its hulking playallofhumanhistory theme lay its greatest features it has character depth and charm that only further add to what is an astounding amount of replay value add steam workshop support and a robust modding community and you have a game that can truly stand the test of time i started my civilizationing while still in single digits age wise playing civ ii on the playstation and slowly matured into a more season tbs gamer with titles such as heroes of might and magic 3 when civilization iv was released i had just grown into the world of pc gaming and enjoyed at least a thousand hours of fun through hundreds of playthroughs when civilization v was announced i took time off work since i knew that i would be one more turn struck for several days the music art design ui  everything on the surface of this game is top notch from the sublime ability to switch from industrial production to artistic endeavours to the hardcore build orders used by veterans its all there the introduction of a hexagon grid simply makes sense and it would now seem ridiculous to ever return to square blocks military units are also no longer allowed to be stacked together into formidable doom stacks that conquer whole nations both of these changes force players to adapt to terrain and it requires great tactical and strategic skill both in the short and long term to outsmart another player small issues such as sometimes predictable ai and long turn times still plague the game though these issues are easy to overlook given the charm and fantastic design of civilization v do i recommend civilization v on its own sadly i do not but if you have the coin to purchase the complete edition of the game i couldnt recommend it enough tldr  buy it buy the expasions happy gaming friends

sweet game i loved strategy games when i was younger this is better than any of them i only got this game yesterday and i put 9 hours into it thats like nearly enough time to complete dishonoreds main story on high chaos the gameplay mechanics are great and the game makes you feel really good about yourself when you win a war mostly against ghandi one word of advice for you if you are allies with ghandi he will stab you in the back and nuke you bye maiq the liar

say goodbye to your social life one turn at a time

basically virtual crack
recommended
this game taught me more than school ever did
recommended
having not a great deal of experience with previous civilization games i was expecting myself to find this installment of the series hard to get the hang of imagining myself spending hours trying to work out how to start up a civilization that will stand the test of time instead i found the game to be extremely helpful and newbiefriendly like other strategy games you learn the basics then gradually build up a better understanding of the game and its mechanics feeling more and more like a pro with every minute gone by after about four hours playing i felt pretty confident but even today i am learning things i never knew or had any comprehension of in the game the simplicity which has been introduced to help newcomers coupled with the fact that the game maintains the same look and feel with older generations is a really positive thing that was pulled off very well the game offers serious levels of depth due to the vast number of playable races multiple methods to seek victory and the ability to play on completely randomly generated maps every game with available templates to choose from if so desired i have only played a handful of games right to the very end since they can last for many days especially if each session isnt particularly long every game feels very different to the next providing this title with a lot of replayability the ai is sometimes criticised but i think that it is well done in this game with a large range of difficulty levels to choose from ranging from literally zero experience to the grandmaster level they can often be somewhat unpredictable but i personally see that as a good thing i mean whats the point in playing such an indepth strategic game like civilization v when you can anticipate what the ai will most likely do part of the magic of this game is that it immerses you into the position of a leader facing situations where you have to make decisions on the spot with no idea what your opponent is going to do overall this is a great game worthy of your money but i would advise waiting for it to come on sale as it frequently does it isnt the newest game in the world either
recommended
i loved this game so much d 1010
recommended
even though a bit old sort of fun in singlplayer very fun in multiplayer i would advise getting gods and kings or brave new world as they fix some stuff liberty being op
recommended
basically virtual crack
recommended
brilliant strategy game but be warned its really addictive
recommended
this game taught me more than school ever did
recommended
this game is really fun challenging you have control over what you start with and you can easily screw yourself over getting ahead of everyone in technology is key airplanes vs renassiance guys i think you know who wins
recommended
strategy on its best
recommended
one of my all time favorites so many options hard not to have fun only problem is getting people to stay the whole 5 hours xd
recommended
very solid and fun game fun by yourself or with friends dlc also add a huge new and refreshing aspect on the game
recommended
fun offline game with unlimited gameplay oppurtunities
recommended
great game time sure flies
recommended
japan was my best homie but then i made nukes then he got mad at me for being better the war was over quickly siam got scared as he was the last civ that war was over quickly aswell 1010 became gandhi himself
recommended
usually i wouldnt recommend someone to become addicted to something but in this case being a bit addicted to one more turn is ok my feeling of game completion in regards of development civ v 60% gods and kings 65% it did only add religion back to the series a brave new world 100% i stopped playing civ v autumn 2012 due to the patch they released which utterly destroyed balance now with bnw the game is again playable i really like the addition of trade routes which forces you to build a navy to protect your ships and land based look outs not to have your carvans plundered by barbarians there are some things which arent that great the ai is cheating because theyre stupid your starting position is vital if you start in a bad position youll have a bad time some civilizations are abit over powered some of the world wonders are too important to miss out on with my 25442 hrs played i can truly tell you this is a very good game finally dont ever think ill play one more turn  because fireaxis implemented some kind of sensor which triggers a random declaration of war from your ally or rampaging barbarians which leads to you have to fix the mess at hand as of october 6th 2014
recommended
this game never ends be prepared for huge time sink while playing it at the beggining it wasnt so great but with expansions this game is the best of the kind i`m at 400 hours right now and still havent touched some scenarios yet best part is the multiplayer with friends 
recommended
910 pros pretty much the whole game cons waiting for everyone to finish their turn online can be boring
recommended
why am i still so bad after 205 hours
recommended
its like skyrim with war
recommended
as we all know in 1999 montezuma and george washington fought each other with nukes both at the age of 3000
recommended
fun turnbased game that allows you to pick what country you want to play as to dominate in multiple ways military is my personal favorite but there are ways like culture and science
recommended
amazing game i can easily see how i could dump at least 40 hours into it before having fully explored the game it is very in depth and has amazing gameplay
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
i read the reviews i saw the this game will steal your life and just one more turn did i beleive those claims no i didnt and i was wrong youll realize this after youve spent multiple hours launching nukes at america
recommended
its a good turn based game
recommended
if you dont have this game 4 years after it came out what rock have you been living under good turn based 4x game 4210 would cause ghandi holocaust again
recommended
one of the most addicting games i have ever had the pleasure of playing i dont know how many times ive started playing at 10pm or so and looked up at the clock to find it was 4 in the morning so i guess dont buy this if you really need your sleep haha otherwise you totally should if you like rtss solo or with friends
recommended
i just resently started playing this game and i have already played a lot it is a little confusing when you start out if you dont know what youre doing but it is super fun single player is fun and if youre looking for a real challenge try multiplayer with some of your friends
recommended
do you have spare time well if you want to keep it that way you should not buy this game the turn based nature alone makes you play it for just a few turns and you will keep telling yourself that before you know it you have been playing for a week straight and the putrid smell in your house turns out to be your dog that has died of starvation and your children have run to cps and you are getting arrested thanks civ v 1010 must buy
recommended
its civ is there anything else i really need to say
recommended
the game is easy to pick up and remember ive had it for a couple of months and it is a game which is easy to follow and a game which can keep you playing for a while the only reason why ive had to take long breaks inbetween is so i dont get addicted since the strategy element is a my favourite aspect however its also fun watching turn by turn as you dominate the board to people who dont like slow games this can be quite slow depending on how you play however the gameplay is solid even though in my first game which i think is on normal difficulty it is way too easy since i control half the board and the next world leader is 500 points behind me
recommended
a really addicting turnbased strategy game on building and expanding your civilization it offers hours and hours of fun giving you a rise of plans to conquer the world this game willl keep you saying just one more turn
recommended
just one more turn ill be like five minutes right two hours later but noooooooooooo just one more turn and the cycle goes on solid 1010
recommended
this game is really fun challenging you have control over what you start with and you can easily screw yourself over getting ahead of everyone in technology is key airplanes vs renassiance guys i think you know who wins
recommended
strategy on its best
recommended
ghandi has nukes napoleon a ing crackhead and will declare war on you if you so much fall over rome created the pyramids and america is made up of jews 100% accurate history 1010 but seriously playing with or without friends is fun but you need the 2 major dlc packs the game is flat without them
recommended
great game but i advise you to get it with the dlc because it adds some pretty core features that should really have been in the vanilla game anyway im talking about gods and kings and brave new world
recommended
great gameaddicting and fun to play all around
recommended
the game has good dialogue for civilization leaders the game is very simple and fast paced the tutorial and tips are very helpful one of the best rts with many mods which makes replay a new exciting experience each time rating 1010
recommended
such a fun game even for cats
recommended
this game is the best just the best the only best
recommended
civilization v is probably one of the most complete detailed and fascinating strategy game ive ever played i highly recommend it
recommended
this is a game that is very complex to master but its easy to learn the concept i usually have a hard time grasping games like these due to a learning difficulty but this game has a very good tutorial system as well as advisors that points out to you what needs to be done around your lands to improve it what i like culture divirsity the game becomes very beautiful to watch thanks to the leaders bringing their own culture to the game the character models are very well detailed and features clothing that is appropriate for their time theres also a fantastic soundtrack which will play music depending on who you are playing with my favorites include the music while playing morocco as well as the beautiful i wow to thee my country while playing with elizabeth of england leader personalities each leader behaves a certain way and when you have the game randomized it gives a big diversity to the playstyle some leaders will go for a cultural victory and will mostly be pleasent to those around to be able to cross their borders other leaders are extremely aggressive for a domination victory so you need to build up your own army early on in case they plan to attack you you cant be friends with everyone your neighbors will make you mad and you will get mad with them i have tried so many times to be pleasent to everyone but after a while there will be disagreements border tensions when you want the land your neighbor owns differences on science or cultural approach religion views some neighbors deliberately try to force themselves on your lands by building cities where your borders expand and the only way to deal with that is going to war different approaches to victory you dont have to take over the world if that isnt your style you could boost your science or culture to win over the opponents you can also turn off some of the winning conditions if they dont suit you in my case i think the time victory is boring because it happens too soon or if taking over the world is your style you could turn off all the other victory conditions and force the opponents to fight you good game options find barbarians annoying turn them off dont like the spy system turn it off there are many good options to tailor the way you prefer to play you decide what to do youre not forced into anything you could put your focus on military expanding your lands upping your culture basically it is up to you some games i have not focused on winning overall but getting revenge on an opponent that has been a thorn in the side what i dislike others leaders usually have resource advantage theres no way to know where some resources exist until very late in the game its very frustrating to have played 300 turns and then realize all your neighbors have access to uranium but you dont because that resource was placed near all their starting cities it allows them to use nuclear weapon on you but you cant use it on them unless you can convince them to trade it with you which leads me to other leaders are cheapskates whenever the other leaders make trade offers with you they offer 1 gold for a rare resource they dont have when you want a rare resource from them they expect you to give all your other luxury resources what gives sometimes you can trade luxury for luxury but they will always try to offer you a bad deal if they can i do wish there had been a game option which would let you refuse an offer forever until set to accept it again i do not want attila to have an embassy in my city because i know the first thing hell do is attack me with his army that doesnt stop him from asking fifty times
recommended
this is one of the great turn based rts that i ever played with owning this game will never make you regrets because the every game you start there is a different situations that you might encounter and always not predictable specially if you are playing deity with 12 or more civiulizations to compete the only thing that makes my game hard to finish is to win science victory in deity level its very hard and awesome 910
recommended
just one more turn  30 turns ago
recommended
a beautifully wellmade turnedbased strategy game civilization v will capture and enthrall you for hours on end even for someone like myself who has never played another civilization game before this game had me addicted about 10 minutes into it and ive played for several hours nonstop only stopping for reallife necessities you create your own world own maps own cultures all from scrap and then try to see and make them rise to greatness i cannot implore you enough to acquire this game note at 71413 some people on tf2op are selling it for 2 keys so dont miss this oppotunity to pick it up you will not be disappointed if you love creative strategic games of any kind this is a topnotch 910 game or higher easily
recommended
just yes
recommended
great with friends
recommended
if you dont have the brave new world expansion then youre playing a broken game bnw has leveled out the difficulty level by adding new economy system of international trade route features unlike in previous versions of civilization bnw is not too easy and not too difficult for the first time in my life i really enjoyed playing civilization
recommended
youll make the choice to play for a single hour then before you know it five days had past and your girlfriend left you but youre on the brink of killing ghandi is doesnt even matter
recommended
okay ive got to be at college at 9am tomorrow ill just have a quick game on civ before i go to bed 2 hours later damn it ghandi you will perish 5 hours later ah  3 hours sleep it is true story happend to me the day i wrote this review
recommended
hours and hours of fun totally addictive love it
recommended
once i begin to play it i cant stop never start to play some rounds when you have to sleep soon
recommended
its good
recommended
love this fantastic game may seem hard at first but when you get the hang of it it becomes an obsession there should be a better tutorial to teach new players more about the game itself and some of its mechanics the adviser counsel is very helpful and new players should always ask the advisers on suggestions to improving the empire
recommended
its digital crack theres no other or better way to put it managing your empire and dealing with the other civilizations is fun enough to make it difficult to put the game down it always makes you go just one more turn long after you originally planned to save and quit theres lots of different goals to achieve which just makes it that more difficult to put down
recommended
great game
recommended
easily an amazing strategy game highly suggest trying this game out when you have the time if anything id give it a solid 9510 i truly have loved strategy games and this one is quite possibly my favorite turn based game besides strategy rpgs if youre looking for a good way to spend your time playing a game this one has lots to offer and is simply stunning the graphics are fine for me but the gameplay is what makes it great the classic civ gameplay turnbased whether youre playing against the computers ai or your friends on steam it is a well balanced game and there are plenty of difficulties to choose from you can 1v1 or 1v5 etc trul remarkable i would highly suggest playing this game whether solo my personal favorite or with friends to give them a nice challenge
recommended
dont trust gandi hell enslave everyone and lewd days will come

i was playing as the japanese just trying to build the eiffel tower and then the chinese and iroquois declare war on me top kek then the iroquois made fun of my puny army at this point i halt my production of the eiffel tower then commit mass genocide and eradicate the chinese from the earth then nuke the iroquois capitol forcing his units to die from radiation yeah the game is pretty fun
recommended
my foreign advisor recommended me to build an atomic bomb 1110 would nuke again
recommended
ive had this game for three days and ive played for 56 hours now thats saying something
recommended
the only game where a nuke wielding gandhi will threaten to wipe you off the face of the planet
recommended
built a massive technologically advanced army and did nothing with it all game later i watched ghandi nuke russia into submission 1110 would watch gandhi destroy the world again
recommended
its kick the improvements from civilization iv to v are totally worth getting this game
recommended
great game i have tons of hours on it the only thing i have to say bad about the game are the countless nights i have lost sleep over just because i couldnt put the thing down tons of interesting civilizations to play as and the maps are always stunning and 100% unique the multiplayer can take a long time to find a match unless you have a preplanned thing with friends which is were you probably get the best multiplayer experience anyway not any bugs that i have run into frequently especially in the single player which is polished to perfection any strategy fan could easily get lost in this game play for hours on end on top of that all the dlc add a whole new dimenson to the game buy it you wont regret it
recommended
simply the best world domination simulator on the market
recommended
this really is an addicting strategy game and one of the best ive ever played it has an interesting gameplay system and a fun multiplayer section while it may be an old game by now it still has the useful replayable feature pros  addicting and the urge to keep playing in order to win is always there  different playstyles as different people according to how you want to play  mods section which allows you to customize your game using the steam workshop cons  ai which can be really irksome especially in the multiplayer section leave them for 5 minutes and all your moneys gone  a tutorial system would be really handy as for some new players it can be hard to get used to overall i would give this game a 910 as while it can be fun to play there are still some features that need some work
recommended
if you like knowing more about history and enjoy playing strategy games then you must get civilization
recommended
get it when its on sale
recommended
wave goodbye to your social life
recommended
havent played it much i guess its ok
recommended
civ v is a great way to understand history believe it or not you understand the importance of luxury items in economy the tech race the need to imperialize and explore the open seas and basic military strategy you learn real city names real wonders and real units  buildings that have evolved the world its also really fun to play especially with friends
recommended
having spent about a thousand hours of the game i can strongly reccomend this game but only if you buy the compete edition i still have nightmares of vinalla civ
recommended
my god what an astounding game at first i would have merely glanced over it eh its just a strategy game theyre not my kind of game anyway well im happy im wrong this game is one of the best games i have ever played and one of the main reasons im a pc gamer this game runs well and plays well with many different styles of victory you can achieve i have spent countless [maybe not countless but quite a few] hours playing as different world leaders and either uniting or crushing the world this game is also deeply involved in history and will teach you much about different events people and locations 1210 believe the hype
recommended
this game really drove the sid meier experiance home sometimes whille playing i really did feel like i was becoming sid meier its hands down the most realistic simulation game since fez ii so it was basically real life at some points of game play i literally thought my name was sid meier so that means the graphics in the game look so real that it makes you feel like youre in real lifefor real thats why i give this game 8 cans of mountain dew  3 family sized bags of doritos graphicsreal life gameplay1 commentary63 directors cut99999999 story dank10 verdictyea

for all of its more controversial elements and related failings the hours ive spent playing civilization v make it quite obvious this is still one of the most varied and consistently satisfying games that ive played to date with dozens of different civilizations to choose from america mongolia china etc each with their own unique abilities and bonuses no two games are likely to play out quite the same way and as such civilization v is a tough game for strategy fans to get bored of as arabia you might seek to establish a lucrative trade network and buy yourself friends using your mountains of dosh as england you might construct a powerful maritime nation and go on the offensive with enhanced frigates and longbows and as france you may instead choose to wow the world with your aweinspiring culture and devotion to the arts ensnaring people to your ideology with that time honoured brand of polite terrorism that is tourism the two official expansions to the game only seek to refine it further with the official releases gods and kings and brave new world both adding a raft of additional features including new civilizations and wonders religion espionage trade routes and an expanded culture game including great works and archaeology in every new game i find myself drawn not to the most powerful strategies but instead to the ones that intrigue me the most its a testament to the games diverse palette of boardgamey elements that make every setup so unique and rife with potential ultimately my favourite aspect of civilization v is the mere fact that its a game you can get really good at by using your own approach this is a game that just keeps paying off as you come to appreciate the finer aspects of tile yields unit movement and preparing for events that will come hundreds of turns from where you are now an essential title for fans of 4x strategy read the full retrospective at my blog [wwwceljadedcom]
recommended
one of the greatest games ive ever had the pleasure of playing a great improvement over past renditions each expansion pack adds to the level of fun and tactics potentially involved and given this is a strategy game it truly does bring about amazingly nail biting moments either in a fantasy world or relivingrewriting history
recommended
definitely not a game you should start up when you have something important scheduled you know like sleeping or eating the just one more turn syndrome will keep ordinary things like these well out of your mind try the marathon mode if you dare the multiplayer mode used to be bit wonky but it pretty stable after the last patches definitely get both expansions for the best experience the complete edition is usually up for 10 bucks during the steam sales
recommended
this game is so addictive i have played it so much and is really replayable as every game is different

i wa having a nice playthrough as the english and i met the french then gandhi met me i quit the game instantly gandhi hating simulator 2010 1010 would avoid gandhi again

it is just so satisfying seeing your city go from a small cottage to a city complete with walls farms mines skyscrapers and opponents and other disgraces challenging your empire btw sparta has been changed to rainierville so now on it will be this is rainierville p amaze other emipres with your technology military power resources and yur d ummm take the last part out completely diminish your neighboring empires or betray them your military is up for seiges and nailbiting battles for supremacy once you take over an empire its hard to stop and i find myself making war plans on who to attack first when your armies surround a city and you know your enemy is all but done for its hard not to smile rewrite history making the zulu empire bigger and stop the spreading of the british team up with native american factions and stop the seven years war from ever existing one last thing the soundtrack has me occasionally jumping out of my seat and dancing beware final verdict 810

gave gandhi some uranium and he used it to nuke me 1010 all jokes aside this is an amazing and addicting game that you have to play if you like strategy you can make your own stories and tales by your choices you can win by war or peace if you do want to buy this game i recommend getting the expansions as they help balance and create more opportunities etc real score 9510

this game is just straight up brilliant if you can imagine it my first ever civilization game was civilization revolution on the xbox 360 which compared to this game is terrible on that game i raged so much from the amount of random loses eg my 72 attack tank army getting taken out by freaking 42 defense pikeman me and my friend called it civi logic and this happened so often often i rage quited sometimes and i never rage quit in my other startegy games rise of nations command and counquer etc but then one of my friends out of the kindness of his heart gifted me this game and i must say this is one of the best stratergy games i have ever played i still havent finished a game yet because i love making new games with new nations but you dont have to finish the game to enjoy it its immersive has great balance and makes you think up stratergy after stratergy to try and take down gandhi as quickly as possible you will also sink a lot of hours into one game my longest is about 7 hours and as i have said i havent finished a game yet on the downside there are some annoying things like some workers who ask you what task to do even though youve already assigned them to make a mine or farm and keep resetting every turn countries bonuses like japans bushido in which your troops fight at full strength even if they are damaged seem to fade quickly and seem to make no impact later on in the game i also wish there was a way to change the city names there probably is i just have been lazy and not looked around for it and a few more unique units for each civilization this is the game for you if you love stratergy games it is a wonderful bundle of goodness that makes you feel like you are controlling a nation its awesome and its definately worth your time 910

this game is fun possibly too fun i loved it really i would turn on my computer first thing in the morning because the night before id come up with a new scenario way id like to play then i would proceed to carry out the actions nessasary to bring said senario to its climax the premice in my mind was to take the question how can i bring about this one specific moment and play it out effectively after said moment i rarely had the stomache to grind through to victory who cares though i had gotten what i wanted but not exactly as i had planned the ai ruthlessly manuvers itsself to victory are you weak your getting attacked bro are you strong your getting out teched sis stray too far from your capitol for an expansion good luck the good lands are coveted by all and any excuse will do for the ai to war with you especially land manage an increasingly complex empire to your mental drugery breaking point dont get me wrong this game is a masterpiece but any egoic desire to win will ruin all the fun just play how you want die learn how to play how you want effectively get lucky celebrate your advantage as long as its still fun then start another one and another and another in short lots to learn lots of tweaks to improve gameplay a game that is litterally endless see if you can get all your 30 second ideas played out over the months all problems can be managed nothing an autosave cant fix  great distraction from any otherwise productive use of your time buy this game play this game love this game and at the end of the day get your irl priorites strait through that sinking feeling in your chest that says my life is meaningless but dont put a gun to your head remember its just a game youll get through this are you a civaholic you could be its that good like all good things in life if you arent carefull it can ruin your life i suppose its healthier to learn this from a game as opposed to drugs and alcohol but those things will get you laid more thats for sure even moderation in moderation go on blow a month or so on a civ binge and learn how to manage your life via the loss of every minute of time you can spare to the monkey overlord on your back do yourself a favor get your video game addiction over with thats what this is gonna do for you nothing will ever be the same

i love this game
recommended
because who doesnt like dominating the world seriously though the game has great ai and even better if you randomize the behavioral patterns and make everyone unpredictable an interesting progression of buildings armies and otherwise and the animation is very nice i dont mind the music either  they chose a well enough melody line for leaders to make it blend in the background rather than clash in your ears

one of the best games ever made bit like pringles once you pop you cant stop kiss your social life goodbye a game takes all day even more fun playing with your mates i reccomend enabling the turn timer though even if your slow  noob mates whine about turns going too quick youll be glad you set it in the end 60 second turn speed civ ftw the brave new world expansion fixes a lot of the issues the original had and the tech tree is a lot more balanced get it you need this in your life well at least untill december 2014 when civilization beyond earth is released

your turns should play like this check to see which tiles youre working and which specialists you have assigned make the decision on whether to buy new units or tiles with your cash or spend your money buttering up citystates or smoothing over deals with other nations check to see how close you are to your next social policy and attempt to decide which will be most advantageous focus every move on a particular victory especially on higher difficulties beware of neighbors friends and then enemies in that order civ v standalone is an okay game but you must meet two criteria 1 enjoy micromanaging city development and 2 not want the punishing difficulty or complexity of a paradox game without the micromanagement the game is a bit overly streamlined especially for fans of the incredibly punishing and unintuitive civ iv if you get gods and kings the additions are absolutely gamechanging religion can confer huge if noneasily seen advantages perfect for the more indepth player and spying provides a rather satisfying riskreward payoff which becomes ever more important near the endgame the expanded citystate quests spice up diplomatic play and can give the game a storylike feel where your goal is to fulfill missions among the grand strategy of course brave new world kicks the complexity up a notch but cannot be as strongly recommended bnw adds trade routes a lovely dangerous system which can make barbarians even more infuriating and totally revamps the culture victory the best part of the expansion is an improved ui which somehow feels far more intuitive but otherwise only buy if youve played 60 hours of civ v  gods and kings for the base game and expansions in a megabundle i would recommend this at the price of $40 maybe optimistically $60 if the player is sure theyll adore every second
recommended
best strategy game of all time i love this game because of its replay value and tons of good mods another highly addictive game
recommended
this game is like the bridge for advanced strategy games it has such a complex yet easily accomplishable setup this gives civ 5 an inumerable strength as a game it provides you with over 30 civilizations to play asdlc included each of them with a diverse yet interesting skill to go along with them you could play as spain with a double bonus to all exotic tiles in the game or switch to carthage giving you the ability to cross mountains both long time strategists and newcomers will love this game as well as its historical units will excited any history buffs out there and any game you play in it will always challenge and amuse if you have not already bought this game you should right now

the best game outta my collection atm i recommand it to evryone ^^
recommended
now that ive played over 1000 hours of civ5 i feel that i should probably write a review ive played the civ franchise since civ2 and i think that civ 5 is by far the best the game becomes more and more complex especially with the expansion packs and there are still a number of scenerios that i have barely touched the game can be played from a number of different angles including cultural or military depending on your preferences and the leader you choose the mods provide additional enjoyment from the ones ive tried with my system i tend to run the video options in the midrange and have never crashed the game this is using a dell laptop i hope they continue to release expansion packs as id like to see additional leaders offered going forward
recommended
civ 5 is good game where you can become either powerful nation or desperately trying to defend your capital from both china and france be warned however once you enter the rabbit hole 2 hours will feel like 30 minutes and you will waste hours building an empire which could fall so suddenly good game
recommended
dont trust egypt when he says that he doesnt think its in his best interests to be friends

without a doubt the best strategic game ive played so far the options are nearly endless with so many different options to win by an extremely well made game in my opinion

great game played a short time and im convinced id like to play it a lot more not only do you get to conquer the world in multiple ways and in different senses of the word but the road to that victory is eternally customizable runs great only a few graphic glitches and almost never has performance lag the audio isnt bad at all and the sountrack adds a rather great touch smooth gameplay allows for coordinated or improvised moves the entities and environment both look amazing definetely something to consider buying for both strategy and nonstrategy gamers

civilization 5 is a worthy successor and ive really enjoyed my time with it the overall depth of the game is the main strength and anyone that has interest in history and turnbased stragegy will find it engrossing really the array of possiblities of eventual life is infinite and this game allows that presecent to breathe the major downside of this game is the marketing its the dlc concept that makes me mad its a great product but they want you to spend like $100 dollars to get the full thing i waited for sales but still its the same back to the game its good and fun and you will waste hours where you say in your mind well just one more turn if you can find a good sale get this game otherwise i would wait before simply getting the base game i cant think of it without the dlc
recommended
i got into a war with ghandi over uranium or spies or something i dropped a nuke on him he thought he was winning and demanded horses and pearls for a peace treaty i dropped another nuke on him and demanded 2000 gold for a peace treaty he refused and i had another nuke 1010

great game pros addactive the euphoria from a victory and not founding a religion you can literally play as the rasta god haile selassie of ethiopia good interactive with the ai good voice acting 1000 points for haile selassie civ related units diverse range of options of civs to play as arab money as either arabia or morocco the greek city state advantage to show those malakas who really invented democracy found a relgion to pray to the based god cons why the hell did the devs choose queen dido instead of hannibal or hamilcar barca for the leader of carthage and who the  is dido anyway no british civ no kingdom of israel civ ghandi too adictive no animated interface when speaking to the ai when playing with other people the inclusion of civs such as the shohone and polynesia which are hardly even as relevent to history as say israel or britain are overall about a 911 so i would pick it up if i was you and you dont own it as of now
recommended
ok one last turn and i go to bed its 4am after all 10 minutes loading time because of modded map with 15 civilizations and a map representing earth wait bismarck what the hell are you doing i was supposed to betray you later not you at this very bad moment oh it seems your nuke killed a gandhis civilian good luck with that now lets move this troop this one this one this one too 8 minutes later  aaaaand this last artist i cannot use yet because i dont have any slot left for his painting in my museums but i may still need him someday i think now lets see how they will react and i save and leave 10 minutes and 30 seconds loading time what i wont tolerate this repeat until dawn

cool game
recommended
i played civ v for 4 years before i got the expansion packs i love the game as a whole but unfortunately the expansion packs have taken away a lot of the fun that i had while playing civ v there is quite a lot more going on than there was in the original game so much so that the it is almost too much to handle im sure ill get used to it in time but as of now i would recommend either only buying the game and not the packs or buy it all but play without the packs until you get the hang of the game edit it has been several months since i posted this review and i can honestly say that i enjoy the game more than i did without the dlc the learning curve is still a lot steeper with the expansion packs but it might be a better idea to play with them so that you are not confused and have to relearn stuff like i did
recommended
a moment comes which comes rarely in history but we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and a soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance build courage when courage sees to fail gain faith when there seems to be little cost for faith create hope when hope becomes forlorn and rememberthe future belongs to those who believe in their dreamsi have to say this has been the most fantastic most amazing game i have ever played especially when you get the dlcs that can be be bought to go with it a generally good game with regular civilization 5 but the excitement and intensity of it increases when you get bnw and g&k dlcs definetly consider getting this game if you havent already and be sure to get the dlcs

oh this gamei poured so many hours into it its nothing like attacking the enemy sucessing and then repopulating their entire territory with your own population watching their cities turn into your own i love this game negative sides arethe siege units are pretty useless in the early stages and the early units arepretty useless especially the special units which are shown up early in the game because you can barely make enough of them that it matters any because the progress in technology are faster then your cities
recommended
there is no other game on the market where you can wage nuclear war against 11 gandhis simultaneously

its alright

for those who like the genre it is a stepup on the previous installments regarding obviously additional options especially with the 2 expansions gods and kings and brave new world the social policies changes and the introduction of religion options and citystates and interaction with said citystates were the biggest changes in the game in terms of different things to do that said i think theres still room for improvement on additional options you might have in terms of policy choosing etc the economy system is also a bit different from previous installments a bit richer and i think the military aspect of the game improved a lot in terms of tactics granted still room for improvement there but much less cheesy tactics like stacking 20 units in a tile for instance you now really need to know where to position your units and use choke points etc to your advantage much more chesslike than winbymorenumbers some of the different win conditions have also gained more depth especially the diplomatic  cultural victory the mods from the steam workshop are also insanely rich giving you even more customization  replay value to the game lastly the graphics have obviously also improved a lot with a lot more detail even though at least for me thats the least concerning aspect of a game such as this its downsides as usual mostly revolve around the need to have a sufficiently good pc to handle the burden of loading times etc as it is quite heavy on your pc most games also tend to have a midgame era which is quite stale where pretty much nothing happens regardless of whether youre far ahead far behind or even with the majority of the other civs ai is also something that still hasnt improved as much as i would have liked it is either too aggressive or too passive but not really playing intelligently regardless of difficulty level but rather as usual gaining more bonuses to make up fo the lack of actual intelligence on the artificial intelligence part so breaking it down pros  even more tech  social options richer interaction with citystates  religion now plays a big role in the game  more depth in cultural  diplomatic win conditions  improved combat  tactical aspect of the game  improved mod  customization in steam workshop  lots of replay value  better graphics cons  game can be quite the resourcehog on your pc regardless of having or not a good one  some games can turn out to be stale for quite some time depending on specific spawn points etc  could still have improved social policy choosing despite the huge improvements on that aspect  ais actual intelligence part hasnt really improved in my opinion tldr a solid 85 out of 10 whether youre new to the franchise or have played them all since the very first pixelated civilization 1 like myself would honestly give it more if the loading times were faster i dont mind putting in the hours playing the game its just a bit bothersome knowing that a somewhat significant part of those hours are spent waiting rather than playing

i have to admiti was a little offput at first by this game i was familiar with the concept and a very basic idea of how to play but some things about the game seemed downright strange the first time i played the hex tiles the belligerent ai yes you montezuma all of it kept me somewhat uninterested in this game for a while but after a while of thinking i started to understand the game more and the more i understood it the more i liked it it is a complex game and i certainly dont understand all or even most of it but nontheless it is a highly replayable game of great value that i enjoy greatly

one of the best game out there the soundtrack is second to none

civilization v is the epitome of the civ series i know many civ fans would say they think iv edges it out but the additions in v combined with the faithful execution of the core civ formula puts this one on top hexbased tiles make it all the more awesome and the elimination of doomstacks with the one unit per tile limit makes the game much more tolerable and strategic in many ways with the expansions there is a whole lot of content to see and the best part of the game is arguably whats great about every civ game flexibility to play the way you want to play different victory types will keep you interested for mulitple playthroughs and like all civ games you will find yourself laughing when you find your civilization on the brink of destruction at the hand of ghandis army just be warned the zulunation probably hates you

this game has everything a strategy game needs to be a good one it has easy to understand controls which can later on develop into more advanced controls it has extensive gameplay and it makes you use your brain i would suggest this to anyone who likes games such as age of mythology and perhaps starcraft ii

the best turn based strategy game ive ever played normallly im a c&c fan myself but ever since i played civilization revolution ive been addicted to the civ franchise its useful if you want to go ahead and test youre strategic planning skills or if you just have alot of time on ur hands with not enough stuff to do p i give it a 45 out of 5 45  5
recommended
being a veteran in the civilization series civilization v is definitely the worst in the series that being said it is a good game but compared to other civilization games such as civ iv and civ iii this is no where compared to them civilization iv is still the best out there ive been playing civ since 2001 and for me civ iv and civ 3 is better than 5 ive played over 1000000 hours on all civilization games including the expansions so ignore the time count i have here i just got civ v this late november of 2014

i recommend this game 8510 this is my own opinion but im sure you will like the game too based on only serval hours of gameplay pros good ai realistic gameplay [not the graphics but the demand for resources combat engine etc] fun overall for people who like strategy games fun to witness your very own emipre grow to be a great civaiition great game to pass the time im an honest guy so im telling the truth when i say this game is good cons multiplayermultiplayer crashes often and players immediately gets kicked almost everybody uses dlc sometimes takes a while to process turns so you need to be patient a little shocking to see all your work be demolished by a huge war [wars dont happen often but can still be fatal] a little hard to master but practice maskes perfect
recommended
brilliant fun online and most in depth but simple mechanics in a turnbased strategy

definitely my favorite game for many reasons nostalgia civ ii was my first video game fun addictive oh ill just play one game of civ befor i go to bed next thing you know its three days laterits versatile so many different strategies and most importantly it is game that challenges you you have to make tough decisions plan a strategy think about the big picture id give it 4755 stars
recommended
excellent game great for fans of long lasting strategy games do not use windows 8 touch screen its not only completely useless but it also crashes the game so much so that it isnt enjoyable anymore you should be completely fine otherwise though by the waydont trust gandhi he will nuke you so hard

i retract my previous statement and apologise to firaxis this game is lightning in a bottle dont bother with beyond earth this is the best strategy game you will ever play

this is an amazing strategy for anyone that likes this genre of games this game defines and sets the bar for all game like this a masterpiece and delight the games features make you feel like you are creating that civilization if you do not own this game than you are missing out on endless ways to rule the world multiplayer can support up to 12 players i think which can make you turn on your friends or make new ones this game has hours and hours of fun and i wont be able to stop playing for a while 9510 bad things are the cost and the dlc price $50 for bnw

i didnt really know what to expect when i picked up civilization v a few months ago i had heard a lot of great things about the franchise up until the point of my purchase and i was not disappointed when i bought it those first few days were unforgiving i played it nonstop and when i was done with my first campaign i wanted to do it all over again civilization is a turnbased strategy game where you take control of a historical empire and steer it through the choppy waters of evolution competing with other civilizations i love how there is a very balanced feeling to all the aspects of the game diplomacy war culture religion and science all factor into who will finally be victorious and even though youll inevitably get in touch every single one of those areas there are multiple paths to victory you can just as easily try to annihilate every other civilization as you can lead a peaceful society focus on exporting your goods and reeling in cash to be the very first one to launch a rocket into outer space furthermore you can easily set up a game to your own desire choosing how long you want a campaign to last how many citystates and competing civilizations you want to rival with etcetera civilization v is at the same time a challenging game with a lot of depth as it is a toy box you can fiddle around with everything try out new things play on different maps use fresh strategies and never play the same campaign twice and if you havent delved into the vast amount of mods out there hang on the possibilities are near endless with the toolbox theyre giving you i do want to recommend one thing make sure you also buy both main expansions gods & kings and brave new world theyre quintessential to having the ultimate civilization v experience as they add new gameplay mechanics and a whole bunch of new civilizations greatly expanding on everything that the base game already offered its simply put one of the best and most addictive strategy games of all time and deserves a spot in your collection period
recommended
this game has a lot of turns
recommended
suffice to say that i played this game from dusk till dawn damn that only one more turn addiction level to proof that civilization v is a great game especially better with all the dlcs i just love to build up my civ advance tech produce war units and conquer every other civilization out there  there is only one thing i dislike the optimization to make it to the next turn it takes a long time unless i disable animated movements and attacks and the wait for orders option too i have good specs and it stills annoys me to some degree
recommended
i love the multiplayer game play in civ 5 and cannot wait for the new version of civilization i think more things should be added to this version like options to kick rude player by the host or least explain how to kick a player when you are hosting a game
recommended
its one of the best turn based stratey game out there i really enjoy it and great way to kill time or multi task at the same time

i bought uranium from the japanese and used it to build a nuke and used that nuke on them god its good to be an american 1010

if i had to choose between civilization v or 3 wishes i would choose the wishes that way i could get the game and both its dlcs civ is love civ is life 1010
recommended
very addictive its like a board game with awesome graphics i have already sent hours playing and i will continue to do so not many games fully support mods and civ 5 has a bloody fantastic modding community just adding to the hours
recommended
this game is beyond words
recommended
easily the most fun ive had with a turn based strategy game i honestly thought that i had exhausted its fun potential way too quickly then i realized that ive played 50 hours its that addicting
recommended
dont miss out on this great game it will keep you entertained for hours almost every day i have been a fan of the civ series and this is my favorite one i would reccomend the expansions with it they add so many things to the game if you enjoy a nice turnbased strategy definetly get this one there are so many reasons you should buy it but it would take to long to make a list if you want to be entertained for hours get this though there are some drawbacks each of the two big dlcs cost a lot together  the game the multiplayer can be rough but when it works it will be a really fun time if you came just expecting to play multiplayer think about it a little those are the only two things i do not like about this game i still highly reccomend to add this game to your pile of steam games that are played
recommended
if this was a potato it would be a long potato

as a person who normally doesnt like strategy games this game was fantastic simple to play but really hard to master everything looks and feels very nice but the multiplayer could be better with the freezing but is fun with friends if it run smoothly

a classic that would stand the test of time
recommended
firstly tried vanilla civ5 meh it was so dumb casual and weird sometimes didnt like it but the addons made this game incredible both deep and logical for instance cultural and diplomatic victories now actually make sense and are not a nobrainer at the same time ai also got better he still sucks at fights but at least his diplomatic skills became better love the new civilizations added by the addons now this game is much better than previous ones just buy a full one
recommended
a fun and strategic game that allows you to build an empire though time i highly recommened this game its worth the money

this game has added a new element to combat different to other civ games which is the innability to stack troops which i find adds a fundamental strength to the strategy of units

anybody who likes strategy games of any kind will love civ 5 the graphics are serene and the gameplay is flawless and addictive just dont expect it to be historically accurate youll soon find that gandhi is the most aggressive ai in the game never buy the game at full price though therell probably be a sale on a week later

civilization 5 is like the digital equivalent of marijuana and sugar mixed together you just have to pass one more turn you say it will be your last only now its 3 am in the morning and youre starting to bump your head on the keyboard as you try to fight the sleep just one more turn but seriously civ 5 is one of the most fun games that i have had the pleasure to waste hours and hours on it i would highly recommend it to everyone weather this is the first game they have ever played or if they are the most veteran of hardcore gamers the only people that i would not recommend it to are those who can not expend any more than a few hours or just really dont like turn based strategy games for whatever reason otherwise its simply one of those games that nearly everyone has at least tried or heard of like skyrim minecraft or the cod franchise now if you have no idea what civ 5 is actually about then dont worry because i have got you covered here civilization 5 is a essentially a turn based 4x explore expand exploit and exterminate game you always play on a map of your choosing which can be can have randomized or very customizable settings then you choose what civiliztion you want to play as with each having special bonuses or attributes starting with just two units a settler and a warrior the player founds a city which will be their starting point and expands from there you must reseach new technologies expand your deplomacy and build armies to defend yourself or attack other civilizations with there are can be several ways to win a match which can be also be customized usually either through researching ahead of the other civilizations uniting the civilizaions through deplomacy or conquering other nations now dont get me wrong civ 5 isnt perfect and there are a few things here and there that will invoke some frustration in particular the ai or other nonplayer civilizations is very lacking there is little to no tactices in how it wages war unless you count clustering random units at you in random formations its deplomacy is extremely predictable and nearly not worth caring for if they have more troops than you or you are so much as slightly ahead of them in research they will inexplicably wage war with you this happens all the time nearly no civilization is willing to find a diplomatic solution and they focus on bringing down other civilations before brinning up there own now dont get me wrong the ai isnt broken it is merely serviceable so if you dont mind then you wont get too frustrated other than this there are only a very few minor complaints that arent too big a deal sometimes you can get screwed if you dont precure a certain amount of specific resources like happiness gold or reseach you might start somwhere that wont allow the player to really expand and the other civilizations could eventually snowball you or over time the player could snowball the other civilizations easily if they get those resources and then the game becomes too easy but most of the time the game is fairly balanced and very much worth playing again i would recommend this to almost anybody and everybody now if you dont mind i need finish conquering france with my giant death robots
recommended
really good 4x game once you get in the game you will play for hours at a time without realizing then boom there goes your day i recommend getting it with both the expansion pack because they fix a lot of the problems in the game while adding a lot of content

this game is a good game i still believe civ 3 to be the best but this game does a good job i would love to have the dlcs that people demand to make this game better but the dlcs cost more than the game and that seems ridiculous to me positives its a civ game good graphics plenty of options negatives expensive dlc broken ai supposedly fixed by dlc horrible multiplayer setup system

the quintessential turned based stratagy game at its launch civ5 was a bare bones shadow of its earlier sequels however through the power of free updates paid dlc and 2 expansions it become the best of the series insanely deep mechanics with a rich historcial background to enjoy be warned ghandi is not the type to your imperialistic  he will nuke your  absolute classic be sure to pick up the second expansion brave new world it adds so much more depth to an already bloated gametop tier indispensible gaming title
recommended
this is one of the best video games i have ever played
recommended
a fitting sequel to civ iv however quite simplified and more in the vein of civ 1 than the increasingly more complicated and intricate civilizations the oneunitperhex system while cumbersome at first makes combat interesting and more than simply a stackanddrag extravaganza definitely worth it if youre a fan of the civilization series
recommended
this is a basic easy to get into strategy game that allows you to create your own path instead of starting in a set historical point as most strategy games do although it is quite easy compared to some other games but still one of my favorite games 1010 would play again
recommended
you buy this game you plan on trying it out for about an hour or so before going to bed fourteen hours later and you come to the conclusion that this game is far more important to you than sleep 1010 basically the crystal meth of the video game universe

needless to say i have a few hours in this over 600 as of when this review is being written that should tell you how awesome this game is i just love this game it is one of the very very few games i have bought brand new the other one is sw bf2 so sid meier owns my wallet and my time now as for the review the graphics are good game play is smooth and clean there is no story line other then the one you want to make and the mods are amazing
recommended
like previous civ games this one has the most updates and features can be bought cheaply on sale complete edition goes for about $2025 play with friends games can last the whole day or longer

sid meiers civilization v the current leader in the 4x strategy and with good reason it is extremely simple to get at least a basic grasp on without paying too much attention to the more hardcore aspects of it by managing resources and cities much more deeply which are there for those who like more of a challenge civ v also features prominant civilizations who knew through time and mixing these all together makes a very compelling experiences where you can mould your own countries history into something completely different to what happened in real life to this point it is also worth mentioning that i almost always play with mods from the workshop that really add to the experience such as my favorites being the realworld maps so i can spread my new english empire across a far more accurate world after being ever so nice to all my neighbours before taking their land away civ v also looks pretty nice in 3d which is rare to come by and i doubt many have attempted it the game runs quite easilly with the exception of turn changes so most systems should handle it and there is a very fufilling sense of awe in being able to see the details of lighthouses and birds seen in 3d overall civ v is a great experience to any history nutt or gaming strategist of any sort but make sure you get all the expansions alongside it because youll kick yourself over your lost civilizations and features that can improve the game and overhaul your approach to it
recommended
stay calm and dont trust ghandi or hiawatha youll pay for it if you do 1010 30 mins becomes 4 hours just juan more turn you say that becomes 2 then 5 then 10 then before you know it 100

ive played a couple times you kind of loose track of time while playing 7 hours later you are king of the world 1010

this game is just awesome addicting and adorable to watch civilization is a turnbased strategy game where you can play as a world leader of nation or an empire this game has 2 expansion packs who are worth its money the soundtrack is just plainly beautiful to hear and it will never be annoying after hours the character models look great and sometimes also intimidating i havent played multiplayer yet but the singleplayer is how it should be civilization 5 belongs to one of the best strategy games of all time singleplayer rating  1010
recommended
55 a classic for anyones strategic game library one more turn i recommend getting the two expansions
recommended

910 its ok

this game was a big improvement on the civ series although it had some problems it left some characteristic out it was a great experience
recommended
ive spent hundreds of hours on this game and its still extremely fun definitely one of the easiest strategy games to get into but there is still plenty to learn and get out of it two major downsides are that the multiplayer is unreliable and you must have all the expansion packs in order for it to be a high quality game as vanilla is terrible
recommended
having out over 1000 hours into civ v if you want a good turn based strategy this has to be the one

lets face it you need to own this game

civ 5 is an amazing game and i thouroughly enjoyed taking over the world if there are any of you who have a hunger for world domination then this is the game for you the graphics are brilliant and the strategy needed will quickly make you into a better player the countries andor factions are amzing as well

hours of play time high replay ability wont get bored of it very fast overall great game and the expansion makes it even better highly recommend buying

play this if you can afford to become a neet its a very fun game but far too addicting to the point that your first gameplay will last you at least 1015 hours thats only the tutorial i would give this a 1010 but this game takes you far away from friends family and loved ones to the point of no return 810  would play it never again unless i suddenly had no one in the world

civilization v is based around international diplomacy it is a turnbased strategy game that allows you to make alliances or enemies peace or war you can play as various empires from england to rome america to egypt each nation has a couple special things such as a special building and a special unit you can expand your empire by building cities and buying tiles you can go to war with nations to capture their territory or you can be neutral and never go to war you can start the game just after the invention of agriculture and from there you research new technologies starting with things like animal husbandry and ending with things like nanotechnology each technology unlocks new things to build and use for example researching mining allows you to build mines while researching industrialization allows you to build factories there are various difficulties to choose from so no matter your skill level you should enjoy the game the win conditions are various victory types for example you can take over everyone else through military and win a domination victory or you can launch a rocket to alpha centauri winning through a science victory there are other ways to win as well building wonders major buildings from history that each give unique bonuses and advantages allows you to dominate the score board there are many wonders that could be built such as the great library stonehenge the great wall the statue of liberty and the hubble space telescope there are two major expansion packs that you can buy gods & kings allows you to found your own religion and spread it around the world among other things and brave new world allows you to build trade routes and get involved in international diplomacy through the world congressunited nations other more minor dlc are available as well such as polynesia and korea civilization v also has mod support and mods are quite easy to make using the included civilization v sdk tool using this you can make new civilizations buildings technologies the possibilities are almost endless you can also download other peoples mods through the steam workshop my rating of it 1010  enourmous fun with a bit of history education hidden throughout  permits endless mods and mod possibilities  unbelievable amount of replay value  can be hard on the computer in the later parts of the game

go out on an adventure be honerouble get resources build armies and wage war or go diplomatic make deals and get rich you controll your civilisation you decide what it does and it is your mission to bring glory to your people the game is amazing and you can play it thousands of times over and it wont be the same thing again you can play it alone or with friends if you play it alone you will find your self in situations where you say just 5 minutes and then 5 hours later you are still playing this game taking over your next city the possibilities of what you do are endless the nations you play are plenty full and the fun you can have is limitless the game has its problems though it is very cpu bound and when you have a large map upon discovering everything there is almost a guarantee that there will be graphical glitchestested on both a r9 270 and a hd 6870 the ai are predictable they almost always end up denouncing or attacking you even if you are on extreamly friendly terms with them which makes playing with friends more fun as they are less predictable but playing against ai is still good do i reccomend this strategy game absolutely is it worth the money for the dlcs 100% however if you dont like turn based strategy games you should turn around now since this is it it is turn based which comes with its advantages and disadvantages

50 hours into your latest save all is going well only 3 leaders left gandhi caesar and washington you draft an end game plan in your mind you will make friends with gandhi for obvious reasons hes chill then procede to befriend caesar then you will take out washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior he must pay 20 turns later all is going to plan we are now on washingtons doorstep gandhi and caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation all we need to do is eliminate the pesky americans and ith all our military now on american soil this should not take long then after the swift invasion of america we will make a vote for world peace at the un in rome of course with our new found indian and roman brethren it is a sure win but all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start quickly they become louder and louder what is this you think to yourself a false alarm you shrug it off maybe caesae bombing a city state the game pauses gandhi appears on the screen with a sinister grin he shouts war in your face only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight the camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy the capital of your glorious nation you then hear a rumble just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine you realise it is too late you can only watch as the missle closes in as your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people then silence before what had just occurred had sunk in before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears suddenly countless stealth bombers appear seemingly out of no where soon the sky is blackened by planes the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains you faint from the shock of what is unfolding you awake shortly after gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire now with giant death robots making the most of his seemingly never ending turn as gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes whats left of your broken nation all you can do is weep your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn why oh why did you turn of autosave did it really speed your game up was it worth it ghandi is a complete  he acts like your friend but will nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself 1010

i am the peaceful nation of the celts we shall be the nation of religion and of diplomacy this went well we ended up next to the babylonians and we expanded nicely in peace however i have always believed in dibs so i placed down glasgow onto the land between us to provide a little buffer they seemed annoyed by this a few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years but otherwise nothing too bad happened in order to spread our religion further because we were known for our confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster we begin to invest in boats soon we covered the oceans in missionaries inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies babylon was making friends with a local city state genoa however they were trying to spread zoroastrianism those heathens despite both our religions being known for their peace we passiveaggressively sent missionary and inquisitor to genoa over the course of about 700 years we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions those same warriors had been given spears now but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders i offer babylon some sugar for their spice they wanted my sugar iron coal and all of my money i then asked germany if they wanted sugar for spice they accepted north of me rome had begun a war with france due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade i found myself with a huge amount of money everytime france and rome made peace i knew that rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes so i bought i gifted many city states my religion and gold and then i bought gifted france and germany enough money to declare with with rome while they fought my spearmen now musketmen continued to glare with babylons and we continued our 1500 year religious passiveaggression over genoa they said i was spying on them i said i wouldnt when my spies returned i sent them back to babylon a squad of 5 great prophets charged into babylon converting left right and centre babylon complained i was being a bit aggressive i apologised i then sent more missionaries to babylon i had now found every single civilization we decided to have a united nations meeting in 1600ad i as the host gave everyone a single vote except myself i gave myself 16 due to my popularity i declared my religion to be the world religion every one opposed i listened to their opinions and then passed it anyway when rome got angry about this i then paid france to declare war again when babylon got angry i then paid rome to declare war on them my civilians were amazingly happy hugely more than any other place but because i was an emperor they declared me declis the terrible despite my universal healthcare happy citizens peaceful religion not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word my army consisted of mostly my friends my city states and my musketmen now great war infantry continued to glare at the babylonian great war infantry after 2000 years a great duty to my nation their descendants shall continue to frown at the babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall eventually we reached a grand united nations meeting i sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 city state friends and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side i said that the peoples confucian republican empire of scotland was the best nation in the world they all voted against me i smiled and then declared i won anyway democracy is overrated freedom of religion only applies to my religion i dont need to be stronger when im more popular and my people are probably more beautiful and if you dont like me ill pay your best friend to backstab you through this i came to understand american foreign policy so civilization is if nothing else an educational tool

youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter 2010

if you already dont have a life youve got nothing to lose get it already

this is one of the best games i have ever played creating a civilization from scratch and building up an empire so overwhelming that every other seems inferior if you are the type of person to dominate the world with your own empire in every political way possible cultural domination etc then you should get this game personally i prefer to take over the world with the brute force of my army
recommended
probably the best game in the civ series so far i enjoy playing it and everytime i start the game its hard to quit i would recommend this game to every fan of the civ series and to everyone searching for a challenge and good gameplay
recommended
fantastic game its a shame that the base game itself isnt the best the dlc g&k and brave new world are basically needed to get the full game experience which ramps up the price quite a bit still one of my favorite games of all time
recommended
an excellent strategy game but be aware that the hours fly playing it
recommended
seriously addictive youll play for 12 an hour and end up stopping 3 hours later

recommended
great work that worth your money and time
recommended
best civ yet only being allowed one unit of each type combatnoncombat per tile really changes the game from previous entries and while the multiplayer mode right now may feel a bit slimmed down its still fun with friends definitely suggest it if youre a fan of turn based strategy games
recommended
this game is amazing it never gets old
recommended
civilization 5 is one of the best strategy games out at the moment it is very addicting im constantly saying just one more turn and suddenly its been twenty turns although the game is pretty slow when conflict happens between your nation and another it feels extremely fast and every turn feels extremely valuable i suggest looking into the workshop for some extremely fun mods for civ5 as these add much much more to the game
recommended
simply put this game is amazing soundtrack 910 graphics 810 or about the most you can ask for from a strategy game gameplay 1010 the ui and the overall breadth and depth of this is outstanding fun factor 1110 this game can be a serious productivity killer and you can easilly end saying justonemore click if you dont have this game you are missing out
recommended
really fun
recommended
i intend to rule this land

now i understand the one more turn saying that ive heard associated with civ 5 didnt study for 3 tests cause of this game great and addicting game tldr sold soul to devil for another turn was worth it

this game is by far the biggest time suck i have ever installed ive been playing civ since the first one came out on my dads pentium and have probably logged more hours at it than at any job ive ever held not that i havent worked full time just that when civilization takes over sometimes is 24 hours a day for a whole weekend not a game for the feint of heart or those with many commitments and tight schedules
recommended
its civilization v theres not much left to be said other then that if you dont have it or have played it your not a true strategy gamer

my buddy and i were playing together in a game with two of us and twelve computers the game took four weeks to complete as we slowly politically and militarily took over the world together we defeated the celts in the beginning to find out that our countries were on the same continent slowly i amassed a massive navy of submarines surrounding the entire world my friend liked aircraft carriers more so he traded and muscled his way into owning about 15 of them all equipped fully with fighters and bombers at the end of our weeks of play time we stood at the pinnacle of civilization then i got bored and randomly attacked my friend he scoffed at me bringing his massive number of aircraft carriers and planes to attack my capital then my submarines struck in two turns i had destroyed all of his ships every single one of his ships every single aircraft carrier died at the end of it my friend gave me a look of pure terror my submarines had won then he nuked my capital and won the game 1010 would get nuked again

recommended
really good game with a great community
recommended
this game is just like a dose of crystal meth you take it once and you cant simply stop your kids start starving your friends start leaving you and worst of all is that gandhi hates you i just got the game yesterday and i already have 8 hours played on it yes i know im a sad individual it is really fun and it is an awesome strategy game especially for 75$ thank you gabenthe only downside is that the game freezes 45 minutes in a multiplayer game hopefully itll be fixed soon 1010 would marry oh yeah and say bye to your life while youre at it
recommended
its pretty fun and the start of the game is fun and a little nail biting but once you get really late into the game say 250 turns it becomes fairly obvious who is going to win and becomes pretty boring other than that awesome game
recommended
just one more turn and ill call it quits next turn just one more turn and ill call it quits next turn just one more turn and ill call it quits i mean it this time
recommended
fun game to build your civilization and watch it fall apart very good 1010
recommended
i have been a fan of civilization since the second game never got round to playing the first one but i do hope i will one day this is a game where the style and pace of the game is entirely dependent on the player you can play like and take my time in the beginning so i can make lots of money and then engage with the other civilizations either politically or war depending on how they treat me and others or you can go for the allout war method from the beginning and try to conquer everyone immediately or you can try to expand by building lots of the cities there are a number of ways to actually play and win this game but even if you have the best city there is never any guarantee you will win if you are playing on any difficulty the is 4 or above and its this thrill of not knowing that really lets me enjoy the game even with the numerous strategies a player can choose from andor alternate between there are also a number of side activities to do such as building up the cities themselves with new architecture or researching technologies to give yourself an edge via the most high tech gadgets a person can have you can also interact with city states and build relationships with them for passing their borders or getting resources from them and some resources are only gotten from these city states i have put over 100 hours into this game and although i am not playing this game at the current moment got exams and new games to play i will be sure to get back to this game when i have time to do so all in all this game is an allrounder when it comes to playing with your own rules once you start playing this game and really get into it you wont be able to stop even if you win beginners might take a few hours to get used to the interface and the features but the advisors who guide new players through the game are a big help on this part and the tips they give you depends on the setting the player has chosen for them in the options

wonderful game hours of playability

civ v is yet another incredibly addictive entertaining installment to the civilization franchise
recommended
this game is worth your time all of it when theres one thing this game teaches you besides some minor facts about historical leaders and buildings its how global politics would work without morals that annoying inca has become way to powerfull nuke him to the stone age and grind his remains stupid ghandi finished a wonder one turn before you nuke him persia has uranium but you dont blitzkrieg him and then nuke him besides that civ achieves a great yet not to complex balance between research culture and economy although diplomatic options are not the most advanced in the series still a fantastic game that managed to make me play it for over 1000 hours and i dont regret a single second of that time
recommended
this is a lot of fun but be careful or you might spend too much time on it
recommended
extremely addictive its mostly worthy of carrying the civilization name the hexagonal grid doesnt change the game dynamic much but being limited to one combat unit per tile does if youre used to solve your civilization games by conquering everybody else be advised that big battles take a lot longer to resolve and cities are much harder to capture at first
recommended
you can build notre dame in tokyo its great
recommended
no words just play
recommended
ive been a fan of the series since civ 3 sure thats not a long time but i still love the series i highly recommend this to anyone

so addicting

long gameplay but never bores

easily one of the best tbs games available
recommended
this is a truly great game one of the best at times it may be slow but that end reward of destroying all of your friends long and hard work is extremely satisfying the soundtrack is stunning with cultural music made specificaly for civ it is one of the most intense games ive ever played the split second desicions that can affect the rest of the game are perfectly placed this is one of my favorite games if you like any sort of strategy you will fall in love with civ

yes in the vanilla version it is clicking the next turn button simulator 2k14 but if you click the next turn button enough you can nuke everyone including that smarmy jerk whos been insulting you the whole game back to the stone age then win a diplomatic victory 1110

civilization v is among the top of my list of favorite games its strategy demonstrated through gathering resources and expanding your empire reminds me a lot of the board game settlers of catan the primary concepts focused on are very indepth and it takes a great amount of skill to learn the premise of the game in its entirety
recommended
this game keeps on crashing saying there is an error with running it help
recommended
frankly this game keeps me hooked longer than i thought one year later i was astonished to see how much time ive spent on this game
recommended
ive spent nearly 200 hours on this insanely briliant game is it good you bet yo  it is but if ur getting it buy the complete pack
recommended
clearly the ai is this game`s greatest weakness but overall it`s a great game the graphics are nice and the strategic aspects increased with the dlc`s great to play with friends or other human players > less ai and it is very addictiv if you start playing and intend to stop it s just one more turn and another hour has passed or you start to realize that the sun just rose even thought you started playing at night

i was playing this the night before an exam at 11pm i thought just one more turn cause that fer casmir betrayed me and sided with china it seemed as if only an hour later i had taken over poland china indonesia and venice it was 9am 1010 would fail an exam again
recommended
steam wants my opinion ive seen empires rise and fall mostly mine i tried to stop one more turn i will say for 80 more turns then bam its 4 am the world has forgotten about you you have a final in an hour you know the final you said you needed a break in studying but you know what one more turn 1010 would conquer germany with poland again highly recommended
recommended
the game mechanics of sid meiers civilization may be a lot to take in for people new to the franchise but its definitely worth buying and learning to play it takes time but once you figure out how the game works it is extremely fun and addicting ive played civ 3 and 4 as well and also recommend those previous versions too
recommended
the game is very engaging others can probably give you a much more thourough review but i will say that if you are going to pick this up get the expansions brave new world really adds a lot to the game
recommended
what a game brilliant pretty much one of my best game purchases on steam whether you play single player or multiplayer this game is for anyone but be ready to be  you might be enjoying 300 turns of peace and you bullying small citystates but then bam boom butt your greatest ally backstabs you and destroys a game you have been playing on for a while usually this makes me uninstall the game and give a  review but this game is different you are not complete until you buy this game and bully civs
recommended
getting to nuke ghandi what more could you want cruise along and take your time playing this game build up massive armies conquer the world turn based go to war with or trade with opponents one of my all time favourite games looking forward to playing beyond
recommended
amazing game with infinate replayability the game if very fun to play and is interesting to learn about the different cultures i recommend getting into singleplayer more than multiplayer because learning how the ai work in the game is very thought provoking and can cause some really funny moments also the workshop has some of the best mods in anygame ive played i highly recommend getting the ls civilizations mods to add many other unique civs to the game

i absolutly pretty sure im going to spell stuff wrong but whatever love the gameplay and the history aspect of the game people who like turn based stratagy games like xcom enemy unkown would really like this game exept in civ you have more control of everything that is happening unlike xcom i bet some of you guys watch youtube vids on this and look at it thinking it is a very complex and hard to understand game but it is a lot simpler than it looks i have over 100 hours on this game and i have even gotten some dlcs i even got some of my friends to get the game and play with me in all i find it a really fun game and i give it a 1010

 stay back get away from this game once you pay the money to buy it you will download it start it pick your favorite civ after a couple of turns an hour or two pasts by you dont realize the time next thing you know your being attacked by china because she is a  who betrays good friends of her and then try to kill you stay away from this game do not buy it if you do you will go crazy and start to mutter about iron and uranium to nuke china underbreath everyday watch out for ghandi

recommended
great game
recommended
this turnbased strategy game is reasonably deep and very fun and has tons of value behind it as far as strategy games go this one is definitely one of the most accessible learning how to play is easy and rewarding the brave new world expansion is a musthave as it adds plenty of gameplay elemetns that truly enhance the game altogether a couple minor gripes the ai is too easy and on higher difficulties they are only given advantages like money or science boosts rather than actually playing the game more intelligently and strategically this is pretty unfair essentially they are just given cheats compared to you tons of fun if you have eight hours to play a game with friends in a lan setting dont let those conniving s peek at your screen though anyone who loves this game would do themselves a service to check out civilization 4 which is actually more indepth than civ 5 in many regards because in making civ 5 more accessible it was dumbed down a bit
recommended
if you travelled back in time a few years and told my past self id be interested in this game id probably think you were crazy im not one particularly fond of strategy games such as civ but this game has given me many hours of an enjoyable democratic and peaceful bloodthirsty and backstabbing game the base game civ v on its own is enjoyable although what really gives the game some flavour are the two dlc packs released altogether these create an enjoyable gaming experience the gameplay and strategy is a easy to learn hard to master style that in as little as a few hours youll be chopping ghandis armies to your left and developing nuclear fission to your right in multiplayer this game is monopoly with friends on crack youll find yourself making alliances and checking your backs every turn until the game is over you may lose a few friends in the process but hey all is fair in love and war definitely recommend getting the entire game  dlc
recommended
i did play this game for a free weekend so what did i think i loved it i played it for hours and hours so i had lots of fun with my mate it was great

the good news is that i finally slaughtered gandhi the bad news is that in doing so i forgot to feed my cat three days in a row i now have several halfeaten bird carcasses on my front porch i named them all gandhi 1010
recommended
still the best longrun turn based strategy game series in existance this version perfects many of the issues the prior iterations had and adds a ton of new content
recommended
i like the large maps and exploring new territories i love that the other civs are random and you never know who you will run into i became quite addicted to this game and have over 6000 hours of game play the graphics and ai are good and i can spend several hours per day playing
recommended
hours of fun both against ai and against friends great for casual and more competitive gaming
recommended
my favourate game awsome tile graphics and great game interface whether you want war peace or something else thiss game has it all
recommended
on diety the hardest difficulty i used 29 nukes on gandhis army another 8 on his capitol just so i could win and guess what it was a hell of alot of fun

this game is my favourite when it comes to the strategy genre get this with the expansions especially brave new world and you will quickly have 100 hours of fun

recommended
a fantastic stradegy game that allows you to take the role of almost any civilization and allow your to take them thoughout the entire history of time its very avaible for newcomers and even caters towards long time fans its appeal it aweosme it its almost impossible to stop playing howeve the only issue is that the expansions are waht really makes the game fantastic the base game is godd but it doesnt compare to the amazingness of the expansions
recommended
i have lost days and nights playng this game it is the only game i know of that i can spend hours apon hours at a time with no food or drink strongly recomend this for anyone trying to no study for finals lose some pounds or are suffering from a physo x girlfriend and cant leave the house for a few days
recommended
im not a fan of turnbased strategy so i was going to be quite a hard sell on this however in the 50 hours ive racked up in the first two weeks of owning the game im fairly thrilled and enjoying it you can tinker with a single or multiplayer game for days on end and just calmly murder that bloody irritating ghandi in your own time ive barely even touched the available mods for the game so ive still got that excitement coming to me all in all a nice timekiller and can even be played while youre doing other things
recommended
this is the best turn based stragetyworld building game i have ever played if you like turn based stragety or world building pick this game up then let me know if you want to play online

recommended
brilliant game so much fun
recommended
tons of replay value great if you love tbgs
recommended
i love this game so much if you are going to buy it buy it with all the dlcs it so worth it 1010
recommended
in short civilization v is a delightful game of world domination anyone who enjoys board games such as risk will enjoy the strategy in the game i found plenty of complexity in the game allowing the freedom to do pretty much anything that i wanted to do the many different kinds of victory whether it be through a blast of your military might the triumphant noble plight of science or via the slow creep of your empires cultural dominance allow for various options in deciding how you want to win i havent played any multiplayer so im not an authority on that but the large range of civs included in the game allow for nearly infinite replayability especially with the complexityinfusing expansion packs i can tell you one thing though the games are long i literally blew threw 6 hours playing this game at one time and there is no end in sight for that save but yeah wonderful game well thought through well implemented and always interesting highly suggest
recommended
fun game that is simple at the surface but can become increasingly complex in a good way for civ veterans

one of the best games ever madeand mods make it even greater

civilization 5 or how i like to call it civ 5 is one of the best strategy games i have played like the total war franchise this was just amazing and addictive what more to say other then this game should be on your wishlist or shopping cart

hello i am a fan of games such as civ games and age of empires etc etc and i can say for sure this is a good game i have played it for about 100 hours not much for some people but for me it is at first i experienced some problems with the multiplayer but i think they fixed the problems that could ruin the experience buy the vanilla civ v and then buy the brave new world if u dont mind not getting some civilizations but if u have the money just buy the gold edition well thats it thats one of my first reviews plz dont kill me and sorry if i misspelled something i am portuguese thank you

ive played this enough to fully appreciate the quality and depth of this game it is well made an a worthy installment to the civilization series it isnt perfect but diamonds in nature dont come clean and cut graphics are solid at max settings water effect is dazzling at times and watching my slaves er i mean unionized workers hammer away to build my roads always brings a grin to my face combat animations are fun and unqiue to unit types but occasionally they do get repetitive especially when there is one stubborn barbarian using your soldiers heads like golf balls one animation i really think they did well on is the atomic bomb although i may be biased because watching that go off on my foes capital does make me chuckle heartedly i swear im a nice a guy gameplay is exquisite i find especially after the inclusion of brave new world there is a game style for almost any type of player as well as a civilization that goes along with it you like to be aggressive and burn down your friends countryside and country people well the zulus are for you if theyre your neighbour you know you need big walls is building large empires and just blobbing out your thing well im certain being the emperor of rome is the job for you more of a hidebehindbigfreakingcitiesandlaughbecauseyourideologyisdestroyingenemyhappinessandpurposeinlife type of person well you still have a hard time because troops win games but you can definitely be a big world power throwing your propaganda at poor unsuspecting civs with the beardedbrazillian mind control technique or tourism as this game calls it the amount of dynamic things you can do and experience with this game is great and i would say it is defnitely worth experiencing for everyone a sidenote on gameplay is especially if you dont like to build many early units is always be prepared to be suddenly sad in the early game most of all play this game like simcity with disasters turn on hide your workers hide your great people and hide your settlers because barbarians be pillaging your improvements out here interface can be a bit confusing if youre not used to it but seeing as you are with it most of the game it gets pretty convenient to use and the controls are intuitive so i dont see too much mucking about happening if youre getting into games like this this is probably one of those games i would love to play on a touchscreen that i converted into a table top be all futuristic commanderlike anyone else mom just me if youre looking for a great easygoing timespending game this is a great one for that it also has some nice multiplayer so it can be a party the replayability is very vast due to the immense possible combinations and randomly generated maps the mods also add a fantastic singleplayer experience conquering virtual westeros has never been more fun i give this game two thumbs up sadly steam only lets me do one i probably forgot to mention and go over a few things but just felt like doing this on the fly hopefully its bearable thanks for reading

civ 5 without dlc is very fun but once you get all the dlc theres no going back having all the dlc maybe expensive but its 100% worth it civ is a great fun stragetegy game you can play with friends random people or just by yourself there are 8 different difficulties so you can choose whether you want it to be easy or hard there is a campgain so to speak that you can do they dont follow off eachother but theyre fun so to conclude if you like strategy games i highly recommend getting civ lots of fun

if you like strategic and management games and youre willing to spend some time to learn how to play and that means playing a couple of test matches just to understand the ins and outs of the gameplay please get this its very rewarding and deep and you will always curse at the clock because you dont have the time to play one last turn

i have been a loyal fan to sid meiers since i started playing civ ii as a little kid i have easily logged thousands of hours on civ ii iii iv and v with my brother also matching those same kind of hours in game if you love turn based strategy this is seriously the best money can buy civ is the one game that calls me back every time it has the best replay value of any game ive ever played it is a different monster every time i play a new game the only thing i would warn players about is saving to the steam cloud early after i got this game i saved directly to the steam cloud to pick that game up on a new laptop somewhere along the way civ freaked out and now it will only allow me to play offline i dont get to earn achievements and steam doesnt log how many hours ive put into the game since then dont let the 86 hours i have racked up fool you i usually play at least 10 hours a week im probably somewhere around 400 hours at this point and many many more to come dont trust the steam cloud other than that enjoy this beautiful masterpiece

civilization v has transitioned from a lackluster sequel to my alltime favorite strategy game with the gods and kings and brave new world dlcs playing the game with difficult ais or against friends keeps me on the edge
recommended
great game dont have gandhi against you
recommended
you think you have only been playing for 2 hours when in reality it has been days since you have showered and you are on a diet of doritos and ice tea 1110 would bang game
recommended
this game is amazing i have not slept days and ghandi is always spying on you so go to war on him asap plus the mods are great
recommended
while the vanilla version is certainly lacking for someone who has played previous civ titles the expansions are truly worth their money and enchance the game far beyond what the vanilla version is i highly recomend getting the expansion gods & kings if you are considering purchasing civ v it will take the game to a new level without getting the expansions i believe you will feel slighted if youve played a previous civ game newcomers to the series may not mind though i would certainly recomend this game if you are willing to purchase gods & kings
recommended
now civilization beyond earth is released i just want to pitch civ v what i like about this game is the reference to world history with people and weapons being real dont get me wrong  i also like fictional games but civilization v is just superb and if you for some strange reason havent played one of the games in this series you need to pick this one up of cause after playing civilization v you want to play civilization beyond earth
recommended
i cant recommend this enough very addicting
recommended
this is by far one of the greatest games i have ever played 1010 for me
recommended
as addictive as heroin designed during the great war as a safe substitute for morphine as informative as an encyclopaedia but not a very big one
recommended
910 the game has its fair share of bugs a little more than the game should have has only happened in its multiplayer singleplayer i have yet to come across a bug a lot of good strategy in the game with a lot of choices to make i would recomended having an expasion at least brave new world as it comes with all of god & kings features except the scenarios and civs from gods & kings all gameplay features should be included each game can take a while to complete but that is where it gives good strategy in remember to build an army or you will just get crushed all the time and trust no one as they could easily come to stab you in the back a great game i would recomended to a lot of people
recommended
mmmm yes civ v feed my god complex
recommended
great strategic way to waste your precious time on this earth also  ghandi

with all the expansions it is truly great expirence hours go like minutes

its fun fun fun and more fun you will play the whole day and you will still want more siv

sarcasm warning do you hate your friends do you want to hate your friends then buy civ v the greatest hate fuel of all watch as you and your friends scramble to build the best cultural buildings in all of history only to be beaten out by the ai players enjoy the rage between all of you as you try to move through borders and pledge war on eachother witness the expanding nations slowly taking over the map as you are raided by raging barbarians tldr 1010 would ruin friendships

sid meiers civilization v is the game that you play in the morning laying in bed sipping a cup of tea and laying in bed however you will look up after a couple hundred turns and realize that you have been playing for 3 days as i always say if its on sale buy it if it isnt  wait cuz it will be
recommended
one of the best coop games around it is very much a strategic game while being fun all at once you get to rule an empire while attempting to crush the other ones its great
recommended
one of my favorite series of all time this game is what strategy games should look up to it covers humanitys progress from the stone age up until their first starship to another galaxy and mechs the scope here is unparalleled there is an argument that this version is worse than 4 and that might be true however there are aspects here that have improved the game overall the ai for one the diplomacy is much more balanced the hex grid adds a superior layer of strategy to the previous square one and the fact that you cannot stack your units anymore eliminated that dreaded attack with all units tactic i would also recommend playing this with the brave new world expansion which adds several elements to the game especially social and trade and to a lesser extent the gods and kings expansion that adds religion and add to both the new civs and wonders which also add a new layer of strategy this is perhaps one of the best strategy games of all time and is highly recommended
recommended
as a new civ player i must say that i used to hate this type of strategy games turn based and considered my self an rts player instead now that i tried civ 5 i must say that im hooked to the game and its innovative mechanics playing against the ai is alaways fun and the multiplayer experience is fantastic the amount of customisations you can do to the game is great especially with the addition of community content the sound track is brilliant and the options menu has way more options than you could possibly need to tweak if you are considering giving turn based strategy a go i defiently recommend this game
recommended
this game is amazing i started a quick game on a small map with 3 other people 5 hours in and i only have half the map to myself really takes time and it keeps you occupied but it gets a bit annoying in lategame when you have many units and cities and you have to maintain all of them by building stuff assigning tasks when you just wanna kill stuff other than that great 910
recommended
continues the civ tradition of being dangerously addictive fantastic game
recommended
this game is awesome i would recomend to all ages keep up the good work civ fans
recommended
do not buy this game if you like having free time its not a game one simply picks up for an hour or so it is the video game equivalent of heroin it will suck away hours of your life at a time leaving you in a stupor afterwards thinking only about when you can boot it up next and finally knock off that ahole suleiman for good its terrible but its so so good
recommended
excellent although without g&k and bnw civ 5 feels more like a demo
recommended
this game sucks hours of my life 1010

this is one of the most addicting games ever you dont have to like it it just sucks you in and refuses to let go and its a perfect homework game

civilization v is a turn based strategy game in which you control a single civilization competing against other civilizations to win the game these civilizations are controlled by either the ai or a human player to win the game you need to acheive one of 4 victorys domination victory culture victory science victory or a score victory this game has endless replayability which will keep you hooked for many many hours in which you will never get bored singleplayer is exellent multiplayer is flawless and the game gets even better with the expansion packs  also lots of support from the steam workshop to sum it up civilization v is a amazing game is by far the best game i own and i would reccomend it to anyone it is definatly worth the money even the expansion packs would reccomend buying gold edition rating 1010
recommended
the original civ 5 was okay the first expansion was a nice improvement but nothing special the second expansion brave new world blew my mind this is now in my opinion the best civilization game ever released theres extremely satisfying depth and variety lacking when the game was first released without the need to micromanage every minute detail as in previous versions the premade scenarios are varied challenging and enjoyable there are also hundreds of often obscure achievements to obtain from all facets of the game if you enjoy turn based strategy games or think you might theres literally hundreds of hours of enjoyment to be found here one of my favorite games ever
recommended
while this game has extreme depth tons of replayability endless entertainment strong rewards for strategy i cant help myself from building nukes and destroying the most passive country on the map every game
recommended
my computer is incapable of running this game so i have to steal my friends computers any time i want to play it it is so very much worth it prepare to give your life over to it
recommended
brilliant strategy game surprisingly fun and startlingly addictive
recommended
great strategy game family friendly and if you have a bunch of friends go get civ 5 and join a game together the multiplayer is the most enjoyable ive experianced in a while with the exception of a few games the single player still amazingly enjoyable lots of detail different ways and a whole load of reasons to buy this game
recommended
i liked the part where i reenacted the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki 710 admiral snackbar
recommended
an awesome stratagy game for anyone even if you are bad at stratagy tons of civilization to play for hours of fun diplomacy is critical and can determine the outcome of the game multiplayer is hard to do sometimes when people disconnect etc lots of features are for skilled users like the city menu screen where you can control everything the city does
recommended
this game is great if you love strategy & if you love to back stab your allies enemies and aspecialy friends
recommended
i love this game this is the best game to pick up if your new to the civilization series

great game if you are prepared to put the time and effort in

cant say this is my favorite franchise of strategy game im more of a total war man myself but civ v is a triumph of its kind the game features a superb soundtrack beautiful visuals responsive menus intuitive popups and eternal replayability it may not be the best game for me but it is definitely worth investigating to discover if its the best game for you  you will not do wrong in purchasing this title i guarantee you that

what a game hugely reccomended to people who are interested in historical games for me its like the total war series but you can start from the beginning and thats what i enjoy manipulating technology but warning gandhi
recommended
i may be slightly addicted so much to do love how in depth this game is i am engrossed from the moment i load a game

this game can either build friendships or tear them apart

i played this game for a little while and i loved it there is a lot of strategic gameplay and several different ways to win and many foes to face on your adventures

takes a playthrough or two to pick up but definitely worth it very timeconsuming but fun if you get the hang of it highly recommend if you have plenty of time to kill
recommended
its an amazing game if youre looking for a good long turn based strategy play this game
recommended
i swear to god ive only played it for about 15 minutes but it claims ive racked up about 30 hours the game lies obviously but its lies are sweet like the finest honey i recommend this game although its terrible for your sleep pattern social life and your ability to hold down a job youll soon come to realise the higher truth which is that you dont care about any of those things all you care about is getting revenge on that treacherous dog who declared war on you and building more giant death robots
recommended
6910 would get killed by ghandi again
recommended
bloody amazing just buy it already
recommended
its an exhausting game to play but once you have the bnw expansion its also one of the best strategy games youll get your hands on edit i have now played the game long enough to know what all my quirks with the game is i still believe its a really good game for a future civ game id love to see a pitboss mode that allows you to use a shared steamcloud save and gave steam notifications when it is your turn rather than having a dedicated server running hosting the game 247 while it is played which could be months potentially a pitboss mode like this would be even more attractive if a future civ game was focused more around optimization and lightweightness than pretty polygons the perfect civ would be an epic game spanding several months where itd take you 20 seconds to sign in take a turn and leave the game again
recommended
a game that makes me feel great creating the single most authoritarian superior atheist society on the planet while i send my crusade of euphoric intelligence across the planet in a stream of blood tears and nukes all in the name of chairman walrus all hail the hail the master of euphoria 710 it was okay

certainly one the best strategy games created this many years in the industry the civilization series have all been top notch games for any strategist and thinker the expansion of the micro management of cities and civilizations such as culture science happiness and the like all add more depth to an all ready rock steady franchise tip of the hat to those who kept the series alive and innovative

great visuals and fun game not as difficult to understand as predecessors but still lots of fun
recommended
im a long time lover of strategy games but im new to the civ franchise i picked up the complete edition so my first experience was the whole package at once the game was easy to pick up and aesthetically pleasing from the opening cut scene i felt i was watching a documentary it does a great job of making the history of humanity feel more epic i was staggered by the number and variety of civilizations to pick and use recently i moved up in difficulty to the level which the general public would consider normal the in game definition of normal is rather easy in favor of the human players i find a great challenge and really enjoy building a narrative out of every random mission the modding world is amazing from convenience mods to full conversion mods and everything in between there is something for everybody if you find yourself burning out and wishing for a little spark to keep you interested of months of playing definitely check out the workshop content flaws well once you are learned in the game the difficulty needs to be ramped up quite a bit just to give the ai a chance and harder ai difficulty doesnt make them smarter it just gives them an early lead so a high level game is more of an uphill battle rather than a game against a more ruthless opponent i recommend this game and to get the complete package as the expansions to contribute to the whole experience i am happy i finally began enjoying the franchise
recommended
fun in depth game if you dont like turned based games then this isnt for you the dlcs expand the game alot and add alot more to it you will learn to hate the world congress if you do not own it and no matter what you do on the higher dificulties like imortal and diety you will struggle but you will go out with a bang or you play lower level and are equal to everyone or basic and destroy everyone
recommended
damn it rivalz civilization when i snap you are going to be the first to go
recommended
great game one of my favourite strategy games of all time i highly suggest playing this game with the dlcs as the vanilla civ 5 is not as fun as compared to it with allmost of the dlcs perfect for all lengths of play you can win through various ways such as complete domination over everyone i wouldnt suggest buying it at its full price although the game does go on sale often so just wait for it go on sale and snag the dlcs along with it youll soon see yourself spending hours on this game

if youve never played a civilization game before the fifth iteration is a good place to start a game of civlization is similar to a board game theres no campaign or overarching story you simply have one goal and thats to win a match to do this you have many options that involve brute force economical strategy scientific advancement or some of the newer methods like influence and trade the game is one thats easy to get lost in before you know it time has simply vanished to me that marks a good game
recommended
this is just one of the most awesome games cant wait to the next one
recommended
this game has and always will hold a special place in my heart and steam collection it is one of the best games i have ever played and it is such a major time hole that you may start the game and never return to reality

i started this map right and it was me as mongolia and siam and japan japan declared war on me in oh must have been 1000 bc or thereabouts unprovoked by the way siam joined forced with them and they started to bully me i pushed them back and fought with siam which was nearest for around 2000 years before i finally conquered them japan was still at war with me that whole time too although their attacks were infrequent and kind of pathetic but when i took siam down oh no they werent gonna give in 1000 years of bloodshed later i discovered nukes and wiped them off the face of the earth which in hindsight might be considered insensitive but hey they started it and so ended the three thousand year war 1010 would take over the world again seriously though what the hell was with that
recommended
great game addictive whatever all the other reviews say is true at least for someone like me my friends get bored with it easily but this is my perfect kind of game i played it non stop for a week the first time i discovered it i was so eager to unveil everything about the game like the technologies units how cities work everything i was like a little kid learning about the world for the first time i just wish i could find a multiplayer game that wouldnt end after 30 minutes
recommended
amazing game a must have for almost anyone

the coolest thing about this game that sets it apart from other games like it is that you can take a civilization in any circumstance while you are playing compare it to real world history and get a parallel which connects civilization 5 to the real world history geeks like myself might enjoy such a feature whether intended by the makers or not but that is certainly not the only aspect that makes this game golden i cant even tell you how many times i have been awake at 300 in the morning playing this game realizing that i have elapsed about 8 hours straight playing civ 5 this is that kind of game the music the interactive leaders and the strategies you must devise to advance your own regime immerse you fully into the game once you are immersed good luck continuing any obligations you have in your real world life besides the absolutely wonderfully fun gameplay there is a potentially infinite replay value the different circumstances you can be put in are endless not to mention different rulers with different special abilities as well as 5 different ways to win everytime i come back to civ 5 after a period of playing a shiny new game i always get the same feeling i got when i first bought it the feeling of playing an outright fantastic game the replay value magnifies the quality of civ 5 tremendously and makes it a musthave 1010

started playing at 1000 pm played for one hour watch said 400 am 1010

title says it all
recommended
the rarest achievement this invincible in the middle of the game just stop and go to sleep because you ought to
recommended
good game but not quite complete without dlc overall an amicable continuation of an amazing pc game series
recommended
a hugely immersive game with endless replayability i cant say much for the single player as ive barely touched it but as a multiplayer game if you have a solid 12 hours to spend with a few friends its a truly incredible experience of bonds formed and broken within the space of a mouse click though plagued with a few problems such as games larger than small running very slowly to begin with and annoying restarts it still lends itself to being one of the deepest exciting and tactical games ive ever played the dlc massively adds to it too
recommended
a fascinating game with a fantastic gameplay a strategic and very beautiful game filled with different empires and civilizations as i say to my friends its like chess but more advanced and that is what it is as nobody makes peace with the person you are playing chess with for money etc its also amazing due to all the mods thatre very easy to download to the game thats where i usually find realistic mods like true start locations for real world global warming etc and then i play as denmark and go full viking all around the world its an amazing game that one can use too many hours on
recommended
was my first game in the civilization series will be looking forward to future installments
recommended
100 hours yet only played few civs its never ending fun also always nuke ghandi
recommended
really really good game worth every dollar
recommended
its a great game takes forever and a day to finish a game even though you can save at points the maps are huge and strategical planning is vital its very entertaining fun with friends if you plan to have a couple days to play it
recommended
quite a chill relaxing game which takes alot of thought to it quite fun trying to alter history like having the pentagon in russia or having the great pyramids of england
recommended
played 11 hours from 4 pm to 3 am and then woke up hen next morning and played it till around 2 pm so i guess you could say that it is an okay game
recommended
this game is really fun and really historical it was voted both the game of the year and strategy game of the year by gamespy in 2010 in a nutshell this is the best strategy and historical game ever i would recommend that you play this game
recommended
really good game keep up the good work
recommended
best turn by turn based game ever
recommended
i am more of a multiplayer kinda guy with that said i fould this game very entertaining and fun with freinds there are a few bugs with the base game though such as when you send a trade offer to another human player they cam modify the trade in their favorstill very fun with trustworthy freinds  
recommended
never trust gandhi that  has nuked me way too many times
recommended
played it for days never gets old
recommended
this is probably one of my favorite games of all time just one more turn you will be saying that until the late hours of the night so complex but easy to pick up and learn each game you will get better and better and there are so many ways to win so many different strategies to try you could do something traditional with your favorite civilization or do something unorthodox with them either way you can win if you stay with your plan and dynamically keep your rivals in check i recommend slowly increasing the difficulty while slowly increasing more civs to compete with try random maps and add in raging barbarians to make it more chaotic at first i would argue that this is perhaps the best turned based strategy game of all time
recommended
hello everyone im gonna try to be fair on this one the game is good not marvelous but good it can keep you entertained for many hours it has flaws though the ia is utterly stupid which is quite ridiculous because the time it need to process its turns isnt exactly short even on the most powerful pcs it gets worse as the game advances and gets even slower with more civs in comparison with the previous games in the series this one is more simplistic in both good and bad ways i think the combat is better but the game lacks complexity in other aspects in the end its only a matter of taste i suppose the real problem is the multiplayer its poorly implemented in so many ways id need a much longer text to describe them the worst of them is that dlc crap though tl dr not a bad game by any means but would only recommend it to people not interested in playing it online 
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
kind of slow to get into but once you start a game with a few friends its very hard to get out of xd i highly recommend this game
recommended
an excellent strategy series got even better with vs hex based maps that allow for some fun military tactics this is the best civilization yet as you no longer have to put together unrealistic stacks of doom all on one tile to take an enemy city there is no one right way to play the game and after almost 500 hours i still find ways to sequence differently and change my playstyle you can be an aggressive military powerhouse a prosperous economic nation a cultured nation or even a religious one with many routes to victory you wont get tired of doing the same thing over and over the base game has lots of unique leader bonuses unique civilization units and buildings to explore and the expansions add even more id strongly recommend getting both expansions to the game as they add so much that is indispensible to the main experience its a game that youll lose track of time and 1 am will suddenly become 3 am when you promised yourself to quit after one more turn twenty turns ago
recommended
an extremly addictive game
recommended
my favourite game of this genre i can play for hours on end and when im finished with one game i can jump straight into another without getting bored the gameplay is amazing and your experience can differ every time based on the civilization you choose and the ending you try to achieve civilization v  810
recommended
i love this game
recommended
just one more turn this game is near perfection for the rts genre
recommended
great for those who can stay focused for the long haul
recommended
civilization v is one of the best turnbased strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player this is one game that any strategy enthusiast should play
recommended
many hours spent on this great game
recommended
very good game that i recomend for gamers it is a game about history

this game is one of the coolest strategies
recommended
ghandi is a  in this game
recommended
fantastic fun you could spend hours playing it inituive gameplay and tutorials to help you get started the addition of famouse historical leaders also enhance the fun at the moment im trying to recreate the great british empire i highly reccommend 
recommended
pretty good game and the dlcs are a must in my opinion it got a little boring but i kept getting back into it lots of things to do and different ways to play especially fun with friends
recommended
a super intense enjoyable strategy game dont even think for a second just buy this game immediatley
recommended
best game i ever played i used most hours playing this than any other
recommended
its all about the pawns
recommended
this game should be rated 18 it is way too addictive 1010
recommended
civilizaion v is probably one of the best tbs game i ever played the addition of gods and kings and brave new world makes the game better and adds many features civilization v is a 10 out of 10
recommended
really nice game could play for hours graphics are nice learn a bit of sketchy history while you play has a multiplayer version which is great but after playing for a couple hours the games sometimes break and go out of sync and start crashing
recommended
hi my name is raisin and im addicted to civ v
recommended
i was the leader of a peaceful prosperous empire we had a small military dedicated to only fighting off barbarians and we tried to stay on good terms with all helping those who needed help with a small piece of our treasuries then one day our egyptian allies declared war on us we fought bravely and despite heavy losses we managed to fend them offmeanwhile our american neighbors were growing more and more dangerous rumors were circulating that george washington was planning to introduce democracy to our vast supply of natural resources and building a city in the middle of one of our main roads war was inevitable and we sent an artist to culture bomb the border with them alongside our greatest soldiers the americans immediately responded sending in soldiers armed with advanced weapons that my science advisor calls firearms my men fought bravely and managed to raze the troublesome city but they were no match for the minutemen they destroyed our greatest armies and layed siege to our capital moscow then the egyptians declared waragain this is when we realized that the egyptians were an obvious threat to world peace attacking allies what ever happened to declarations of friendship this time the egyptians were prepared and they cut through our defenses like a knife through butter seizing one of our colonies we requested assistance from another close ally the english all we got was a letter saying no absolutely not the egyptians were unstoppable taking all of our colonies until reaching the ocean the concept of having to send an army by sea was incomprehensible to egyptians and they stopped never officially making a peace treaty i write this because i fear my days as the leader of the russian empire are numbered my men have managed to fight off the americans so far but for every minutemen squad we kill 5 take its place our allies have refused to help us despite all we have done for them in the past we have attempted to conduct diplomacy with washington but he refuses to make peace my people grow restless if the americans dont overthrow me they will
recommended
yup lost many hours with this game will be losing many more too
recommended
great game highly recomend it be aware that you will be adicted
recommended
this game is the 
recommended
worth buying at any price
recommended
recommend dont critisize until youve played it good overhead strategy game which involves planning and thinking ahead of the game graphics are fairly good for a game of this genre there are a few bugs mainly on multiplayer none too noticable i cant go in full depth personally since i dont have a great amount of hours playing have fun
recommended
i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in history andor wants to learn about historical figures and events this game allows the player decide the politics of the world you are in and that is why it is one of steams best selling games
recommended
my favorite game of all times is it really necessary to explain why  if you like 4x game this is the reference often copied but never at least not yet beaten
recommended
in the end i got enough enjoyment out of this game to recommend it though it still feels off and gamey  it really punishes you for doing things the wrong way and i never really feel like i can attack anybody until civilizations have guns when most of the appeal for me is playing as ancient empires like the romans but anyway its still worth playing
recommended
a good improvement to the civilization series streamlines the gameplay while still requiring good strategic thinking very easy to lose a lot of hours in this game
recommended
this game is good
recommended
guys dont get this game is you have a life because this game will ruin it
recommended
this is a great game
recommended
great strategy game looking forward to the next one in the series
recommended
luv this game so much recomend to anyone if you love any type of stategy even if you arent into turn based it is soooooo adicting definitly get the complete edition definitely worth it you could hate video games and fall in love with civ v
recommended
easily one of the best games ive ever played i played this game on single player for days without getting bored and could play it almost endlessly with friends on multiplayer
recommended
amazing game gameplay time lasts for 100 of hours and the game improves greatly with the expansion packs g&k and bnw so you can replay again and again and againand again
recommended
rather honestly this is my favorite game to play both with and without online players i love to play the freedom to do what you wish and the repurcussions of those actions just make the game that much better plus its not like the third game where you could practically pump out anything you needed but the computers could always pump out more troops to you no matter what
recommended
this is one of the best games i have ever played
recommended
civ is that game you play with friends play alone anything at all its fun you like it you buy the dlc you then find a new civ that you like great but then you play a game theres something special about it and you cant quite tell what is so awesome about it it consumes you for a few days ita all you can think about all you want to do then you winlose and you feel as if you lost a part of yourself because ghandi is a 
recommended
just one more round
recommended
great game
recommended
the kind of game you can spend hours and hours on and not get bored
recommended
its hard to explain in words what really makes the civ series so special maybe its the easy to learn complexity maybe its the charming visuals or maybe its the huge array of civs units and techs but civ v is no exception buy it
recommended
the best game there ever was congradulations
recommended
i highly recommend this game if you really like to kill time literally just so you know this is a real time strategy similar with age of empires but this one is in turnbased system which i think have made this game much interesting to play and the ai is hard enough to beat if you didnt set up your strategy well the best thing that makes this game one of my favorites is civilization v is not all about war war and war you can try nuke nuke and nuke for fun note this is a game which could kill your real life
recommended
love the game a little bit hard to get use to but its bottyful
recommended
this game is insanely awesome sid meiers is an inspiration to the gaming world i have never said anything bad about his work and i never will
recommended
the game does have its ups and downs like how the ai cheats and somehow gets way ahead really early on but in general the game is a great game
recommended
if you hate seeing the outside of your room and want ghandi to ing kill your  with nukes and tanks this is the game for you
recommended
makes my nipples hard true story
recommended
everyone spells gandhi wrong 5 stars
recommended
i lost friends to this game
recommended
i love this game so much that i want to have sex with it
recommended
this game has no relation to history besides the playable societies in it that being said building the great wall of mongolia is hilarious
recommended
first time playing persia doesnt like where i settle city i got bored and killed him off 1010 would play again
recommended
it is a game that you will waste das on for no real reason it is great
recommended
its fun to playperiod
recommended
9510 nukes and battleships screw everybody
recommended
if you can get your hands on this game with all expansions by all means do it
recommended
this game didnt look good at first but after i played for about 30 minutes i was hooked the amount of different decisions you can make and the fact the game outcome can change with just one decision make this game a very fun one to play
recommended
its alright
recommended
one more turn
recommended
very nice especially the quotes
recommended
most addictive game that ive come across in a while each time you play it youre playing a different game 1010
recommended
this game is emaculate in my opinion par the ocassional issue with playing with people across the pond whether you enjoy smashing the ai or making alliances and betraying your friends this game is one of the best strategy games out there for it
recommended
amazingly fun and addictive splurge yourself and get brave new world its seriously the best
recommended
very fun and easy to get into stragety game the only story to speak of is your own civ is know for being addictive and having that one more turn moments in gaming and civ 5 is no different if you get into a really good game it cane have those moments but a boring game not so much in my opinion managing you nation and interacting with the other nations is the thing i enjoy most about civ 5 choosing to eather have peace or got to war with the other nations is what give this game the one more turn moment the ai can also be challanging at times but can be kinda dumb on lower difficultys lucklly this game is easy for new commers and can be hard for veterans ill be honest i suck at civ before i played civ 5 now i understand the mechanics that to the advisor systems and also help for some friends and that the biggest reason to get civ 5 multiplayer get some of you friends into this game and some fights are aruments are bound to break out along with some great fun moments of working together to solve other issues that you nations are having my biggest complanit with this game is how old it gets after about 10 or so games you have a set stragety for sucess and i find myself doing the same thing over and over agian which can get borning also if your with friends expect to wait what can seem like forever for them to finsih there turns and hear them complain about you when your take too long with your turns biggest issue is the bugs that can be annoying expetictly when online but there not game breaking get this and a couple of friend any you will have some funs times like i said i found it to be repeative at times but still very addicting and fun 910
recommended
if you want to create a nuclear wasteland buy this game if you want to have massive battles buy this game if you just want to watch the world burn from your safe empire buy this game
recommended
one word epic  epic with more epic  i named i city epica  
recommended
if you have no social life and hate the sun and dont want to move for days on end get this game
recommended
civilization v is in my opinion the best 2k game published not only is it a amazing strategy game it incorporates so many aspects which are lost in so many other games i have to date played 789 hours on this game and whilst i have not played in a while that is purely due to scaling down my gaming time i cannot recommend this enough i mean who doesnt want to nuke some random civ whilst they are in medieval era and your in future era its fantastic in every way pros ai is awesome few if any glitches steam workshop wide variety of civilizations many different maps not focused solely on combat and everything else about the game except you arent playing it right now like you should be 1010
recommended
i love this game buy it and fall in love with the power and control
recommended
amazing game good graphics amazing gameplay and a great time killer must buy
recommended
alltime classic each installation in the series has been a welcome change and rebalance to the consistently addictive gameplay
recommended
just the best
recommended
great game has to be one of my favourite games of all time but i suppose thats obvious from the ridiculous play time the two most recent dlcs gods & kings and brave new world are a must have the extra gameplay they implement is incredible
recommended
just  one  more  turn 
recommended
absolutely worth the money  make sure to get all the expansions though they improve the game in so many ways
recommended
yes please buy this game conquer the world it seriously is a ton of fun to paly if you enjoy strategizing and planning out your attack and also being able to see your army grow and crush everything

its saturday and i decided to take a quick jont building up a civilization across europe just scouting around looking to dominate the continent and all so there i am laying seige to warsaw and some broad named attila starts texting me hey want to route russia with me guy cmon itll be fun i just ignored it because i was already busy with this other gal i figured if i didnt respond shell see me out near vienna and take the hint fast forward a few hundred years and its deja vu im bringing the thunder to paris and again attila wont stop blowing up my pocket with i hear egypt looks awesome on fire and what i wouldnt give to pillage venice with you i had enough when she decided she wanted to move some of her stuff into an embassy near my place nope nope nope i said i cut all ties ended all of the trade routes and got my friends to stop talking to her too finally i thought out loud i can be done with this dramatic nonesense and really plow madrids vhole turns out attila is actually a dude and doesnt take rejection well at all

civ 5  the only game when you can play as socialist realist russians against your stubborn muslim neighbors who wont open borders because they hate buying your blue jeans so you tell them to tear down this wall by declaring war sending hero of the people rock stars on tour spreading your ideology and influencing them with a cultural revolution to win without ever firing a shot 1010  would civilize again except it goes up to 11 httpcivilizationwikiacomwikiideology_%28civ5%29order httpcivilizationwikiacomwikireligion_%28civ5%29 httpcivilizationwikiacomwikigreat_people_%28civ5%29 httpcivilizationwikiacomwikidiplomacy_%28civ5%29 httpcivilizationwikiacomwikitourism_civ5 httpcivilizationwikiacomwikicultural_victory_%28civ5%29

bought it about a week agocant stop playingbtwdamn u ghandi
recommended
to be honest this is one of my alltime favorite games many mechanics are different than civ 4 so do your research first in my opinion they are all for the better for example cities can actually attack units furthermore you can no longer stack units civ v now uses hexes for movement instead of squares both of the expansions change the game in several ways gods and kings adds religion and the eversofun espionage brave new world adds ideologies which can become powerful enough that you can convert cities to your empire revampeddiplomacy revamped trade and encourages working with other civs not that you have to the base game itself is fantastic and each addon only makes it better
recommended
you need to understand that when i recommend this game i do it as one recommends heroin dont let the hours logged fool you i have another 150 offline at the bare minimum this is one of those games where you dont stop playing once youve started the turns are so deliberate one miscalculation can cost you anything in this tense albeit slowpaced game this game can ruin your life if you let it but it fills that gaping hole in your heart that the death of board games like risk has left
recommended
an undeniably good game best thirty bucks i ever spent historical reality coupled with endless map scenerios complex and varying ai and remarkable strategy for the playor in both military and domestic and foreighn play makes this game headline right into my favorites category
recommended
it is probably one of my favorite games ever so with the mods i can just about do anything with this this game is super fun eventhough i play on the easy mode i love the game bc of the wonders im a wonderfreak so this game provides it the graphics and gamestyle make it to the point that it isnt the regular boring turnbased game this game rocks 99910

civilization v updates the series to a hexagonal board that feels natural to play on the rich style and artwork along with the graphical uplift provide a sense of maturity to the civ series recommended to those that like era spanning strategy games as civ v finds the right blend and variety to provide endless hours of strategy
recommended
civilizationmy first civ game was civilization ii for the ps1 running on ps2d back then everything was quite good and i enjoyed every minute of it then my friend told me one day that civ v is buyable for 10 i bought it because i knew civ ii until today i dont regret buying this game why well you will see but let me start from the beginning civilization v is a game you cant compare to other games you have to experience it for yourself otherwise you cant really say something against it basically you choose your leader and civyou have settlers and a warrior you build your city you make your civilization the strongest meet other civs you make war you can make peace you even got several types of winning this game beat everyone be the most curtural civ be the megascientist and so on lets talk about the others it it clear that oda nobunaga isnt like ghandi or like bismarck everyone got his own abilities and own special unitsbuilding japan have bushido which makes 1 samurai strong like a whole f troop of samurai after you meet the others the game starts getting interesting you can declare them war trade with them start getting bff or asking them if they could fight with you against someone you dont like but watch out even a bff can backstab you oda nobunaga y u did this to me we were best friends the cities are interesting too you got 5 with the dlcs 6 things you have to look at food production gold culture believe and science food makes your city grow faster production shows how fast you recruitebuild something culture is good for social stuff believe and scienceyeah d you can even tell your people what to focus on and which field has to be harvested my slogan what is a city with much food against a city with much productivity nothing because the productive city makes units like a factory d oh and this games has a f big variation of mods i have about 1020 mods useing right now and it doesnt stop getting bigger thats what she said hahahahahahahhahahaha anyway you can have a custom civ or map or even changnig some things in game its like getting free minidlcs on mass the game even got some funny bugs they dont get on your nerves but they make you smile or laugh you will see it when a brigde is in your farmhouse and you start thinking how your people get across the river or theres a sightseeing tour thorugh your pyramid because your great wall of china was built through it or even your houses fly on water like i said pretty funny look for them d wellwhat else can i say if you look at the hous i played this game you see that i have very much fun with this game alone very good with a friend megafsuperduperultrababoonisticgood are 30 worth it yes but try getting it cheaper are the dlcs worth it of course they make the game much better but really try getting them ceaper theyre a little bit too expensive oh and set a timer once you started you cant just stop playing i started once with my friend at 3 pm we stopped 6 am in the morning and were fast enough to get in bed before parents got us d and watch ghandi he is the pure definition of betrayal seriously if you p him off he will throw nukes at you he will oh and how he will i didnt experience it but enough friends told me not to p him off i saw videos i watch out i dont lie i give this game a 1010 this usually means that a game is perfect but i cant say something with 9 because it sounds like it is worse which it isnt it got some things that bother me but theyre not worth it to be mentioned i wish you a good time and buy this game its baboonastic aweseome your alfons4481 aka [put in current anime character name] [anime]

civilization v is easy to get into but takes time to fully master its an addicting combination of empire management and hexbased unit combat the basic premise is that you lead a civilization from its nomadic origins through the ages youll found cities build grand armies and interact with other civilizations over epic games that can span tens of hours the games greatest strength lies in the emergent narratives that you the player will form as you lead your empire to greatness you will love curse and despise your fellow playersai in some ways civilization is indescribable this is one of the gaming experiences you must try at least once in your life i recommend also picking up the expansions gods & kings and brave new world for the most complete experience ps make sure you set aside a few hours for this game because you wont want to play anything else for a while
recommended
playing to lose or barely survive as a weak civilization in the high difficulty settings is actually quite interesting with scenarios real world positioning mods and ai enhancement mods survival through defense and diplomacy against dominant civilizations creates a different gameplay from trying to win too bad multiplayer isnt quite feasible due to constant screen jumping to allied battle
recommended
never before have i played a game as majestic as this the graphics are simply amazing the soundtrack immerses you in the whole experience and its the kinda game where you sit down to play and the next thing you know its 4 am
recommended
my dad and i used to play chess my son and i play civilization its the new strategy game
recommended
awesome d best strats game i have ever played d 10 outta 10
recommended
awesome game just be careful not to start playing if you need to do anything else that day and absolutely do not start playing if you would like to sleep anytime soon highly addictive beautiful graphics and an awesome community if you havent already check out the civfanatics forum [forumcivfanaticscom] for strategies mods and more
recommended
civilazations has always been one of my favorite games do what you want command armies or grow a culture the world will never forget research technology and race to be the first to build monuments to your own greatness civilizations is a game where every move you make from the insignificant to the vital changes the game and writes the story there are no crappy one or the other ethical decisions in this game you choose what is right you write the ethics and judge only yourself five ramps all of that up a notch adding cultural bonuses and legitimate cultural gameplay at least with brave new world if youre new to civ this is a great game to get started on if youve played civ before this game is going to present new options new challenges and a whole new way to write your story truely a masterpiece of modern strategy
recommended
civilization v is like if risk and a tycoon had a baby no i have no idea what im talking about just play it
recommended
what can i say about this game if youve ever played previous iterations of this game i started with civilization ii then youre probably already addicted and own it for newcomers i think firaxis have done an amazing job simplifying the ui and providing useful prompts for new mechanics as they appear so this is a great version to start with even with the simplifications all the depth youd expect from this game is still there and you can expose it easily the city management screen for example with the gods & kings and brave new world dlc firaxis have made what i think is by far the most entertaining civilization yet so to summarise buy this game if you have any love for strategy and a w streak just be prepared to lose entire days to it
recommended
this is a game you can easily lose a day too 4x games always look incredibly boring too watch but once you start playing one you just cant stop gods and kings and brave new world are pretty much required too get as the base game was a little too basic the five different victroy types make finding new strategys all the more fun
recommended
its great

recommended
i really enjoy the coop of this game my brother and i play as often as we can
recommended
i dont understand how this game can be one of the most popular strategy games its shit im not kidding awful hexagonestyle gameplay didnt like it at all but i have to admit that in the beginning when i first tried it out i liked the diplomacy aspect of the game the rest no so much
recommended
one of the best 4x strategy games out there

one of the best turnbased strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player this is one game that any strategy enthusiast or hell anyone stratcurious should check out

i know im late to the game ha literally but i bought this game last week and i havent been enveloped by a game this fast since skyrim its probably not a good thing because my grades are absolutely going to tank in my last year of undergraduate studies but its worth it im going to drop out of college and hide in a basement playign civ 5 until i starve
recommended
fun to play with friends
recommended
extremely addictive and extremely good
recommended
bought this through humble bundle and enjoyed it so much i added the extra 5$ to get the full tier this is my first experience with a civ game and i have passed on them before because i thought it was to complex but starting from the lowest difficulty and work your way up seems to have worked this far the only negative i can think about except the ais evil trading is that it magically turns one more turn to 3am in the morning
recommended
dont do it you have better things to do
recommended
i beat ghandi in a nuclear war but lost to korea in sciencefml 1010
recommended
as much replayability as tes skyrim witout needing any mods this game is seirously worth the money the game is fun and extremely coustimizable only downside is that the dlc is expensive
recommended
try not to consider realife logic for example how would your jets be damaged while attacking stone age babarians other than that kiss good bye to your life
recommended
opened game at 6 in the evening looked at the clock when i finally took a break 4 in the morning 1010 would lose social life again
recommended
loved everything about this game theres enough diversity within the game on how you play based on your civ and your enviornment yet its grounded on enough constant features that keeps each gmae consistent speaking as a person who has every dlc it provides hundreds of hours of intertainment that i still find enjoyable with my friends even after my 300 hours playing the ai difficulty scale is wide enough so that someone who has never played a civ game before can win on the lowest difficulty yet if they want to win on the next they need some better management skills to the utterly brutal that still can act as a worthy opponent each time also if you are playing at the right difficulty level if you lose its mostly your fault maybe you didnt expand enough or maybe you expanded too much but generaly you can see where you went wrong or what the ai did right so you can learn from it overall this has been one of my most enjoyable games i have played to date and have loved every second of it this gets an easy 1010
recommended
a must have
recommended
true korea trumps all
recommended
i have played civ v over 3000 hours since its release i find the initial discovery of each map to be the first of many pleasures from this game the ability to form your civilization to any victory condition and the progression towards that end are wonderful the only lacking part is that the ai warfare is sometimes simplistic and therefore slightly less of a challenge than you would like at times still overall an excellent game
recommended
an amazing game totally worth the price
recommended
i have put hundreds of damned hours into this game and there is still more stuff i can do in the game ive played plenty of games in my life but this is the best one out of all of them
recommended
pros fun addictive steam community support mods cons online multiplayer is a bit buggy it will suck your life away
recommended
great and in my opinion best strategic game ive ever played 1010 m8
recommended
this game isnt a game it is a masterpiece
recommended
civilization v is a great game that you can play for over 250 hours and still not know every tactic or strategy and youll never beat it its a strategic game where not building that one military unit could be your downfall overall a solid game 810
recommended
denouncing simulator 1010
recommended
highly addictive
recommended
ever wondered if you could go back in time and change the past ever thought about how did earlier major civilizations rose and fell as soon as they were in power or do you just simply enjoy watching paint dry then this is the game for you choose your favourite civilization over a vast collection and find out why they started sucking so hard before entering medieval age witness how an ally decides to stab your back after being best friends for a over centuries just because you didnt answer their demands this game offers a great opportunity to feel like being in charge of everything inside a civilization and if the computer ai started making you mad try out the multiplayer and invite your dearest friends soon youll end up having vicious fights about someone making their decisions for hours you will love getting revenge on those wasted minutes this game is a 55 and a great pick for some mild lan parties
recommended
its not as bad as hitler
recommended
i love this game its easy to approach but hard to master its thematic the replayability is great as you branching paths and policy trees can be varied from the very start striving to get the best most successful historical civilization is truly addictive
recommended
this game is incredible its fun and addictive theres soo many different civilizations avalible to pick from the civilization i prefer to go with is napoleon or america
recommended
good game looking forward next one
recommended
really great game it requires thinking and strategy and its massive online is fun and with your friends its even better even when your friend backstabs yougrumble grumble i cant wait for civ 6or civ xi the only problem is the fighting their is no real strategy to it or deph but it works and can be fun if your winning p
recommended
dont play this with the lights off its scarier than amnesia
recommended
every time i recommend somebody this game i just tell them the story of the guy that played a single civ ii match for over 10 years in the far future the game has been able to reproduce all of the details of a distopic scifi future world all but 3 cultures have survived and these 3 has become supernations in a constant war against each other lasted more than a 1000 years most of the lands were devastated by the postnuclear war fallout and the people of these superpowers were starving because their leaders were spending all the resources available in war efforts even when the player was willing to withdraw from the war it was simply not possible because of the greed and the need for resources of the other two nations so when i fire up my civ game i always deactivate each type of victory i wanna go see the future
recommended
nothing like it best strategy game on the market right now 10010 would get nuked by a  off ghandi again
recommended
this game is absolouteley recommended and super fun there are still a few bugs but i will talk about that later if you turn the graphics on high it all looks so good its amazing the animations  fighting running moving are some of the best ever the only bugs i have found are the workers sometimes will build things and they never show up and i have to restart the game
recommended
define fun and boring at the same time
recommended
great strategy game for wasting hours on end 1010
recommended
its a good game but if u get it make sure to get the dlc otherwise its not worth it
recommended
god this game will take up so much of your time if you only got about an hour of time available i wouldnt even suggest opening it as you will be late for whatever you had to do after excellent jeu dans son ensemble je le recommande a tous et chacun pour les fans du genre et les nophytes a vaut le dtour
recommended

i have been a loyal fan to sid meiers since i started playing civ ii as a little kid i have easily logged thousands of hours on civ ii iii iv and v with my brother also matching those same kind of hours in game if you love turn based strategy this is seriously the best money can buy civ is the one game that calls me back every time it has the best replay value of any game ive ever played it is a different monster every time i play a new game the only thing i would warn players about is saving to the steam cloud early after i got this game i saved directly to the steam cloud to pick that game up on a new laptop somewhere along the way civ freaked out and now it will only allow me to play offline i dont get to earn achievements and steam doesnt log how many hours ive put into the game since then dont let the 86 hours i have racked up fool you i usually play at least 10 hours a week im probably somewhere around 400 hours at this point and many many more to come dont trust the steam cloud other than that enjoy this beautiful masterpiece

civilization v is the sequel to the immensely popular and reigning champion of the civilization franchise civilization iv with the beyond the sword expansion that game was almost perfect so the fifth game had some serious shoes to fill the biggest and most controversial change in civilization v is the change to a hex based system rather than squares they also removed the ability to stack units so one unit per hex is the limit this completely changed combat mostly for the better the game was plagued by serious almost breaking issues at the start the ai had problems figuring out how to work the hex combat system and was mostly completely dumbfounded in battle the removal of the religion system and the addition of some features claiming to make the game more accessible to newcomers lead to the accusations of a dumbed down game that didnt hold a candle to the mighty civ iv most of the issues were addressed in the gods and kings expansion which also added religion back into the game and expanded upon it well beyond what civ iv did the latest expansion brave new world finally made the game all it could be and now it is accepted that the game is on par with or even beyond civ iv if you wish to pick this game up then you should absolutely pick up brave new world as well as the game is no good without it brave new world also includes all the changes from gods and kings so you dont need both expansions the only thing you get from gods and kings is a couple of extra civilizations to play and that can safely be skipped even with all the improvements it has been said that the civilization series plays more like a board game than a grand strategy game we agree for people who want something a bit heavier on the strategy side we recommend europa universalis iv

recommended
best 4x of all time of all time
recommended
very complex and time consuming game that is quite in depth in many ways took alot for a first timer like myself to learn the ropes but once i did this game become a lot more fun i would only recommend this game to rpgstrategy ethusiasts as i still find it to be quite a hard game even on the easier difficulty settings this game is also what is called a turn based game which at first i found a bit boring once i adapted to the games style though the whole turn based system becomes very relevant and added another level of strategy to it all overall the game is well thought out and very in depth making it simply put epic
recommended
a very good turnbased strategy game you will start by choosing you civilization each one of them comes with different civ bonus unique unit and unique buildingimprovement or second unique unit by choosing different research options expanding your borders making you city grow recruiting an army and balancing between different aspects to keep you civilization secure and happy you will lead your civilizations through many eras to victory the ai in the game could be better while it may help you in the beginning and even will seem to be your ally they can start hating you because you have too big or too small army they will yell at your warmongering even if you are fighting again a common foe they will settle their cities near you and expect you to move since it`s their territory while you should start playing with ai to learn about the game it`s strongly recommended to play with other people since game can become boring an predictable after some time you should also buy complete edition of the game since g&k and bnw dlcs change gameplay a lot in a better way  you will be able to participate in world congress create trade routes found religions and much more
recommended
great game lot of things to do 1010

recommended
very addictive game dont be surprised to find yourself playing until 7am in the morning because you just need that one more turn the 2 dlcs gods and kings and brave new world are also very worth if you can afford it
recommended
civilization v is a great game it vaguley reminds me of a tycoon but yet so much more the standalone game is great but if you get the dlc you will be supprised how much better it is overall i give civ a 45 great job devs
recommended
very good sequel still liked civ4 and civ3
recommended
ive always been a fan of the civilization series and in my mind this is the best in the series i think that the new game mechanics are for the best this is a great game and is extremely addicting i love this game and i hope you do too
recommended
tons of replay value  and just playing through all the scenarios included in the base game will take quite a bit of time still lacking the modscene that was there for civ 4 but its getting there

recommended
this review is for those who are completely new to civilizations the sun rises you emerge from your cave with a new mindset a goal to achieve something no one has ever experienced before expansion you build a new home to you and others when the time comes and yet this hunger still remains you explore the vast surroundings and find many new resources unkown to you you experiement and realise this clay can be used for pottery fast forward 300 years your once small town has now expanded into 3 cities all of which are feared and respected by the surrounding neighbors yet they require more shall you attack and conquer the weak or befriend and parter up with the strong these are the choices you make in civilizations choose wisely
recommended
hours and hours of replay value best strategy game on the market and cant be beat 1110 would buy on itunes

recommended
1010 get jazzy with germany
recommended
the coolest thing about this game that sets it apart from other games like it is that you can take a civilization in any circumstance while you are playing compare it to real world history and get a parallel which connects civilization 5 to the real world history geeks like myself might enjoy such a feature whether intended by the makers or not but that is certainly not the only aspect that makes this game golden i cant even tell you how many times i have been awake at 300 in the morning playing this game realizing that i have elapsed about 8 hours straight playing civ 5 this is that kind of game the music the interactive leaders and the strategies you must devise to advance your own regime immerse you fully into the game once you are immersed good luck continuing any obligations you have in your real world life besides the absolutely wonderfully fun gameplay there is a potentially infinite replay value the different circumstances you can be put in are endless not to mention different rulers with different special abilities as well as 5 different ways to win everytime i come back to civ 5 after a period of playing a shiny new game i always get the same feeling i got when i first bought it the feeling of playing an outright fantastic game the replay value magnifies the quality of civ 5 tremendously and makes it a musthave 1010
recommended
yes this game is absolutly brilliant it has beautifull graphics and the gameplay is smooth the loading screen takes an age but it is so worth it very fewno bugs that ive seen are in the game 1010 get the game
recommended
this game is the sht 1010 worth every penny and also ruined my life
recommended
an amazing wellthought out game that is extremely fun and replayable although it has its flaws the game is still great
recommended
this game is one of the best single player is fun due to the many diffrent ways to win as well as the diffrent leaders own abilitys which makes you change strategy also there are many map types and can make is more challeging with the manyh difficulties varity of mods you can add and multiplayer with your friends is always a laugh
recommended
ia have some problems but its civ its cool is amazing maybe the best strategy game ever made so buy the game make they profit so they can make the civ 6

recommended
a very nice strategy game very simple yet so complex its a very fun game and you can learn a thing or 2 about history from it which is a bonus i guess and even though its not civ 4 its actually pretty fun
recommended
this game provides a very different form of entertainment than most other simulator games sid meier has captured the perfect combination of war science culture and economy you can win by taking over the world reaching alpha centauri sending a space shuttle into space via the apollo program or by building the united nations the only word that i can possibly sum this game up with would be wow
recommended
i strongly recomend getting this game gandhi needs more haters
recommended
oh dear god where did all my time go where am i
recommended
warning highly addictive sid meirs civilization v is a turnbased strategy game designed to take you through the eras of mankind while you expand your civilisation there truly isnt another game on the market which delivers an experience quite like this the game features no story driven campaign mode the closest being scenario games through dlc instead you setup your game preferences and launch the game typically begins with one combat unit and one settler unit who will form your first city this is where your story begins the game will always offer a completely different experience from the last match played due to its random seed generator different civilisations personalities and resource placement personally i feel what can limit a good experience of this game is a lack of imagination one match i formed an alliance with my neighbour rome early in the game because of mongolias warmongering and mass expansion of its territories so together i the ottomans and rome formed a coalition military and advanced on mongolia to knock them down a peg or two soon after we declared war on mongolia and we sustained a few loses romes forces pulled back i could only assume this was due to their economy being in recession and couldnt afford to train new troops and risk rome being defenceless my economy however was booming due to my northern trade routes with the english so my forces pressed on determined to liberate the captured citystate of monaco from the blood thirsty mongolians my troops succeeded at a high cost losing many regiments and more men being crushed by the mongolian might on their journey home back to the capital it was at this moment rome stabbed me in the back and invaded my lands with a huge force destroying my trade routes with the english and bringing my income to its knees the rest of the game and my relationship with rome turned into a back and forth battle of gaining and loosing territory from each other while my relationship with mongolia grew stronger why did rome do this i hear you ask because they were simple being racists or at least thats how i interoperated it through a politicians indirect use of language unlike many strategy games turnbased and realtime civ v can be picked up pretty quickly if this is your first civ title youll be familiar with the formula in not long at all its a very easy game to learn but can be a hard game to win sometimes it can feel like the ai isnt even trying other times you can come under constant invasions if i had to pick the worse point about this game itd be the ai in diplomacy isnt perfect with a few of the dialogue options making no difference to what the outcome will be
recommended
such a brilliant game go get it now
recommended
pretty beasty
recommended
germany isnt hitler 0100
recommended
dota2 is better though why do we russians love these strategies anyway

recommended
takes a playthrough or two to pick up but definitely worth it very timeconsuming but fun if you get the hang of it highly recommend if you have plenty of time to kill
recommended
its an amazing game if youre looking for a good long turn based strategy play this game
recommended
i swear to god ive only played it for about 15 minutes but it claims ive racked up about 30 hours the game lies obviously but its lies are sweet like the finest honey i recommend this game although its terrible for your sleep pattern social life and your ability to hold down a job youll soon come to realise the higher truth which is that you dont care about any of those things all you care about is getting revenge on that treacherous dog who declared war on you and building more giant death robots
recommended
6910 would get killed by ghandi again
recommended
bloody amazing just buy it already
recommended
its an exhausting game to play but once you have the bnw expansion its also one of the best strategy games youll get your hands on edit i have now played the game long enough to know what all my quirks with the game is i still believe its a really good game for a future civ game id love to see a pitboss mode that allows you to use a shared steamcloud save and gave steam notifications when it is your turn rather than having a dedicated server running hosting the game 247 while it is played which could be months potentially a pitboss mode like this would be even more attractive if a future civ game was focused more around optimization and lightweightness than pretty polygons the perfect civ would be an epic game spanding several months where itd take you 20 seconds to sign in take a turn and leave the game again
recommended
great game cant wait for beyond earth
recommended
amazing im totally addicted the dlc is heaven its a recommended for new and old civ players p
recommended
an excellent update to the classic series the gameplay is streamlined but not simplified and the hexbased map makes exploration easier and less timeconsuming the ai is a bit lacking but civ has always worked best in multiplayer it also feels like this game lacks some of the character that civ iv had the soundtrack isnt as good and its missing those classic leonard nimoy tech intros all in all a great game but id stick to iv for single player
recommended
i havent showered in a month because of this game turned steam offline to avoid annoying conversations only slept 4 hours a night got a full caveman neckbeard got 32dcup man  only ate doritos and mountain dew for six months wore a fedora to protect my hair from too many oils called all female ais mlady to prevent wars watched anime with english subtitles between turns to understand the japanese civ better lost all friends fitness and family 1010 recommended

if i had to tell anyone who wanted to know why they should play civ 5 this is why a lot of people including me find the game really fun addictive and even interesting in some respects with all of the historical content metacritic even gave the game a 90100 avarage score rating for goodness sake and its consistently one of the most top played games on steam yes some people might consider the multiplay not as good as the single player but even then it still has its moments and as you are playing with people the challenge is possibaly quite high finally as angryjoe said in his review for civ 5 the game is more focused towards the non and casual gameing market and was made for people like me who hadnt played a single civ title before as it is supposed to be more simple for non and casual gamers to play however this doesnt mean that the game is easy as the game is still very challenging and with all the mods and dlc which come with civ 5 this game is sure to make you exited on your next playthrough if i had to rate this game out of 10 i would give it a 810 for the standalone game and a 91010 with the brave new world and gods and kings expantion packsdlc as of yet this has been the most played game ive played on steam having played it for around 224 hours according to steam and is one of if not my most favorite games of all time

2010 nuked everyone until they gave me all their oil this is the best game ever

best game in the world <3 worth every penny d

i highly recommend civ to anyone who likes to build their own history a little its a game that shines when you invest yourself in it and explore the possibilities as any avid civ player can tell you you will truly form a symbiotic or perhaps parasitic relationship with your fellow players and ai all the while it being virtual and fictional and feel like history is really progressing inside your little realm as every player schemes their way forward that one settler takeover 200 turns earlier might be the reason why you decided to decimate someones civ or at the very least embargo them do you expand rapidly or keep it calm and small do you initiate combat with your neighbours or leave them as a safezone for potential invaders at the other end puppets and city razing science and faith everything is a factor in your ultimate victory or very untimely demise in short if you dont mind sinking hours into a virtual world and rant in frustration as your neighbour finishes your favorite wonder first a good casus beli for war if ive ever heard one then you shouldnt really be searching for anything else because you found exactly what youd want just a buttonpress away and probably a lot of cash
recommended
excellent great improvement on the original and new modes of combat and victory conditions make the game more strategic and diverse than ever before
recommended
one of the greatest strategy games ive ever played ive played this game for over 100 hours and can still play it
recommended
make sure you plan to get dlcs still playable without them but definately get them
recommended
it is a game
recommended
a great turn based strategy game tons of different civlilizations to play good depth and replaybility can customize to have games long or short with different maps supports multiplayer with frriends but i would recommend getting the brave new world expansion pack adds trade routes religion and much more overall my favorite strategy game out of all the ones i played get it
recommended
im still learning the game its only been about 3 days playing but i gotta say i reall quite enjoy this i come from a longggggg giggity background of age of empires but this is not like it civ 5 is like a super long giggity version of the board game risk thats more interactive and detailed the evil dictators can rule the land the friendly weirdos can chop down some trees the world is here for the taking 4 12 out of 5 acorns update 6 days later i now own all of the dlc and its just amazing lots of really cool and neat extra features it is overpriced in my opinion but its completely worth it if that makes sense also after aton of hours ive come to the conclusion that the devs put the barbarians in the game just to troll us rating increase 5 out of 5 acorns
recommended
you cand spend weeks on this game and still have lots to do a great game overall in my opinion
recommended
addictive
recommended
this game is super fun it takes a while to play each match though so if you dont want to spend a lot of time playing i wouldnt suggest this game however if thats not a problem definitely worth the buy
recommended
if you wanna build a nation from bc but not worry too much about strategical army setup then this is the game for you coming from one who has played this a massive amount of times its a great game
recommended
loved civ 4 and finally got a new graphic card so far it is a definate improvement to the previous games in the series i cant wait to spend countless hours on this game
recommended
overall ive spent over $100 on this game due to the fact that i bought it close to the day of release and have all the expansions this game is by far top 5 pc games ive ever played in my life and i play a lot of games absolutely amazing worth every penny

gandhi is warmongering phsycopath 1110
recommended
very fun game where you can command one of many civilizations from around time go to war with montezuma as george washington with genghis khan at your side or generate tourism for your civ fly into space or be elected world leader infinite replay value the expansion packs and civilization dlcs korea polynesia babylon denmark add a lot to the game and made my playthroughs a lot more fun brave new world the second expansion really fleshed out cultural victories mods add a lot of content to the game including maps civilizations and scenarios anyways this is a great game and i personally cannot wait for civilization beyond earth next fall 9510
recommended
god has given us the glory of bretrayal and nuclear war with gandhi thus i give the title of funniest funnest game to civ 5 but realy its an amazing game and worth the money
recommended
there is many things wrong with the world its your job to fix it get this game
recommended
this is a game you may not play too often but when you start a game be prepared for the next 550 hours to be solely focussed on wiping gandi off the face of the planet with nuclear weaponary your visions of being a peaceful civilisation are shattered by your own self greed for world domination your small tribe of simple warriors have evolved into super death machines that march from london to tokyo perhaps because japan settled too close to you and the city is only 2 turns walk away destroy conquer and rebuild ahem a few downsides to this game is that you may never return to an old campign each session generally feels like its time to begin anew also no one watching over your shoulder will understand how funaddictive this game is you just need to play it to understand
recommended
play it u wafflessssssss
recommended
it is very fun game to play and on higher difficulties a challenge to win the game
recommended
its a great strategy game where you start off as a civilization of your choice and you battle for victory against many other civilizations the game has different modes and scenarios so no match is the exact same
recommended
quite possibly one of the best games ever d
recommended
another remake of civ still the best nonspace 4x sound soundtrack & visuals are all great although i prefer the lenard nimoy voiceover mod advisors are back better than ever now with good tutorials if you need that now that units stacking has significantly changed how warscombat playout and with this change they kinda ruined the great generalsadmirals i like the new civopedia culture & social policies are a welcome addition you must use gk or bnw expansions preferably both for the game to really come alive through all ages not sure that religon is all that influential in terms of the game outcomes if you wont get civ5 with expansions or dlc all on sale and you arent modding steam workshop then dont bother and get civ4 get it when civ5 is on sale with the expansions dont bother with dlc until you have played through at least once unless the dlc comes as extras such as in the gold pack
recommended
the only game where i can shoot down jets with arrows and destroy tanks with spears 1010
recommended
started off rough but after patches and dlc is a solid entry if you like civ then buy it for sure
recommended
me like yes good 4 stars out of 2 thumbs thanks obama
recommended
a great game for anyone that wants to burn a few hours its a game of wits and brute strength forging allies and waging war all to gain a foothold over your rivals many or few every game is different with a huge selection of map types and playable factions i have played multiple runs of this game and still it is my favorite civ from sid so far im sure ill have many more hours in this game as the acheivment list is 200 multiplayer has a little to be desired as the matching can sometime take awhile and games tend to get overpowered one way or another rather early on finding solid players that can last a match is uncommon with all being said the game is definetly playing
recommended
great game if you like being a boss
recommended
my favorite games are simulation and open world and this game is both online matches get very competitive and can last for many hours the fact that you can build your civilization anywhere you want and as long as you want makes this a game i will always come back too
recommended
one more turn just one more then ill go to bed
recommended
so everyone pretty much has at least one game that they go back to over and over when other games have lost their novelty or have been completed or all the achievements earned for me thus far this is that game i could play a game on the ds or go back to the xbox but this is my favorite goto after the kiddo is in bed better yet it is easily explainable and fun to play with friends and family worth it to have in your library especially if its on sale
recommended
this game is amazing just buy it if you havent already even if you dont like turnbased strategy games you wont regret picking this up
recommended
i love this game theres never a boring instance when playing and i like that its progressive so you cant just get nukes 5 minutes and kill everyone you have to wait until you unlock it another things thats cool about it is the length while this might be a problem for some people i find that it makes you more attack to it because of how much time you put into it it becomes more a matter of actually protecting your capital at all costs rather than ill just lose and start a new game
recommended
i really like this game so much fun to play with friends
recommended
one more turn
recommended
this game is for all players wheather it is trollystrategic or laidback rise to power with you empire and dominate the scoreboard
recommended
i really love playing this game of the amount of strategy involved do build up your army or your towns what do you research to put your civilization ahead of the others do you march into war or be a diplomat do you make allies or isolate yourself whatever you choose will determine if you win or loose the game if you dont have a lot of time i would suggest playing against bots as you can pause the game multiplier games take a lot of time but are fun if you can afford the time so go ahead and spend your money on this game
recommended
civ 5 standalone was a 45 and i honestly preferred civ 4 to it civ 5 with the gods and kings expansion was a 55 and took the game past the threshold civ 5 with the brave new world expansion 9995 why dont you own this yet
recommended
gandhi world domination simulator get the complete pack when its on sale and enjoy endless hours of single player and online with friends
recommended

recommended
its sooo fun try it out and you wont be disappointed
recommended
great game very addictive ive played countless hours on this game even when you think that you have mastered the game there are new ways to play and win the animation is amazing and the ai is smart there are plenty of civilizations and policies to choose from if you havent played this game theh youve never experienced true fun
recommended
ive never finnished a single game 1010
recommended
i love this game it is great if you are a nerd like me and love screwing with history it also requires strategy and thinking again its not for everybody but it is 100% for me
recommended
contemporary roman empire new religion started caesarianism nuked washington take that murica russians didnt agree international outcry still wins all votes in world congress because city states dont care 1010 would nuke washington again

my buddy and i were playing together in a game with two of us and twelve computers the game took four weeks to complete as we slowly politically and militarily took over the world together we defeated the celts in the beginning to find out that our countries were on the same continent slowly i amassed a massive navy of submarines surrounding the entire world my friend liked aircraft carriers more so he traded and muscled his way into owning about 15 of them all equipped fully with fighters and bombers at the end of our weeks of play time we stood at the pinnacle of civilization then i got bored and randomly attacked my friend he scoffed at me bringing his massive number of aircraft carriers and planes to attack my capital then my submarines struck in two turns i had destroyed all of his ships every single one of his ships every single aircraft carrier died at the end of it my friend gave me a look of pure terror my submarines had won then he nuked my capital and won the game 1010 would get nuked again
recommended
is it good yes  this 9 hours is form 1 day of playing im ashamed 1010 like crack
recommended
its the best strategy game on the market
recommended
really fun game and has a very user freindly control and task bar i was excpecting a really confusing stategy game but i ended up getting a highlyaddictive awsome game if you love to conquer build and explore
recommended
definitely a must buy as it really worth the price you pay for a game that uses strategy and planing in order to conquer or achieve a certain objective isnt it everyone dream to take over the world or being the leader of an advance nation well at least for me  if single player is just not your thing get a bunch of friends and start teaming up or backstabbing them in the back to gain control in multiplayer  do remember is just a game though dont get serious when one bite your back haha great game for those who enjoy turn base and strategy game   it so interesting till you dont realize you have played it for hours haha
recommended
brave new world expansion just made this game even better ever wanted to play and take part in a subtle satire towards western worlds policy of subtle collonisation finally i can be a coward and hide behind trade sanctions and luxuary bannings starving millions and salting the earth of my enemies take that darius
recommended
if your looking for a game that lets you literally rule an entire empire againest other empires through the test of time then you should give this game a go its very addictive and will make you keep going turn through turn only to look at the clock to realise what felt like and hour turned into seven instead
recommended
be very careful playing this game you make think you know what time it is time to nuke gandhi but you realize that 3 days have passed since you have started your game and you havent drank or ate in the last 18 hours this game keep you saying just one more turn but dont let it make your decisions for you like when you should use the bathroom or when you should get another sandwich if you see this game on sale buy it immediately oh and brave new world did amazing things for this game buy it as well
recommended
with gods and kings and brave new world this game is the finished product cant recomendi it enough for turn based stragety fans a giant that will be hard to beat for 6
recommended
great game has its flaws but makes up for it with its great replayability its even more fun if you play it with friends
recommended
civ v is a a great game provided you have the gods and kings and brave new world expansions vanilla civ v is clunky and incomplete but with the addition of the two expansions this game turns from a dud into the best game in the franchise i highly recommend buying this with the two expansions if you can afford it
recommended
one of the best long running franchises in gaming history a must have title for gamers of all types
recommended
this one perhaps the greatest strategy game of all time strategy is indeed a huge part of the game but psychology also is especially when playing with friends it has enormous depth gold edition including science economy happiness combat and so on the game is fun singleplayer but online with others preferablly 3 or more it becomes one of the best of all time nothing is more satisfying than leading your people to a glorious victory by conquering others in the process or researching the most of the world
recommended
great game will kill time immensily great replay value a def must buy
recommended
washington should have conquered the world irl
recommended
it is possible that you disliked vainilla civ5 but trust me on this after 2 expansions the game has become a truly masterpiece
recommended
holy crap this is awesome
recommended
this game is great and is fun to play with friends
recommended
expertly balances the grand majesty of human accomplishment with the cartoonish evil of nuking mahatma ghandi into the stone age
recommended
great game
recommended
i like the game very much is realistic and enjoyable 9510
recommended
coming from a guy that never really was into strategy games this has to be one of the best buys i have ever done during a summer sale a must have game
recommended
an excellent game great graphics and gameplay
recommended
do you like having no clue what you are doing while thinking you might actually be doing something you would love this game so kawaii
recommended
a hardcore starcraft 2 play lose himself in a turn base strategy game
recommended
one of the best strategy games i have ever played the turnbased gameplay might not be suited for everyone but you get used to it very quick and the gameplay is just awesome there are unlimited ways how to envolve your culture and rule in peace or conquer wit the iron fist
recommended
this game is awesome not as awesome as civilization 2 but still  will beat any tbs game any time of the day
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played if you get the chance to buy this game do it youll pay for every move you make weather it be good or bad also playing as different civilizations gets you special rewards and perks depending on how you like to play pick it up now
recommended
i pour hours and hours into this game at a time i get so distracted and sucked into i have no idea why
recommended
yaw dis shizz be a pretty good strat 1110 would play again
recommended
this is fun
recommended
i love this game by far the best game you can get for wartime fun the strategy that goes into building your empire up and making everyone happy and fat with food after you build it up i normaly shot for a fight to death to see who wins and its epic the way you feel after beating the  out of your bff in multi player
recommended
95 out of 100 i definatly like the turn based play because it gives a refreshing change from the real time stratagy games i usually play it can be a little repetetive playing against the computer though so try playing it with others for variety
recommended
this game is very entertaining and i recomend it to anyone i dont like turn based games but this game is so well done and so entertaining that i never even notice that i have to wait for turns the npcs move so fast its almost like you never stop being in control there are so many unique strategies to follow and the outcome of any two games are never alike this is a spectacular game and if i were you i would seriously consider getting it
recommended
one of my favorite games ever civ v features such great variety that you can play for 600 hours like i have and it still feels fresh the game is well rounded and each of the victory options is obtainable in an enjoyable fashion each civ for the most part feels different and most are tailored to a specific victory type the ai is strong and on higher difficulties very capable of beating you however its through boosts not skill
recommended
a somewhat flawed diamond in many respects currently lacking some of the multiplayer features one would expect from the latest in the series the expansions help soften the blow adding much depth to the game plus in regard to multiplayer the service provided by giant multiplayer robot allows the asynchronous play sorely lacking at this time
recommended
this game is amazing great strategy and fun gameplay will leave you thinking okay just one more turn and thats my biggest complaint if you play this game you will probably get sucked in and spend hours upon hours playing it if youre going to buy it make sure you have the next day or two off work
recommended
sick game has me hooked for hours every time alot of depth to how it work
recommended
i love it my friend love it and now i persuaded my girlfriend she loves it too now we had a lot of fun with it good graphics and the talking portraits of the different civilizations they are cozy and looks like a true copy of the real thing p but im from denmark so mister bluetooth voice is really weird and unvikinglike
recommended
ive barely played this game so what do i know butit pretty much fits the bill for whatever style and whatever level you like to play if youre meticulous about creating the perfect citys in the perfect spots then this works extremely well if you like to madrush and conquer this is your game if you want to manipulate the world around you without ever firing a shot that can be done too builder pacifist warmongerer merchant diplomat or any combination thereof they are all available here as i read in a previous review civ v when it first came out disappointed me the civ iv iterations were definitely more immersive and honestly flatout better but with the expansions into gods & kings and brave new world civ v has surpassed that great game and now is the jewel of the series they all have their worth but if you spend any time at all learning the depth of this game you will be rewarded with many hours of time youll never get back and you wont regret it but like i said ive hardly played this game at all so what do i know
recommended
this game is worth it buy it now
recommended
sweet jesus this game is addictive
recommended
all in all it was a fantastic game i loved every minute
recommended
warning side effects of playing this game include 1 not being able to stop 2 racism
recommended
sid meiers civilzation v is one of the best stratagy games i have ever seen and i am not the only one who thinks that mulitple players and ign said the same thing civ v is a turned based game where you try to conquer your entire map but if that seems too hard you can either be the first to space have 5 diplomacies research everything or have the most points when 2050 comes around you play one of many famous conquers in history and try to build a civilization that will stand the test of time if you dont want to do this alone you dont have to you can make helpful citystate random civilization become your ally and they will reward you by sending you gifts of gold resources or even army units if that is not what you thought i meant by not alone dont worry you can play with other people and take down or befriend their civilzation fiddlesticks 910 review
recommended
do i recommend this game hell yes this is one of the greatest games i have played and playing it with friends is even more fun you can choose from many civilizations from the aztecs to russia and almost anyone else you can think of so in total yes i would reccoment this game to anyone and everyone
recommended
civilization has ruined and continues to ruin my life would recommend
recommended
awsome game can be simple or complex as you like at the easy diffculty but at the top levels you need to be on the ball every move the game allows you to be in control as much as you like from choosing citizen output all the way to let me make the key choices it simply is one of the best strategy games in my opinon
recommended
this game is awesome and for the next 30 hours you can get it for 75% off get this if you do not already own it
recommended
civilization v is a great game but with out the dlcs is a unfinished game that may disappointfans coming from civ iv but of course with the dlc it turned this unfinished game into a spectacular experiance that any civilization fan should have it has a dumbed down ui from civ iv but thats what all the games are doing so you gotta deal with it the main point is you have to get the dlc to see the full potential of this game or else you may be left unsatisified with the gameplay pros good gameplay on single and multi easy to ui for new players great dlcs that are worth the $3000 constant replayebility great community content on workshop and easy to use map editor cons dumb and random ai behaviour multiplayer session lag and disconnect oftan making it sometimes unplayable to easy to play in even the hardest modes  not enough stratigic resources 8510 get this game civilization fans
recommended
very good game good value for the price i have been playing several full games with different starting civilizations trying new tactics each time each type of victory is a goal to achieve in itself and some can be harder to achieve than others the ais are not super smart but can still be provide a challenge sometime
recommended
great game

recommended
addictive like previous civ titles ive easily spent more time on this than i would ever want to admit does take a little bit of getting used to though as you can no longer stack units still a ton of fun though and id highly recommend it

recommended
to like a startegy game is one thing but this this takes it to another level of strategy especially when you say to yourself one game or ill just finish my research then your head to head with your biggest rival with greece or something like that and realise i think ive been playing for 6 hours
recommended
literally hundreds of hours of potential gameplay and content in here and it only gets better
recommended
this game has changed my life  i no longer watch television that time is now dedicated to playing civ 5 endless hours of fun and i had put a decent amount of time into the game before i ventured into learning micromanagement of cities that opened up a whole new facet to the game that showed how versatile and fun it can be the only downside to the game is the ai crunch time in between turns and the lag with multiplayer
recommended
alright this game has received more hatred than any other version of civ ever and given the civ iii purist campaign for the last installment thats saying something as usual though most of the reviews given are comparing the game to civ iv with all of its expansions and rhys modding so just to add my two cents the game is a whole different animal from iv with new unit rules no stacking embarking immediately available for all land units and hexes whaat thats right the game uses hexes rather than the traditional squares for the grid these all take a while to get used to for players of the earlier versions but are all in all very fun the workshop content here is incredible i highly recommend jumping into that immediately for experienced players and trying out the new customization tools with bnw and gods and kings added the game really shines pros new look same civ feel at heart love the civs available venice particularly cities given defense of their own even without troops stationed in them music is soso but doesnt detract from the game in any way multiplayer as usual workshop content is awesome cons most glaringly the ai is incredibly easy i reached modern era as venice against five prince ais a full 20 turns before any of them this is my one real con for the game but i bought for the multiplayer anyway so not that bad wish that the maps generated more evenly with regard to resources i took over half of a large map early in the game only to find that alll the coal was on the other side \ honestly this is an incredible game with a bad ai if an enemy with an army twice the size of yours allows you to take a city from him with nearly no fight somethings wrong if said enemy then begs on his hands and knees for peace immediately afterwards somethings very wrong if his peace treaty offers literally everything he owns save his capital city i have no words for it i give this game a 8 out of 10 however despite this issue i play for the multiplayer so the ai doesnt effect me that much it is still an issue though so the diehard fans may want to reconsider this purchase if youre expecting a highrisk single player duel if you want a fun experience for multiplayer though or are learning the game i cant recommend it enough as more has come out for v online it has grown greatly as did iv and iii and ii best of luck all
recommended
quickly build your empire up make allies declear war reign supreme
recommended
dont play with danny unless youre willing to go nuclear
recommended
love this game though the multiplayer can be a lil buggy at times
recommended
i recomend this game if you own atleast one of the expansion if not its a pretty good one but you get more conetent with the expansions if you like world map strategy games its the series for you this game has deep gameplay and mechanics and oh so good multiplayer if you are a strategy fan or civ fan your probably going to like it
recommended
this is very good game that gets boing after like 300400 hours of play time biggest drawbacks are  ai of units  ai can build win with you by science but if you have like half a brain you will never lose by militarty conquest it is most apparent in ai moves accross ocean  even having submarine dont help them because they dont use them ai had my battleship on plate with two submarines in range and it just moved it without shotting at my ship it was like most wtf moment in game and i understood that unit moving was done by some half wit and not a programmer other that that game is well balanced i think it can be very entartaining form multiplayer purposes
recommended
amazing everything graphics gameplay you name it and it has it win a peace science culture or even a war victory this is the game for you if you love these command and strategy games but the game does require an exceeding amount of patience as one game can last hours and still end up in loss but it is absolutely one of the funnest things you can do on your devise and i would highley recommend getting it
recommended
a wonderful game since the first release civ 4 was great civ 5 is great too but it comes with better graphic and the hex grid with a different combat system i really enjoy this kind of game  lets do another turn  oh another turn  wait one more turn to me its a real keeper once started u cant stop lol it offers so many depth in politics economy trading research etc which is welcome by old players but it might be hard for new comers
recommended
its allright yeah
recommended
asked alexandra for some wool the whole world declared war on me lesson learned dont ask for wool
recommended
hope you can make a quick decission
recommended
very enjoyable gameplay intense when other top civilizations declare war on you but if you can pick up on things quickly they can be easy to beat
recommended
look im reccomending a game
recommended
great game
recommended
good game to play with a some freinds better with the dlc
recommended
ive spent so much time in this game that its not even funny at least when noting the fact that ive yet to actually finish a game seriously i love this game though it can get a little tiring in the later stages of the games
recommended
this game is great to play with friends and is extremely enjoyable its a blast to play with others as you make alliances trade with other civs and race to make the best civilization single player mode is also quite fun though some of the ais are strange and the diplomacy is awkward still though the higher difficulties can pose quite a challenge i would definitely reccomend it to someone else as a game they could get sucked into for hours on end
recommended

when i purchased sid meiers civilization v i had no idea what i was getting into note people have said you need the complete edition dlcs and such to make the game better and theyre soooo right being someone who has played with and without the dlcs i strongly reccomend buying the complete edtion over the standard edition i played 7 hours in my first real sitting of civ v and started out as playing alexander ruler of greece which was fun and all but i didnt really enjoy playng as him after that i convinced some friends of mine to get the game since it was on sale and now ill mostly play multiplayer with my friends they all now love civilization v also and they always thank me for having them buy it graphics  8510 gameplay  910 replayability 910 personal rating  1010 game ps never trust ghandi

for a buggy mess of a game it is one hell of a fun ride

you cannot end what you have started the game will glue your  with the chair for 316 hours personal experience > 10910 would neckhurt again everytime > every single freaking ai leaders wont accept a fair trade all they mind about is profit > never trust catherine montezuma bismarck and everybody else especially when a large group of unit is within the edges of your borders and sends a request for an open borders gaah refuse it like you do it for life and better prepare as it happens to be honest sid meiers civilizaton v became one of my favorites since my first three hours to the game it perfected 2 aspects the chessliketurnbasedcasualtycoonstrategygame and the historical aspect both are perfect i love history and that gave me enthusiasm to even play the game even further final verdict  history  the strategic gameplay  well made and detailed historical figures gandhi oda washington  many possibilities and wide range of yeah possibilities  the narrator  the music that fits the civilizations respectively asian for asian party rock skrillex  annoying bots that wont accept a declaration of friendship and a fair trade 1010 neckhurting simulator possibly because i play it for 3 hours oh god
recommended
the best strategy turn based ive played
recommended
bit unstable on multiplayer but otherwise a great game

my review of civ v this game is amazing basically what you do is grow your empire make friends with other empires and when the time comes you could fight with all the opposing empires once you have built your army it was surprising how each country had different looking military this game is unique and fun definitely recommend worth your $30 go check it out its awesome and epic and is the best strategy game ive ever come across in my life not even exaggerating this game is so beautiful and just epic go for it
recommended
i dig it an excellent if not overly effective way to pass an entire day without realizing it
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
its a civilization game  with the expansions its one of the best the 4x genre has to offer mustplay
recommended
certainly one of the best games ever made it keeps me coming back time and time again
recommended
i really enjoy this game it is a worthy addition to the civilization series
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played
recommended
its a very fun strategy game i havent had fun playing a strategy game since warcraft 3 the frozen throne
recommended
this game is great a lot of people claim to like civ 4 better but i kind of like 5 it is a little simpler to manage your empire citystates are a great addition and the new combat system requires a bit more skill no more unit stacking if you have played the older versions youll love 5 and if you havent i would probably recommend started with 5 over 4 
recommended
this game is one that you will not want to play but once you do you cant stop for eight hours
recommended
largest tiome sync in the world and i mean that in the best possible way
recommended
i am the king of siam and i pay everyone to be my friend a game if you have brave new world
recommended
civ 5 is a game that is as deep or shallow as you want to make it at it most basic you build your city up and attempt to be the worlds number 1 super power through military culturereligion or science this is really easy to get into and eventually youll be managing cities individually and assigning special people how you see fit knowing which techs are absoulte needs writing civil service useful monuments great library the game has two expansions brave new world  gods and kings they enchance the game greatly polishing off to make it the best 4x stragtey game on the market this isnt to say civ5 isnt without its faults harder difficulties arent really more difficult the ai just starts out more technologicly advanced and thats not really a greater challenge as you pretty much have to rush certain techs and wonders to have a chance i persoanlly dislike city states they never really develop into anyhting intresting other than side quests to sell resouces too and save from barbies sure you can win the game by befriending them but most likely you just want to conquer them my problem with the victory conditions are its possible to win while trying to get all 3 its not uncommon to be working on a culture  science victory while going for military and the science happens first but these are mostly minor details as completeing full games takes a long time depending on your time setting and youll always be saying one more turn
recommended
this game has eaten up my life ive lost everyting my wife left me but in the end i still have civ the love of my life
recommended

this game is amazing it offers a unique blend of strategic gameplay and cleverly paced action i encourage anyone out there interested in strategy to try this game also even if you have never been into strategy this games crowning achievement in my opinion is its accessibility i never played a civ game before this one but id like to think im decent at this game but i do have one criticism about this game if you are going to get this game get it with either bnw or g&k both would be great but at least get one because i think they left a lot of stuff out which is added in the dlcs which are necessary to a good experience religion good trade etc so there it is i hope you enjoyed my short and i hope informative review of civilization v thank you for reading
recommended
i come with warnings this game is addicting if you have a job a family or anything that requires any type of attention i recommend you dont play this game its amazinga and i think ive wasted entire summers just sitting here with the just one more turn virus i bought this game years ago and still cant stop playing itand i dont want to stop

remember the good ol days of playing age of empires for hours on end and still barely scratching the surface well now imagine that you do the same thing but you havent even seen the surface yet civ v is one of the best and indepth strategy games ive played its a classic example of oh ill just play for an hour or so and the next thing you know the sun is rising and youve been up all night declaring war and toppling empires highly addictive enormous fun and multiplayer is brilliant even locally this game is worth whatever the price tag says
recommended
good game excuse me but its my turn again
recommended
this game will destroy your social life
recommended
incredibly addicting
recommended
it an interstating game to play i enjoy it
recommended
civilization v is where you come to pour tons and tons of important hours of you life into an amzing game its worth it i promise this is basically a electronic boardgame about the revolution of civilizations you can play as any world leaders or your own character and develop through time goes each turn equals to a year and this game is very interesting you can either be a warmonger and claim all the land or be friends with everyone and be very kind and work deep into politics declare war and trade all day and build until you fly into space itself civ v is a good game so just buy it already 910
recommended
no other game feels as epic the feeling of building a great empire that can stand the test of time is really where civilization 5 shines
recommended
you get addicted but its a good addiction and you should accept it
recommended
spectacularly fun ridiculously addicting  you should just get the brave new world expansion to start out with the original and 1st expansion gods and kings still left the game a bit crippled with frustratingly random ai behavior but the gameplay feels very solid and complete now huge time sink d
recommended
worth it goty of the year of the game is good buy is good i play you play you play you buy you buy
recommended
it is amazing there is two dlc for it and that adds so much but even with out the dlc it is still amazing you can play together to who will win you can amercia rule money and many armys also so many other countrys
recommended
this is an incredible game with a nice userfriendly interface and complex strategies a lot of fun in multiplayerdefiently worth every penny d
recommended
i love this one over all the rest you cannot just stack your troops into an unstoppable one tile wide army you have to use strategy that being the main difference in the game the rest is all civilization boot it up and kiss the next 24 hours goodbye as you time travel
recommended
great game
recommended
this game is ridiculously addicting would definitely recommend as it is a great strategy game
recommended
i love this game you should get all the dlc
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
i made a civilization in this game a civilization of fun not the band
recommended
good game if you have time for one game
recommended
three words best game ever great game to kill time
recommended
great game but will take a some time to finish it
recommended
highly recommended for 4x game lovers
recommended
one of the best incarnations of the civ series i know a lot of the hardcore players mourn the loss of the unit stack but i prefer the one unit per tile style even if the implementation has a few issues with so many difficulty options i recommend this to just about anyone start on the easy difficulty and work your way up im still missing a win on the absolute top difficulty but ill get it eventually
recommended
if there was a potato civ i would be it
recommended
this is a very entertaining game i find it very challenging though that may say more about me as a player than it does about the game its a very good game from a genre i dont typically enjoy
recommended
get itend of story
recommended
i will say this once get this game realy fun with or without friends great strategy game all around 910 stars has some multiplayer bugs with the more peoplebots in the game
recommended
pretty fun game if you like building a civilization from the ground up
recommended
i play this series since civilization 2 its worth it  trust me
recommended
very good game i advise everyone
recommended
time consuming but totally worth it
recommended
great turn based strategy game very indepth with lots of worthwhile dlc available that adds significatly to gameplay
recommended
hands down the best strategy game you will play given the complexity of the game the learning curve is steep but not that steep ive invested 200 hours into the game and am still learning new things many improves in v make this game not only more approachable but tactically different than its predecessors various victory conditions and civilizations to play make this game such an amazing feat by firaxis games a must buy
recommended
never played a civ game before i played this one and it is a lot of fun even without the dlc i played about 40 hours and with the expansions it is even more addicting i bought it when it was on sale but its definitely worth full price
recommended
civilization series were always the most addicting difficult and rewarding games ever civilization 5 alone or with gods and kings & brave new world is the most time consuming devil that posses your time and will never give it back although your only way to resist is to click next turn and bring glory to your civilization most complex game with many victory types strategies difficulty levels from easiest for even strategy noobies to most experienced generales who were raised with rts by their sides units resources everything this game has everything that us  nerds love and you can read a book in one time while playing on huge map around atomic era d
recommended
that ghandi guy is really helpful
recommended
amazing game that forces you to balance between being nice with others and destroying your enemies to expand your empire
recommended
awesome game with the dlc but the standard version is missing a lot of stuff from older civs buy in bundle if price is reduced but not only main game
recommended
its like risk but no one is liable to flip the table on you the dlc is must have and the workshop community downloads are great for improving or mixing things up
recommended
really enjoyable game extremely easy to sink hours and hours into it thanks to its good replay value
recommended
solid strategy game but make sure you have time on your hands if you want to jump into this game although it is quite time consuming the size of this game is just unbelievable a whole variety of civilizations maps victory types and military units cause you to mix different strategies to best conform with the current world which is pretty swell
recommended
great game for people who enjoy strategy games
recommended
this game is an incredible game that appeals to those who love politics strategy and ideals of world domination build a nation from the ground up and conquer the world with your military your nations culture or your amazing diplomatic powers one of my favorites ever this game has certainly made me into a civilization fan
recommended
amazing thats all i can label it as nothing is more fun than watching your enemies capital be ingulfed by a mushroom cloud from your nuclear arsenal with plenty of modding capabilities the possibilities for this game are endless this game overs a great variety even without mods too will you be a kind and benevolent leader or a merciless tyrant will you be a religious fanatic or a rational heretic will you pull the world into nuclear conflict or make world peace will you stomp upon those weaker than you or will you make allies and fight the neverending war machine will you build a nation that will stand the test of time
recommended
the best strategy game ever created it is extremely fun and interesting you will find yourself playing it for hours the possibilities are endless in civ 5 it is beginnerfriendly as there is a bunch of hints and information that the game provides you as you play setting up a game is easy there are also many options you can tweak to make your world what you want it to be the dlc for this game is awesome and it adds even more variety to this game steam workshop also adds mods to this game that you can download and have even more fun exploring civ 5 make your civilization grow from the ancient era to the future you will find yourself addicted and going to the next turn and then the next turn multiplayer with your friends is very fun and you can team up overall this game is worth it and i recommend civ 5 to everyone
recommended
this game is amazing
recommended
honestly if you are fan of stategy games civ 5 is for you bots can actually be a challenge sometimes but by far the most enjoyable way to play civ is with friends a huge selection of civilizations to choose from all with their own perks and specials game mechanics make sense to the idea of the game  to lead a civilization throughout history better yet like many steam games the workshop for this game is great makes it just that much more replayable
recommended

recommended
great game good graphics and gameplay
recommended

recommended
its awesome
recommended
great game just make sure you have all day to play a match
recommended
if youre going to buy this game buy the two expansion packs they drastically improve gameplay but overall this game is a great game and it will suck the life out of you
recommended
ive been playing civ since microproses first game boy since the second one civ v is the most inovative yet loyal to original game general dinamics purists will initially dislike the abundance or mere existence of citystates but once you start playing youll see they contribute enormously to the game balance and a more dynamic early game stage if wou like turn base strategy games civilization v is mandatory
recommended
hands down an amazing game with hundreds of replayable hours to be had each play through entails something different sometimes providing frustrations ie wonder stealing and barbarian raids but most of the time giving a very enjoyable gameplay experience online play is where this game peaks get together with friends and have sessions as you advance through the ages and have a very good time a definate jewel of a strategy game
recommended
awesome game spent many hrs destroying civilizations and completing the space race
recommended
this game is awesome just awesome ive currently played it for just under 100 hours in a few weeks and i am completely addicted 1010 easy
recommended
great game best empire building sim ive played in a long time and the dlc adds an amazing amount depth to the game making all those boring turns where you had to wait more interesting by giving you spies to control a religion to build famous works of art to create and collect and dozens of new buildings multiple changes to cultural unlocks and culture trees a complete rework of the culture system and several new units that fill gaps that never should have existed no more 300 years of archers followed by 500 years of crossbowman fights
recommended
this is an excellent video game with lots of replay value and its actually pretty quick to get the hang of things i found that the advisors helped me to find my way quicker you really have to think hard on the different choices you make so that actually adds to the fun i find for instance you can make an error in the beginning of the game that can affect the whole outcome i made a lot of mistakes my first playthrough accidentally nuking the wrong person attacking an ally challenging a very powerful and wellarmed washington and i think a lot of people will but it really just helps you learn how to handle things next time i recommend this to any gamer looking for a test of strategy or just looking to have some fun
recommended
in my opinion its the best of the civilization series  and pretty much one of the best strategy games of all or so i thought until xcom came around still very fun and everyone recommends it the expansions are totally worth it as well and the dlc is pretty much as youd expect  youll know if you want it or not
recommended
45 endgame without dlc becomes snoozeville buy
recommended
excellent game better with each installment
recommended
civ civv  civ5 with all the dlcs brings back everything you had in civ4 but with a bit more polish if you can score this with gods & kings together on sale grab it if you like the civ franchise
recommended
sid meiers civilization i think that just about sums it up doesnt it
recommended
1010 would civ again
recommended
looking to waste your life away better get this
recommended
incredibly indepth tactical experience unrivalled by any game ive played to date its epic in scale fantastic in gameplay and huge in scope and size purely magnificent
recommended
great game make sure you get all the expansions in order to get the best out of it 
recommended
this game is highly addicting and insanely fun 100010 advised to buy on sale as its pricey as fudge
recommended
good game still miss some features 4 had though
recommended
if i had to be fair to play this game you should have six or more hours to spare the time goes by fast but the game its a blast do not trust ghandi
recommended
boring kelley a$$ game that is only good for one playthrough dont regret the purchase though
recommended

recommended
this is an amazing game i would recommend buying it if you do buy it make sure you have friends to play it with as it is much more fun with friends
recommended
amazing game addictive and really fun dont start playing right before finals week
recommended
ghandi is a mass murderer in civ 5 a game in which you sit around for 30 turns to make a single building its a fun game but even on the fastest setting makes casual a thing of the past watch your armies crumble to shreds your villages pillaged and destroyed and learn to hate everyone around you today in civilization 5
recommended
nothing beats taking over the world
recommended
very fun game and you can optimize the options even for a crappy pc
recommended
i freakin recommend this awesome game buy it now
recommended
absolutely stunning game battle with historys greatest leaders 
recommended
this game when it came out back in 2010 i went out immediately to buy it from gamestop because i wanted a hard copy since its release they have added great dlc and we can expect more in the future one of my favorite turn based strategies just like i would recommend before making any purchasing of a game watch a video on youtube and get an idea if you would like to play what youre seeing in the video i would recommend this game to really anyone its just a great time wether youre just playing singleplayer or multiplayer
recommended
great strategy game especially if youve played any of the other civilization games
recommended

lost hours of my life
recommended
this game was worth every penny
recommended
addictingly brilliant ive lost entire days playing this and i have no intentions of stopping anytime soon each playthrough leader map and perhaps most wonderfully mod presents a new an unique experience
recommended
i really went out of my comfort zone when i asked for this game as a gift and i must say that i love this game fairly engaging good depth and countless ways to go about tending to your civilization  recommend buying for all types of gamers
recommended
one of the best games ever if you have a nice group of friends to play with me and my pals play all the time worth the buy also note you do not need gold to get brave new world
recommended
love it you all should play this great game
recommended
great game that you can play multiple times and each time is different
recommended
this game is good everyone should buy it
recommended
this game is really fun and you can spend hours playing a single round i reccoment getting all the dlcs when their on sale the dlcs are really good and add alot of content the only thing i dont like is that the ai isnt very agressive
recommended
wow this game is sooooooo addicting play it play it now i sold my car to buy the game and expansion packs
recommended
wonderful game hours of playability
recommended
im not a big stratagy guy but when i was told to purchase this game ive never looked back on the decision worth every penny 2010 ign
recommended
quite hard but is fun
recommended
nothing like earning the trust of a civilization in the game to then backstab it with trebuchets and cannons and conquer over half its cities or impose your religion over others or lose your friends forever 1010 reccomended
recommended
great game reminds me of age of empire
recommended
this game is amazing

recommended
awesome game i normally have trouble focusing for more than 5 minutes but ive logged 60 hours already a lot of game mechanics to learn but overall it equates to a very fun game
recommended
a turn based strategy game that has held me in its clutches since the 4th installment it passes my time much too quickly
recommended
i could have mastered any skill of my choosing but instead i play this game if you want to lose hours upon hours of your life play this vidja game

50 hours into your latest save all is going well only 3 leaders left gandhi caesar and washington you draft an end game plan in your mind you will make friends with gandhi for obvious reasons hes chill then procede to befriend caesar then you will take out washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior he must pay 20 turns later all is going to plan we are now on washingtons doorstep gandhi and caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation all we need to do is eliminate the pesky americans and ith all our military now on american soil this should not take long then after the swift invasion of america we will make a vote for world peace at the un in rome of course with our new found indian and roman brethren it is a sure win but all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start quickly they become louder and louder what is this you think to yourself a false alarm you shrug it off maybe caesae bombing a city state the game pauses gandhi appears on the screen with a sinister grin he shouts war in your face only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight the camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy the capital of your glorious nation you then hear a rumble just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine you realise it is too late you can only watch as the missle closes in as your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people then silence before what had just occurred had sunk in before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears suddenly countless stealth bombers appear seemingly out of no where soon the sky is blackened by planes the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains you faint from the shock of what is unfolding you awake shortly after gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire now with giant death robots making the most of his seemingly never ending turn as gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes whats left of your broken nation all you can do is weep your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn why oh why did you turn of autosave did it really speed your game up was it worth it ghandi is a complete  he acts like your friend but will nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself 1010

i only played a little but it was fun

i am the peaceful nation of the celts we shall be the nation of religion and of diplomacy this went well we ended up next to the babylonians and we expanded nicely in peace however i have always believed in dibs so i placed down glasgow onto the land between us to provide a little buffer they seemed annoyed by this a few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years but otherwise nothing too bad happened in order to spread our religion further because we were known for our confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster we begin to invest in boats soon we covered the oceans in missionaries inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies babylon was making friends with a local city state genoa however they were trying to spread zoroastrianism those heathens despite both our religions being known for their peace we passiveaggressively sent missionary and inquisitor to genoa over the course of about 700 years we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions those same warriors had been given spears now but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders i offer babylon some sugar for their spice they wanted my sugar iron coal and all of my money i then asked germany if they wanted sugar for spice they accepted north of me rome had begun a war with france due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade i found myself with a huge amount of money everytime france and rome made peace i knew that rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes so i bought i gifted many city states my religion and gold and then i bought gifted france and germany enough money to declare with with rome while they fought my spearmen now musketmen continued to glare with babylons and we continued our 1500 year religious passiveaggression over genoa they said i was spying on them i said i wouldnt when my spies returned i sent them back to babylon a squad of 5 great prophets charged into babylon converting left right and centre babylon complained i was being a bit aggressive i apologised i then sent more missionaries to babylon i had now found every single civilization we decided to have a united nations meeting in 1600ad i as the host gave everyone a single vote except myself i gave myself 16 due to my popularity i declared my religion to be the world religion every one opposed i listened to their opinions and then passed it anyway when rome got angry about this i then paid france to declare war again when babylon got angry i then paid rome to declare war on them my civilians were amazingly happy hugely more than any other place but because i was an emperor they declared me declis the terrible despite my universal healthcare happy citizens peaceful religion not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word my army consisted of mostly my friends my city states and my musketmen now great war infantry continued to glare at the babylonian great war infantry after 2000 years a great duty to my nation their descendants shall continue to frown at the babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall eventually we reached a grand united nations meeting i sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 city state friends and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side i said that the peoples confucian republican empire of scotland was the best nation in the world they all voted against me i smiled and then declared i won anyway democracy is overrated freedom of religion only applies to my religion i dont need to be stronger when im more popular and my people are probably more beautiful and if you dont like me ill pay your best friend to backstab you through this i came to understand american foreign policy so civilization is if nothing else an educational tool

when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold dyes and ivory take my advice ready all your tanks and nukes arm them and shoot them like your life depends on it they are evil traitorous demons never trust them however genghis khan is my best friend he came up to me and was all like de full do bu la chi mendo and i said okay lets be friends i can never understand that guy but something about our relationship just works ghandi hating simulator 2014 1110

this is a great game i havent played for a long time but so far i love it the graphics are great it runs perfectly on my laptop the worlds randomly generate making it a different challenge each game the ai is amazing the robot turns dont take long at all to generate and the game goes from easy to hard at just the right speed so you can learn how to play before the ais destroy youor before you destroy them probably hundreds of different buildings to build a lot of stuff to research from discovering how to farm to giant death robots and nukes plenty of different army choices and and and so far i cant seem to find any flaws in this game i might find one or two later on but so far its just awesome im gonna be playing this for a while
recommended
quite possibly one of if not my favorite games of all time having grown up with the series i feel civ v takes the very best of the previous games and makes it more consice and streamlined i highly recommend this game to those who have never played any of the previous games and enjoy strategy games as it is an excellent place to start 9710
recommended
civ 5 its expansion packs and dlcs are simply the best of the civ series each adding a slew of new features to the base game if you like strategy games buy it now

does time pass by like its a rocket ship on cocaine do you wonder where the past 2 weeks have gone do you ask yourself why cant you go to bed if you answered yes to these three simple questions than you are either on cocaine or playing civ 5 this game will literally make you advance into the future at a rate of 25 times normal time speed and will also cure uninsomnia this game is great for anyone who is on cocaine and needs to stop time speed not an actual term
recommended
sid meiers civilization is one of the most enjoyable games ever designed it runs smooth without glitches and has an amzing soundtrack to acompany the amaing gameplay
recommended
this game is immensely fun there is nothing like building an army attacking a weaker nation and then conquering them however in civ you have to be able to take losses because you will take a lot of them as well but thats half the fun civ also puts a lot of stress onto resource management and city placement because a good first city can give you a tremendous head start while a poor one can stack the odds against you before you even begin and trust me the ai can smell weakness
recommended
this game is endless fun you can create an empire and be friendly or destroy everyone you see
recommended
an ace game not bad for a fiver
recommended
i really enjoy playing this game there are lots of ways to win with great replay ability
recommended
this game is the best game i have ever played

full of entertainment best thing is that every game is different

bichass game 1010

very amazing gameonline could use some work and i feel like you have to buy the dlc to get into a online game sometimes but its really fun when your in oneone of the best strategy games i have ever playedits not like total war thoughtheir is a strategy to military units and how you use them and place them but its not complex or anythingits mostly about growing your civilization and becoming number 1 through militarydiplomicyscienceor culturaleach civilization has its own perks and had advantagesfor examplejapan military units fight at full strength even when damged or russia gains double the amount of strategic resources when harvested its also very cool to see time go by and how your civlization changes especially in the modern agewhen you get really far in the game you even get to nucular weapons which is when it gets really crazy and the space age etc if you get gods and kingswhich i highly recemend alsoit adds religion and the modern age is split it to more ages and last allot longer which is a good thingyou also have vast game options for what you want your game likeyou can decide if theirs barbshow many city stateswhat type of map you want to play on around 25 or so map typesexamplepangeacontinentssmall continentsislandseurope etcyou can set at the pace of the game to make it go faster like building and learning stuff fasteryou can set turn timers for online gamesset the age of planetamount of resources on mapand allot more crazy stuff like sea level and more anyone who is a fan of strategy gamesthis is a must buythough its not perfectmilitary i feel like could have more strategy but theirs enough to make it competive and to where you can beat a civilization with a much stronger military if you have good unit placement and where you maek them attack etcwithout gods and kings some civilizations are a little overpowerd like france and ai can be s sometimes which is why i play onlineoverall this game is great and one of the best strategy games i have ever playedbetter than total war in my opinion
recommended
challenging and crazy fun this game makes time disappear
recommended
this game is very addictive and is very fun to play and i higly suggest this game this game gets even better with the big and small dlcs like brave new world and gods and kings and other dlcs and expansions
recommended
let your imagination flow and empire grow
recommended
this game is the best strategy game i have played ever you should get it now
recommended
excellent upgrade to the previous release of civ
recommended
i got this game with my preorder of xcom enemy unknown and i have played it almost twice as many hours alright so the net code is largely wank hamachi can fix that with steam workshop support its very easy to mod and can greatly enhance your experience
recommended
amazing game to play with friends or single player
recommended
if you like long drawnout strategy games and building things then this is the perfect game for you the biggest difference of civ v with its predecessors is immersion when playing civ v its very easy to become emotionally attached to your civilization be ware however that civ v is long and drawn out even on quick mode a fullscale game can often last weeks and even months and its difficult to keep your body alive while partcipating in a game of civ v
recommended
run look away from this place if you delve deeper you wont escape the only thing worse than a wonderful game is a wonderful game that never ends now if youll excuse me ghandis totalitarian regime is demanding brazils sacred jewel mines

just to give this review some perspective ive been playing the various iterations of civ for a very very long time i remember playing the original like it was yesterday beavis and butthead on the tv nirvana on the radio and me on my packard bell i spent hours in my moms basement wasting away from rickets while the normal kids were soaking up the sunlight going out on dates playing sports and leading generally normal productive lives civ 1 really messed up my lifebut in a completely awesome way i mean i couldnt get enough doubly so with civ 2 the things you could do with that game it hadpersonality i remember little stuff like the different architectural styles that gave the game such an immersive quality i remember how every time i played the world had its own story and how things would seem to take on a life of their own the endless war with the mongols my alliance with the germans butting heads with caesar i learned more about history there than i ever did in school it was fantastic i didnt even play to win most of the time i was a fifteen yearold kid in a sandbox i got older and civ grew with me i spend endless hours on 3 and 4 balancing game commitments and my real life when civ 5 was announced i didnt hesitate i bought it immediately in short it didnt take me long before i realized that this new civ was nothing like the civ of old ive never played revolutions but ive heard there is a lot of overlap i dont know what i do know is that this game is boring really really boring never have i clicked the next turn button like i have here maybe its because it takes forever to build anythingso long in fact that its easier just to hoard gold and buy things maybe its because expansion andor conquest isnt really encouraged the seemingly massive happiness hit just makes it unreasonable so i sit there just watching the world slowly go by and how slow it isthe loading screen between turns has become my nemesis ive turned the superb graphics down to their lowest setting just to speed things up and to keep things from jumping from one side of the world to the other every time i scroll my mouse just to be clear i have a computer that can run all the latest shooters yet cannot run a turnbased strategy game aimed at a mass audience the ai is dumb and unfinished if my dog had fingers he could win on prince at least i dont consider myself the smartest strategist but i have never lost a war in civ 5 ever i started on warlord then prince then king onward and upward i went until i quickly realized that the ai wasnt getting smarter it was just cheating this was acceptable 15 years ago not now why is gandhi determined to kill me after 2000 years of good relations he wants to kill me not a biggie mind you because all he does is park archers next to my swordsmen where i can promptly slaughter them after i defeat his army without taking any cities he offers me all of his resources all of his gold and all of his cities except for his capital of course he just gives up i take him up on his offer because i am obviously smarter than him but that means my happiness tanks my production stops and my steady income stream is now in the red whatever i still have 3 swordsmen and 2 archers i can conquer the world with that screw culture did i mention the music man its boring no more period specific soundtrack tribal or classical just the turnbased equivalent of elevator music im sure the graphics are the beesknees but with me playing on the lowest graphics setting i will never know citystates which were made out to be a big deal are not they ask for stuff you give it to them or not they give you stuff or not that is the extent of the citystate strategy boring actually the citystate thing reminds me of a problem i have that extends beyond the poor quality of this game professional reviews why did every professional game review outlet give civ 5 high marks 910 a really every review ive seen has been the same it has hexes it has citystates one unit per tile ranged combat beautiful graphics i even saw reviews gushing over how cool the opening sequence was you know the one you cant skip for one i am tired of seeing the old man in the hut every time i load up i find it oddly fishy that no professional reviewer has brought up the bugginess the fact that you need an internet connection the fact that you need steam the fact that the ai stinks etc etc etc just hexes and citystates either they were told to write a good review by the powers that be or they spent a total of 3 hours playing before writing their reviews either way i will never trust a professional review source ever again i gave this game 2 stars because i believe it still has the potential to be good after a few expansions some mods a rhys and fall a fall from heaven yeah it could be good ive played around 60 hours and still see a spark of genius here but it will take an awful lot of work right now its like watching paint dry
recommended
mods are brilliant
recommended
honestly a game to suck you in but you will never make it out as it is very addicting to either see be the warlord you are inside or the kind hearted diplomat with a passion for victory without violence or even in some cases the pious religous leader you were meant to be this game is easily my favorite
recommended
i cant help but recommend this game hours of playtime at a reasonable cost
recommended
i have been using this game to predict upcoming world events and it has been about 85% accurate in 60 cases 910
recommended
this is the best strategy game ever i have to admit i cant stop playing it nothing is more fun than being able to be your favorite civilization then conquering the world with them amazing game buy it
recommended
very in depth although there are some massivly overpowered civs like russia just as warning ghandi is not your friend past the atomic era

if you like your social life but you want this game you have to choose you arent allowed both
recommended
just another turn and ill stop playing your mind will repeat it untill you notice you havent eat for a whole day
recommended
one of the best in its class
recommended
this game is my favourite game at the moment its a good strategy game with a nice look to it not acurate to history at all if you dont use mods at least its very fun to play with friends try not to get too competative though
recommended
its pretty good 
recommended
turn based 4x strategy game is there anything more exciting and visceral nah but really tho this game is well goooooood ive spent way too much time on it its addictive also flip u henry with ur flippin chinese domination rush also buildin the great wall u scrub
recommended
fantastic game very addictive decided to play a few turns then it had been 5 hours
recommended
one more turn my  seriously do not think you are going to just quickly make a few turns in this game and go i once started playing at 8am thinking eh ill play a little bit and next thing i know it was 2pm and i was slaughtering the japanese mercilessly this game will cause you to get fired fail your classes get a divorce and nuke ghandi all at the same time i am serious here the commercials for this game do not lie and i have been apart of a civ 5 recovery group for a few weeks now 1510 would buy again
recommended
with no prior experience with these games i decided to try it i became hooked instantly just a couple of hours and you have a basic understanding i know people with hundreds of hours in this game still discovering new things 100% worth it
recommended
the most fun ive had in a long time 1010
recommended
best game to get if you wanna play against mates in a long battle loads of diferent ways to win and all you dont have to be agressive you can do waht you want with your country and i love it
recommended
if you like to spend hours playing as russia just to butt  america or any other equally annoying country get this game you start out as 2 units some  settlers and some soldiers who are ing terrible then you slowly build your way up to the point where you can nuke your enemies with little to no consquences the ai will hate you but who gives a  not this guy so after your done with you little nuclear holocaust why not start another game this time you can win a diplomatic victory which will never work out or you could win as a cultural victory which is boring as  same as the time victory
recommended
i would recomend starting at warlord difficulty for new peoples
recommended
play this if you can afford to become a neet its a very fun game but far too addicting to the point that your first gameplay will last you at least 1015 hours thats only the tutorial i would give this a 1010 but this game takes you far away from friends family and loved ones to the point of no return 810  would play it never again unless i suddenly had no one in the world
recommended
great game
recommended
very addicting game
recommended
love the series i am very happy with the linux port as well a must have game
recommended
civilization v is based around international diplomacy it is a turnbased strategy game that allows you to make alliances or enemies peace or war you can play as various empires from england to rome america to egypt each nation has a couple special things such as a special building and a special unit you can expand your empire by building cities and buying tiles you can go to war with nations to capture their territory or you can be neutral and never go to war you can start the game just after the invention of agriculture and from there you research new technologies starting with things like animal husbandry and ending with things like nanotechnology each technology unlocks new things to build and use for example researching mining allows you to build mines while researching industrialization allows you to build factories there are various difficulties to choose from so no matter your skill level you should enjoy the game the win conditions are various victory types for example you can take over everyone else through military and win a domination victory or you can launch a rocket to alpha centauri winning through a science victory there are other ways to win as well building wonders major buildings from history that each give unique bonuses and advantages allows you to dominate the score board there are many wonders that could be built such as the great library stonehenge the great wall the statue of liberty and the hubble space telescope there are two major expansion packs that you can buy gods & kings allows you to found your own religion and spread it around the world among other things and brave new world allows you to build trade routes and get involved in international diplomacy through the world congressunited nations other more minor dlc are available as well such as polynesia and korea civilization v also has mod support and mods are quite easy to make using the included civilization v sdk tool using this you can make new civilizations buildings technologies the possibilities are almost endless you can also download other peoples mods through the steam workshop my rating of it 1010  enourmous fun with a bit of history education hidden throughout  permits endless mods and mod possibilities  unbelievable amount of replay value  can be hard on the computer in the later parts of the game
recommended
one of the greatest strategy games i have ever played i recommend it to anyone interested in playing strategy games
recommended
this  ballin
recommended
i forgot about my life 1010
recommended
the best turnbased game i have ever played loved all the expansions and dlcs and dont trust ai ghandi
recommended

recommended
mildly beast
recommended
if you havent already try looking through the advanced game options there are some fun combinations that arent in normal game modes also try the mod community for more variety
recommended
its awsome if you like strategy games
recommended
i bought this game a week ago and in that weeks time i managed to clock more than 40 hours nearly every waking moment that i wasnt at work was spent playing this game thats kind of scary and i think im going to uninstall this and not touch it for a long time but thats in part because i think ive sort of exhasted most of what the game has to offer me at this point although the hex tiles are a huge improvement over previous games compared to civ 4 it feels like less of a strategy game and more of a tactics game and there are other games that do tactics better than civ 5 in terms of performance ive been playing on a sandy bridge i3 with integrated graphics and the game has been pretty smooth when using tactical view replaces all tilesunits with 2d icons which is how i have been playing the game for the past 20 hours but running the game in normal mode makes it run like molasses for me even when playing smaller games with 6 civilizations
recommended
the game seemed to lose its replay value for me after 350 hours but still 350 hours
recommended
i dont like strategies but this strategy is beautiful
recommended
i cannot effectively articulate how awesome this game is mind the system requirements but if you meet them play it
recommended
if you ask me none of the other civs seem all that civilized gandhi nuking my capital twice screw you gandhi
recommended
so fast paced 1010
recommended
if you like games where you can go to war explore the land create an empire and rule the world then you need this amazing graphics cool scenarios and a bunch of characters to choose from this is one of the best strategy games ive ever played get it its worth it
recommended
its not poochies
recommended
best sid meiers game by far it is a very fun game and u dont finish games to fast but it dosent take to long

start with nothing and build a global empire use diplomacy trade economic sanctions and brute force to expand over your foes reenact real life histrorical events such as ghandi being a  and nuking your cities in 1700 ad queen elizabeth lecturing you on your expansionist policies and much much more fun game to play but its such a time sync its unreal start a game at midday on a saturday and you wont have finished it by the next week fun & lengthy gameplay 810 would recommend
recommended
most awesome game ever
recommended
may not seem like fun but yet it is and addictive as  really recommend
recommended
really good game but you should get the dlc because it makes the game a lot better
recommended
justdownload the demo already then you can see for yourself why i spent 19 hours on my first match in a single 36hour period id be more precise if i could remember its kind of a blur

truely excellent eventually a marvelous sequel after poor attempts of civilization 3 and 4 this has the feel of civilization 2 but with greater depth and more thought put into fighting and cultural strengths and weakness would buy this game again and wouldnt regret it in a heartbeat

recommended
this game ia a plague first it looks fun and harmless but then you get addicted and cant stop playing save yourselfs
recommended
a lot of my friends myself included played previous installations of civ and fell in love civ 5 is the latest installation and while having a rough start has slowly progressed into a fun game i will admit the change in style was very difficult to get over i played many hours of civ 4 and when i started civ 5 it was a mixed bag i was so happy at the updated graphics the game looks gorgeous but it came at the cost of some reworking in the play style after getting used to the play style it doesnt mean as much but it is something to consider for prospective buyers that also being said another thing to consider is the hardware aspect this game is a memory hog and for some reason really hits hard on nonssd hard drives i had to put in extra 120mm fans on my case to keep the heat down the longer you play a game the slower the game runs if you have a high end gaming system youll be fine otherwise be prepared to start your game in midlow settings in graphics in order to accommodate for late game slowness
recommended
i was never a fan of the sid meier games but i guess 200 hours can change things d love this game
recommended
i have played a lot of civ iv not on steam and this game is a little bit different id say its a little bit easier since multiple religions dont make unhappiness and ofcourse we have global happiness now instead of city happiness overall i really like the game its simply addicting though the only stuff that annoys me is that you cant stack military units i dont say its bad its only that i didnt get used to it yet great game a strong 7510 from me best of turnbased strategy games
recommended
really good game and very addictive once you get the hang of it it becomes a amazing battle between lands
recommended
civilation v
recommended
1700 we blast off into space real life 2000 were working on it
recommended
one of the games worth playing
recommended
i liked this game great city management i liked the hitorical accuracy of the special units great people and leaders
recommended
is a fun game if you want to spend a long time to play if you enjoy management and strategy you will enjoy yourself there are very little amount of bugs and glitches but the game can run slow if you have a poor coomputer overall i would give this a 85 out of 10
recommended
possibly the best game i have ever played
recommended
an amazing addictive turn based strategy modding and multiplayer are incredibly easy to use brave new world is an awesome expansion if you havent played it go buy it now
recommended
probably my favourite game to play on the computer must get
recommended
i really like this game
recommended
cant stop playing after knew how to play100
recommended
civilization is one of the few games that is really worth its price you can keep playing it fo as long as you want and every time it will present you with chalenges and meaninful decisions not that 8 hours disposable crap you are used to buy it now
recommended
very fun just dont promiseone more turn to anybody while playing
recommended
one word epic
recommended
i went into playing civ 5 with a grain of salt civ4 was my very first computer game and i remember being real excited when its sequel was announced when i looked at many of the reviews for this game they were very negative saying that it was dumbed down and bad i got this game and i started playing if you expect it to be a superhard strategy game well youre going to be disappointed but i dont think its dumbed down it feels just like civ4 there are a couple new mechanics though none of them really effect gameplay in a big way however its still just as easy and entertaining as 4 the gameplay is simple which i found particularly nice considering that learning new mechanics would mess with my civ4 habits and yet is very engaging i started playing this worried whether ot not itd be worth it at about 1820 i stopped playing it at 2000 i felt like i was playing civ4 with more countries and some new features all in all civ5 no matter what you here is worth the money it has scenarios that i havent even delved into yet in my opinion they were one of the best part of 4 and warlords and plenty of mod support the graphics obviously are much better which gives you something a little prettier to look at as you build your country so what are you waiting for buy it actually buy civ4 first and then buy this
recommended
warning sid meiers civilization v is not for everyone including people with a sleep schedule a job a relationship or any iota of sociallife semblance side effects may include sleep deprivation paresthesia insufficientexcessive food intake vision impairment and induced mindcontrolsoul extraction chronic use can lead to visualing costs turns and production rates of buildings artworks and people as well as prolonged discussions with your socks shoes or other footwear occassionally civ 5 can lead to implusive purchases of airplane tickets to india inadvertently causing public disturbances by spewing profuse ragefilled threats of nuclear warhead usage and words of denouncement towards a man whos been dead for 60 years followed by detainment under police custody ask your doctor if its right for you
recommended
civ v is not every civ players cup of tea because it drastically changed civ from its original formula that said i prefer this formula no more stacks of doom gameplay and the new hex grid is much more aesthetically pleasing animated civ screens add a lot to the experience and make it feel less like youre playing against board game pieces and more playing against people civlopedia is great for people who love reading about any stuff about the civs that i didnt know without opening up wikipedia game mechanics are properly introduced to new players
recommended
it is an excellent game i highly reccomend to anyone that enjoys strategy
recommended
deep and satisfying game with interlocking systems and overlapping objectives making play extremely compulsive factions have enough subtle differences and individual personality that its always rewarding to replay as someone else and the way random maps build so many stories of which cities rise and fall through fortunate resources or the placement of agressive neighbours is a delight sometimes the excellent sandbox pieces fall just short of fitting into as great a game though computer opponents are never really smart enough to impress and higher difficulties increase the challenge more through unfair feeling bonuses rather than superior ai for all the intricate depth of the technology and culture paths and alternative victory conditions to aim for its also a bit of a shame that unless forced otherwise by setting extra rules a jackofall trades military strategy alway seems most powerful
recommended
this game this game i never thought i would ever like a strategic came like this it ended up being one of my favorites to play this year itll have you wondering why washington was a jerk and why south korea likes truffles so much 1010 i would buy this game again in a heartbeat
recommended
pure addiction like crack once you start you cant stop
recommended

addicting thats my oneword concept for this review sid meiers civilization v is addicting its like a drug you try it for the first time and you like it a little and tell yourself i can quit any time i want then a week and 5 civ sessions later you find yourself spouting the games mantra just one more turn the gameplay is fun and inviting in the early stages of the game lack of proper preparation can get you killed on the harder difficulty levels but its pretty forgiving on the easier difficulties and there is something oh so satisfying about ruling an entire empire especially in the later portions of the game when you have the entire world at your fingertips the graphics are much improved over previous iterations of the game the new hexagon tile system works better than the old square based system as well the ai is also better though still frustratingly simpleminded the amount of times theyve declared war on me for the simple act of making friends with other citystates is astounding speaking of citystates are a worthwhile entry into the series they add an entire new element giving you someone to barter with or an extra thorn in your side depending on how you play the game they can mostly be manipulated at will but the ease with which an enemy civilization can bring them into a war effort against you can be alarming most of the time they dont factor into a war very much but occasionally they will send out a unit to battle overall this game is fun inventive and rewarding to play but all of that only really tells you one thing this game is addictive

alltime favorite franchise highly recommended

i keep on coming back to civilization v for another play just like i have done since civ 1 the expansion packs have added to my enjoyment its easy to start playing and to learn the mechanics as you go the advisors are informative without being obtrusive it may take many hours to play an entire game on the bigger maps but its very easy to play a couple of turns when ive a few minutes spare my only gripe is how long loading a save game takes towards the latter stages of a game on huge maps
recommended
a great strategy game for singleplayer and multiplayer rule the world build a spaceship destroy a city with giant death robots and discover the new world in your first caravel just one more turn
recommended
great game however i am having a little trouble getting the steam workshop items to work on it please fix that
recommended
this game is addictive for any rts or worldbuilder fan the addition of the gods & kings dlc though truly makes this a musthave the gods & kings dlc completely rebalances and overhauls the game in too many ways to list starting with the wonders the buildings the units the combat system diplomacy navel warefare and adds religion and espionage elements to the game for the truly detailoriented rts gamers that enjoy maximizing their strategies there are few things left to critique with the g&k expansion now added other than perhaps the sheer length of time a standard turn game will require the only major issue consumers need to be aware the map pack dlc is for single player only which is unfortunately as multiplayer would greatly benefit from the revised fixed or tweaked stock maps it includes
recommended
is an awesome game when you start it its hard to stop
recommended
brillant game if you have got the time than it is worth buying it
recommended
great game it is fun multiplayer and singleplayer it goes on sale all the time as well so practically nobody has to pay full price
recommended
an excellent game im mainly doing this for the badge this game has served up hundreds of hours of my time and if you enjoy strategy and intelligent playstyle this game is for you although playable by the laidback consumer the game truly shines when one is a hardcore strategist and can enjoy exploring the mechanics of the game

recommended
i furtherly enjoy this game i play it almost everyday with my friend trevor we have played this alot i have like 65 hours on it
recommended
one of the best things about civ5 is its replayability advanced setup randomly generated maps and dozens of civs that all act uniquely this game never gets old even in the middle of a game theres always the next thing to do whether its to reseach a new technology make your cities happy or nuke your opponents into a firey oblivion ive spent entire days playing this game i regret nothing
recommended
one of my all time favorites
recommended
i became a banana empire and it was cool 1010

an absolutely fantastic and well made game hundreds of hours of replayability and fun
recommended
awesomei can stuck for hoursthe best turn based strategy game ever so far
recommended
this game is so much fun but very addicting people be like  i wanna play a first person shooter and glak people up i dont want to read charts and graphs and  screw people who say that this game is amazing you will start and end up playing a 10 hr game which isnt bad considering an average game on fast mode is like 7hrs long playing is so much fun and you will have a bunch of rememberable moments in every game playing with friends or random people is fun and competitive its basically a board game that is a perfect strategy game buy it because it is a great game 1010 easily many hours will be put in and it is worth the pay
recommended
this game makes my  rock hard
recommended
a game youll probably keep coming back to replayability over years in my experience
recommended
civilization is a fantastic series and v finally adds something the series always needed hexes with gods and kings it has included many refinements that makes this game the most challenging and difficult of the incarnations of this game update the brave new world incarnation changes faith and culture once more cultural victories are still the most common kind in my games since i tend to forgo warfare for technological advances i miss the cultural conversion of enemy cities that was part of civ iv but that was a conceit that does not generally fit reality
recommended
this is possibly the best strategy game ive ever played i recommend this game to any and all
recommended
good turnbased strategy
recommended
a fun and strategic game that allows you to build an empire though time i highly recommened this game its worth the money
recommended
missionaries of biggus dickus have spread their seeds through the world 1010
recommended
this game has added a new element to combat different to other civ games which is the innability to stack troops which i find adds a fundamental strength to the strategy of units
recommended
i think everyone should play this game because it is the best game on earth
recommended
the best game ever

recommended
you can fight gandhi i would fight gandhi
recommended
anybody who likes strategy games of any kind will love civ 5 the graphics are serene and the gameplay is flawless and addictive just dont expect it to be historically accurate youll soon find that gandhi is the most aggressive ai in the game never buy the game at full price though therell probably be a sale on a week later
recommended
civilization 5 is like the digital equivalent of marijuana and sugar mixed together you just have to pass one more turn you say it will be your last only now its 3 am in the morning and youre starting to bump your head on the keyboard as you try to fight the sleep just one more turn but seriously civ 5 is one of the most fun games that i have had the pleasure to waste hours and hours on it i would highly recommend it to everyone weather this is the first game they have ever played or if they are the most veteran of hardcore gamers the only people that i would not recommend it to are those who can not expend any more than a few hours or just really dont like turn based strategy games for whatever reason otherwise its simply one of those games that nearly everyone has at least tried or heard of like skyrim minecraft or the cod franchise now if you have no idea what civ 5 is actually about then dont worry because i have got you covered here civilization 5 is a essentially a turn based 4x explore expand exploit and exterminate game you always play on a map of your choosing which can be can have randomized or very customizable settings then you choose what civiliztion you want to play as with each having special bonuses or attributes starting with just two units a settler and a warrior the player founds a city which will be their starting point and expands from there you must reseach new technologies expand your deplomacy and build armies to defend yourself or attack other civilizations with there are can be several ways to win a match which can be also be customized usually either through researching ahead of the other civilizations uniting the civilizaions through deplomacy or conquering other nations now dont get me wrong civ 5 isnt perfect and there are a few things here and there that will invoke some frustration in particular the ai or other nonplayer civilizations is very lacking there is little to no tactices in how it wages war unless you count clustering random units at you in random formations its deplomacy is extremely predictable and nearly not worth caring for if they have more troops than you or you are so much as slightly ahead of them in research they will inexplicably wage war with you this happens all the time nearly no civilization is willing to find a diplomatic solution and they focus on bringing down other civilations before brinning up there own now dont get me wrong the ai isnt broken it is merely serviceable so if you dont mind then you wont get too frustrated other than this there are only a very few minor complaints that arent too big a deal sometimes you can get screwed if you dont precure a certain amount of specific resources like happiness gold or reseach you might start somwhere that wont allow the player to really expand and the other civilizations could eventually snowball you or over time the player could snowball the other civilizations easily if they get those resources and then the game becomes too easy but most of the time the game is fairly balanced and very much worth playing again i would recommend this to almost anybody and everybody now if you dont mind i need finish conquering france with my giant death robots
recommended
very nice game i am not good at it but i enjoyed it a lot buy it you wont hate it you will love it
recommended
i thought i would play for an hour then got off 2 days laterworth it
recommended
really fun to play
recommended
this game is the most stratigic game ever i give it 1010 the diplomacy screens where you talk to other civilizations and you get to interact with theam is flawless and beautiful and dont get me started on the battles the battles are a bit hard for starters you cant march to theam and win you need lots of troops to surround the city and shoot and bombard theam cause this game is like chess almost you get to attack and move every 1 turn once u move all your armys and farmers there are many factions to play but i recommen buying brave new world next after this for more factions where talking $60 dollors all togather so i say if you love stratigic battles and bored games of non stop enjoyment then this game is 100% for you
recommended
ill write this review 1 sec just 1 more turn
recommended
you should buy it
recommended
the best turn based strategy game
recommended
really cool game
recommended
dont like what some countries have done in the past wish some countries died off long ago civilization v allows you to play from one of over a dozen civilizations and leaders ranging from the democratic geroge washington to the war hungry genghis kahn from as early as 5000 bc customize the game as you wish setting options for random starts map sizes victory conditions play the game however you wish whether you wish to rule with an iron fist and dominate all others build the united nations and bring everyone together in peaceful coexistance or sit on the sidelines and either race for the most advanced technology or develop the culture of your civilization dont be discouraged from trying to do something even a militaristic civilization can bring force peace and a peaceful civilization can bring about destruction as a side recommendation several mods are avaliable to enhance gameplay ranging from new civs to new worlds to a game editor so you feel like a god be warned however many of the best or most popular mods require the expansion packs
recommended
this game is awsome great fun with friends
recommended
300 hours played nuff said gold edition $20 at eb games yarse 
recommended
one of the best editions of civilization ever
recommended
stop seriously stop think about how much time youve got to play if you have less than six hours play something that isnt this game for your own sake
recommended
civilization 5 is awesome from becoming the greatest empire of all time too becoming the greatest military force ever known cilivilization will keep you entertain hours on end
recommended
amazing territorial expansion is slower than civ 4 but it is still great
recommended
i purchased this game recently because a friend reccomended it to me i can definately see why he told me to get it i really enjoy the game and i plan to buy the dlc in the future while the game takes awhile to complete it is still very fun to play
recommended
i cannot recommend this game enough no other game allows you to feel as powerful or amazing as this game id recommend not having a job or anything though it sucks time into it like a black hole
recommended
this is my favorite civilization yet its beautiful fluid and still retains the just one more turn addictiveness the series is known for the music is outstanding as well with themes written for each country that shift and change as you progress through the game the new tactical warfare really makes a difference too gone are the stacks of doom from previous games its a meat and potatoes tactical addition that really sets this iteration apart from previous games imo its a mustown for fans of the series or turnbased strategy in general
recommended
this game ate up so much of my time its not even funny if youre looking for a strategic game to play solo or with friends get this the civilizations are great and the technology unlocks are just awesome the biggest feature that brings me back to this game is the fact that each time you start a new civilization you know the gameplay and the way you complete the game is going to be very different to the last game you played extremely recommended
recommended
multiplayer with friends slow sim 2014 with fun small talk and great moments 1010 single player nuke gandi 1010

recommended
the game itself is really good but if youve never played any civilization or something similiar before you shouldve try it out first maybe your friend has it because well personally i love turnbase strategy game so i thought this gamed be fun after playing a bit i can see why people are so addicted to this game but somehow i cant enjoy it probably because its too slow for me i regret buying this game but seriously try it if you like it this game is really worth the money
recommended
fun but it would most definetly be better with workshop support for the mac
recommended
civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played i definitely recommend that you buy it
recommended
a great 4x game that just keeps on getting better with each dlc cant wait for the latest one
recommended
its like a rts just with more civilized people
recommended
this is a fantastic game for rts lovers everywhere getting the expansions is a good idea as the majority of mods make use of both of them and really do improve the game a lot 1010 would play another turn
recommended
one of the best 4x games o ut there
recommended
for those who like to think
recommended
to tell the truth this game is just the best i have spent count less hours playing as different civs and having fun with each one and would wish for every one to at least try it
recommended
one of my favorite strategy games worth every penny
recommended
a fabulous game that simulates perfectly how awful ghandhi is
recommended
set a timer when you play civ v too many nights ive gone in thinking ill just play a couple of turns then go to bed four hours later i nearly crap my pants because the sun is coming up and i havent slept
recommended
good for anyone who loves strategy
recommended
i have two things to say about this 1 nuking your friends is fun 2 dont trust gandhi
recommended
started a new game at 3 pm monday 1 hour later it was wednesday

recommended

recommended
a really good turn based rts game if you liked the previous civ games or age of empire rise of nations youll like this
recommended
civilization 5 is an amazing strategy game with no equal the game can be played at a leisurely pace and comfortable difficulty all the way up to a mind melting marathon pace and the extremely challenging deity difficulty not only are the single player games fun challenging and well crafted but the online multiplayer adds a new dimension to the game with added challenges and excitement lastly the scenarios allow you to reenact some of historys greatest moments 1010
recommended
lots of replayability definitely recommend this

recommended
and old faithful game that gets better with each reworking i love this game and always have who does not like attempting world domination great new graphics and civs to play in
recommended
got nuked by gandhi 1010 best game of the year
recommended

recommended
as a person who is new to the civilizations series civ 5 is most definitely the best turn based rts to date it is a wonderfully complex game which has you thinking at every step of the way forces you to make the best use of all of your resources and formulate a strategy to to lead your civilization to victory it is such a diverse game that no two matches would ever be the same i would definitely recommend this one to rts fans
recommended
it is a good game
recommended
one of the most addicting games ive ever played
recommended
the best turnbased strategic game that i ever played i strongly recommend to buy both the expansion because thay make the game even better
recommended
ive always loved the civilization series and from what ive played of it this is a great new addition to the series
recommended
a very simplisticdeep strategy game its interface is extremely easy to use but it offers enough choice to keep things interesting it is also very well polished all the games leaders have their own cutscene whenever you talk to them in the the game and theyre well animated and bursting with personality everything works in the game too  i havent found a single glitch or bug since i started playing my only problem with the game is the lack of diplomatic options although the game has a decent selection it isnt as full as youd expect it to be for example you cant threaten to attack other nations unless they give you a certain resource etc there is also a slight problem with the games ai in a diplomatic sense as to avoid the problem of the ai just letting you walk all over them theyve been made to be very picky over what deals they accept this leads to some unusual situations like a leader refusing to end a war with you unless you pay them some gold despite them only having one city left with no troops while your massive army is waiting outside the city walls  waiting to invade them these are minor problems in a fantastic game though if you like the strategy games youll love this
recommended
a fitting continuation of the civilization legacy

recommended
must have for any strategic game fan or anybody in general one of the best games on pc
recommended
amazing turnbased strategic game think how to play evolve and conquer if you want you can aslo win by dominating another civilization using culture and religion raise an army train it and explore the world make deals pacts and betray your allies one more turn one more turn
recommended
it good but it is much much better with brave world & gods and king
recommended
very fun and incredibly engaging once ive started playing i only tend to stop when i havent eaten for most of the day
recommended
this game has been the best of the series yet <y first review so i will just say if you liked any of the series before please try this game there are always specials where you can pick up the base game or even gold edition cheap you wont be disappointed
recommended
this game is highly addicting where one more turn can quickly become another hour with a vast cast of powerful leaders from a wide variety of masterful civilizations this game is a must play for any fan of the strategy genre
recommended
highly addictive game that makes you want to keep on playing
recommended
a game surprisingly more tactical and militaristic than a civilization should probably be especially with nukehappy gandhi still a fantastic game would recommend
recommended
best civilization game i have ever played very very addicting and above all really fun
recommended
peaceful ghandi of india he declared global thermonuclear war on everyone 1010

probably my favorite game of all time and has great replayability i love the strategy involed as well as the different ways you can win the game i highly recommend
recommended
its hard to go wrong with civ but now 2 expansions in the game has really come into its own
recommended
the best time suck you can buy many hours have vanished while playing this game
recommended
bought it on sale a few years back and wasnt able to play it due to poop computer i have sense bought a new computer and i can say i will flunk out of my classes next semester because of this game
recommended
this is a real time strategy on such a scale i cant even beging to compliment it the graphics are simply amazing wonders are well detailed the histoical information in the civilopedia is great for light reading and the thought put into the units was wonderful i mean how many people knew about turtle ships and galeasses before playing this game also the sense of reality in the diplomatic relationships between civs is relativly realistic it is a challenging game but not impossible i like the five ways to achive victory as well overall 1010 stars and i cant wait to see how their latest game civiliation beyond earth turns out
recommended
a great game well worth its price after over 420 hours the game continues to offer great experiences both in single and multiplayer it truly is the best strategy game being offered today and well worth your money ps buy all of the expansionsg&k and bnw for a better experience
recommended
i try making peace of india but he nuke me why is india do this i suppose to be peace please fix but otherwise good gaming india make me cry at night because many nukes into capital and make me die one time i contimplating suicide because india nuke too much and when i vote to be ally they nuke me because i no make city of mine to them very good game though 1110 will get nuked by india again
recommended
dont play this late at night or you will be up until 5 am trust me
recommended
an immense amount of replayability any strategy fan will love this game and history buffs will most likely be interested the only thing that may deter people is the learning curve which there is a mild one i havent played any previous civilization games and it took maybe an hour at most outside of the tutorial to understand the deepest levels of the game that is not to say it is simple by any measure however the tutorial walks you through the game and there is even a setting to change your familiarity with the game and even new expansions while you are playing outside of the tutorial in a normal game this mechanic will be sure to easily introduce you to new game systems through a typical playthrough i purchased this and most dlc and expansions at full price and it is completely worth it any discount on this game and the rest of the content is definitely a mustbuy amazingly addicting gameplay and a unique and enthralling storyline that is written with every new game that is played one can never be bored with a game that has a dynamic workshop supported by creative community members
recommended
this game is my life for at least 10 hours at a time

the vanilla civ v is definitely still a great game but really only shines with the big dlc bnw and g&k the dlcs give civ v the replayability you look for in a civ game so if you can snag the whole bundle in a steam sale theres probably one of the best purchaes on steam you could make
recommended
i woke up in the wrong indian villiage

recommended
great game got addicted quickly

50 hours into your latest save all is going well only 3 leaders left gandhi caesar and washington you draft an end game plan in your mind you will make friends with gandhi for obvious reasons hes chill then procede to befriend caesar then you will take out washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior he must pay 20 turns later all is going to plan we are now on washingtons doorstep gandhi and caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation all we need to do is eliminate the pesky americans and ith all our military now on american soil this should not take long then after the swift invasion of america we will make a vote for world peace at the un in rome of course with our new found indian and roman brethren it is a sure win but all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start quickly they become louder and louder what is this you think to yourself a false alarm you shrug it off maybe caesae bombing a city state the game pauses gandhi appears on the screen with a sinister grin he shouts war in your face only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight the camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy the capital of your glorious nation you then hear a rumble just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine you realise it is too late you can only watch as the missle closes in as your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people then silence before what had just occurred had sunk in before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears suddenly countless stealth bombers appear seemingly out of no where soon the sky is blackened by planes the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains you faint from the shock of what is unfolding you awake shortly after gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire now with giant death robots making the most of his seemingly never ending turn as gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes whats left of your broken nation all you can do is weep your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn why oh why did you turn of autosave did it really speed your game up was it worth it ghandi is a complete  he acts like your friend but will nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself 1010

i am the peaceful nation of the celts we shall be the nation of religion and of diplomacy this went well we ended up next to the babylonians and we expanded nicely in peace however i have always believed in dibs so i placed down glasgow onto the land between us to provide a little buffer they seemed annoyed by this a few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years but otherwise nothing too bad happened in order to spread our religion further because we were known for our confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster we begin to invest in boats soon we covered the oceans in missionaries inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies babylon was making friends with a local city state genoa however they were trying to spread zoroastrianism those heathens despite both our religions being known for their peace we passiveaggressively sent missionary and inquisitor to genoa over the course of about 700 years we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions those same warriors had been given spears now but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders i offer babylon some sugar for their spice they wanted my sugar iron coal and all of my money i then asked germany if they wanted sugar for spice they accepted north of me rome had begun a war with france due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade i found myself with a huge amount of money everytime france and rome made peace i knew that rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes so i bought i gifted many city states my religion and gold and then i bought gifted france and germany enough money to declare with with rome while they fought my spearmen now musketmen continued to glare with babylons and we continued our 1500 year religious passiveaggression over genoa they said i was spying on them i said i wouldnt when my spies returned i sent them back to babylon a squad of 5 great prophets charged into babylon converting left right and centre babylon complained i was being a bit aggressive i apologised i then sent more missionaries to babylon i had now found every single civilization we decided to have a united nations meeting in 1600ad i as the host gave everyone a single vote except myself i gave myself 16 due to my popularity i declared my religion to be the world religion every one opposed i listened to their opinions and then passed it anyway when rome got angry about this i then paid france to declare war again when babylon got angry i then paid rome to declare war on them my civilians were amazingly happy hugely more than any other place but because i was an emperor they declared me declis the terrible despite my universal healthcare happy citizens peaceful religion not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word my army consisted of mostly my friends my city states and my musketmen now great war infantry continued to glare at the babylonian great war infantry after 2000 years a great duty to my nation their descendants shall continue to frown at the babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall eventually we reached a grand united nations meeting i sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 city state friends and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side i said that the peoples confucian republican empire of scotland was the best nation in the world they all voted against me i smiled and then declared i won anyway democracy is overrated freedom of religion only applies to my religion i dont need to be stronger when im more popular and my people are probably more beautiful and if you dont like me ill pay your best friend to backstab you through this i came to understand american foreign policy so civilization is if nothing else an educational tool

when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold dyes and ivory take my advice ready all your tanks and nukes arm them and shoot them like your life depends on it they are evil traitorous demons never trust them however genghis khan is my best friend he came up to me and was all like de full do bu la chi mendo and i said okay lets be friends i can never understand that guy but something about our relationship just works ghandi hating simulator 2014 1110
recommended
youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter 2010
recommended
prepare to spend 56 hours on this game without realizing youve been on for more than an hour one more turn really does become a mantra that dominates your thinking that said the number of possible game setups and possibilities results in nearly endless gameplay
recommended
the perfect game for strategic play
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played i should be past 300 hrs now and theres a good reason for that if you can manage to get a friend to play with you it becomes 10x better you can help each other and not to mention face each other to see who would run a country better i cant wait till civililization beyond earth comes out cuase im sure ill  aways the hours with that game to but overall amazing franchise with a newer version in the works so get started now if youre still contemplating wether to buy this game or not
recommended
this game is very cool  when you play it you not waste your time and when you playing it you will get the knowladge and the information about the history and the levolution of the thing
recommended
one more turn
recommended
easy to get lost in for hours on end
recommended
this game is fun and even more fun when you play it with friends and i really recomment it to people that like 4x games
recommended
best turn based strategy game ever
recommended
great game to spend some time on and think things over it may take a while for you to develop a strategy but multiple play throughs and lots of workshop content have a lot to offer
recommended
this game is really fun ive played it for a lot of hours it is really fun for a game to get addicted to
recommended
ghandi will say something about the peaceful indian people turn 499 so close to that time victory and then a nuke will hit you
recommended
this game is super fun and never really gets old that may just be because it takes forever but still lots of fun and imnot kidding i had like 8 hours of gameplay and i still hadnt finished one game a tip dont go attacking everybody or else theyll all hate you for being militarily unstable it wasnt my fault though america was right below me and they built atlanta right next to my wall and it all sort of escalated i kind of declared war on and off demanding cities in return for peace until i took over washington dc and half of the city states seriously my chinese civilization has like 15 cities anyway its very fun because you start out with so little and then watch it all grow into this massive empire of epicosity
recommended
never mess with rome 1010 prepare to have your life sucked away
recommended
one of the easiest games to hundreds of hours of your life to start playing at 5 or 6pm and the next time you look at the clock it will be 3am almost unlimited replayability with so many vanilla nations to choose from and the mods on the workshop encompass every aspect of the game
recommended
i need to waste more time on this game
recommended
say goodbye to your life
recommended
its fun and sometimes gets fast pace sometimes sometimes though it does get slow and boring but when you go for a domintation victory it takes forever and tons of people hate you you also have to be careful of a alliance forming from under you when you do anything
recommended
excellent game though at times it gets tiresome when other nations keep goign to war with you im talking about you gandhi
recommended
sort of hectic
recommended
i have been playing civilization since civ 1 this is by far the best part of the series though the series is slightly addictive can not count how many thousand hours i put into it best of all now available for linux 
recommended
great game even for people who dont usually like strategy games i was one of them lots of hours of play so be ready to sink in some serious time if you decide to get this
recommended
great game
recommended
great game best civ yet but still not as good as alpha centauri
recommended
civ v was my first turnbased strategy game and my first civilization series game and on both counts i couldnt be happier the strategy is compelling and detailed with many options and playstyles available the variety of bonuses and unique units available to each civilization allows for a great deal of replay value and randomized elements in the maps and ais contribute to a fresh start with every game there are some downsides however although one of the biggest draws to civ v is the complex and highly variable strategy options the ai programming leaves much to be desired as an ai simply cannot account for the many different levels of strategy needed to achieve victory as such the difficulty settings feel somewhat lackluster as they simply give the ai greater and greater early advantages leading to a very different gameplay at high levels compared to a truly even playing field combat like with many games is clunky and timeconsuming and although there are elements of strategy and maneuvering it can be boiled down into essentially a numbers game of tech and manpower rather than true strategic prowess multiplayer is also less than ideal particularly in a mixed humanai environment as ai features are severely nerfed or nonexistent in terms of fluff i find the pseudohistorical theme to be a huge benefit as im just enough of a historylinguisticsgeography nerd to find it interesting but not condescending or painfully inaccurate the alternate history line allows for a lot of freedom when of course the game will not reflect a reallife history ultimately though ive sunk many many hours into this game and i can see myself continuing to play well into the future especially considering the price is quite reasonable for comparable game quality and style i would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy history or just having a good time i particularly recommend it as a solo game  for those of us who dont care for online multiplayer civ v is by far the most rewarding singleplayer steam title ive come across
recommended
civilizations 5 is an amazing game i would reccomend this game to everyone it might be hard to start of with but once you know what your doing you will have a lot of fun its also got multiplayer so you can play with friends ive got 67 hours on record of this game and still havent got bored of playing it
recommended
each game can take upwards of 6 to 8 hours but you will remember your empire days weeks even months after you finished the match
recommended
i bought this game recently and already sunk nearly 200 hours into it amazingly well structured sim
recommended
love playing the ruler over people then grab civilization v continues to be a great series of games
recommended
i was gonna go to work but then i played civ 5 1010
recommended
solid game with approachable curve but needs dlc to achieve same levels of depth as previous games
recommended
excellent game kept me and my friends going for hours
recommended
if you like your social life dont get it 10000000000000000000000000010 would lose all my friends again
recommended
y yu no make hotseat multiplayer still a great game tho
recommended
trying to get a summer badge but either way i would recommend this game
recommended
endless hours of entertainment right here
recommended
spent lots of time on this and love it
recommended
a few significant strategical deficiencies exist in the base version of civ v the game is genuinely unbalanced without both the brave new world and gods and kings expansion packs if you can get the whole civ v package for a reasonable price go for it but i do not recommend purchasing the base game by itself
recommended
this is one of the best strategy war games i have ever played love the brave new world dlc adds lots of needed features to the game boudica ftw
recommended
this game is beyond amazing im not really into strategy games myself but this game changed that completely i would totally recommend this to anyone regardless of if theyre into strategy games
recommended
songhai and india cannot be trusted you have been warned
recommended
such a great time waster i can get sucked in for hours without even realizing it
recommended
most addictive game ever made if you enjoy turn based strategy games this one should not be passed up
recommended
<3 this game
recommended
this games single player is fun but its strongest feature is the multiplayer if you have friends who already own this game do not hesitate to buy it yourself as it is a great game to strengthen relationships or in some cases break them
recommended
now i am become gandhi destroyer of worlds 1110
recommended
this is one of the best games i have played in my years of gaming a really good strategy game that is different every game

recommended
i was forced to buy this game ok
recommended
one of the best strategy game on the market
recommended
this game is as addictive as chocolate to a fat kid you can play for hours on end without knowing time has even passed it just feels good when you can completely destroy another civ after a hundred turn war it is a long game with massive replayability i cant play this enough <3
recommended
suddenly the heavens are consumed by an eerie pitch black veil rain begins pelting the deck of the ship shredding the sails a burst of lightning brightens the dark sky revealing a modern age gandhi piloting a carrier plane about to unleash his payload on my renaissance era ship before i can gasp in astonishment the timeless warlord reduced the ship to a pile of debris floating down into the depths of the ocean the last of the rain fades away to a distant rumble and the dark clouds float away with tears rolling down my face i describe my exprience in civ1010 would play again
recommended
this game is awesome if you like thinking accrueing masses of money or waging numerous wars for no reason get this game
recommended
very fun game especially with all of the dlc at least g&k and bnw and the extra civs lots of playability and really fun for rewriting history in any way you want
recommended
this game is amazing i loved it the strategy is fun and it is complicated but not too complicated the ai are good at playing the game which makes it alot of fun there is a lot of depth in buildings units technologies social policies and civilizations there is also a great fan base that create great mods and are always willing to play multiplayer
recommended
when i first played civ5 before all the dlcs and expansions it sucked had nice graphics the revamped combat system was great a single square filled with 50 infantry tanks a nuke and artillery doesnt make much sense limited victory options amass culture and then build a wonder no forms of goverment ideologies sucked in the vanilla no religion no religion it was a game with great potential and had sady fell short tried a few games and got bored pretty fast then came gods & kings with religion and finally the game got back on track it felt like the old days as if sid was back on business that notion didnt last long since the experience still left me wanting steam workshop was on those days if im not mistaken nice addition but it was still not enough it felt like an incomplete game then came in the brave new word with all its glory patched up the holes and took the gameplay to a whole new level in my eyes cant say im not bitter about the whole deal since after getting the expansions it finally felt like a complete and polished game still im glad i tagged along it was one hell of a ride
recommended
lots of fun when you start playing though be prepared to spend the whole day in your chair lol every time i play i end spending at least 10 hours per session
recommended
highly recommended a game that will teach you while entertaining you at the same time varied difficulty settings make it a pleasurable experience for beginners and strategy veterans alike
recommended
endless fun whether youre alone or can convince some sucker friends to play with you its essentially virtual risk on crack the biggest problem with this game is remembering to get some sleep just one more turn
recommended
takes a long time but its a fun adventure
recommended
do you want a really addictive turn based game well buy this game and you play it alot
recommended
great game
recommended
if you dont already have this game pick it up g&k and bnw recommended
recommended
dont trust ghandis lies  prick
recommended
this is good you should all buy it be sure to get the expansions they add quite a bit
recommended
this game is incredibly addicting for many reasons it offers many of the features found in a masterfully designed strategy game or just any game in general the difficulty the multiple ways to win and the informative tutorial and instruction with little to no handholding and of course legitimate multiplayer first in difficulty there are five difficulty levels i may be wrong but there are at least 5 for the three that i have played lowest middle and highest i can confirm that they all offer unique experiences and dont just tweak simple stats like increasing enemy speed or strength it actually changes the artificial intelligence of the game to make the cpu opponents smarter instead of harder next the informative tutorial is litterally an entire dictionarys worth of instruction for each individual thing brought to you at appropriate times at a player defined rate it doesnt force you to do anything it just provides useful insight on gameplay to teach new players how to play and teach experienced players new tricks also there are many ways to win offering the player to journey of on his or her own path i believe there are 5 or more equally difficult ways to achieve difficulty offering tons of replayability trying to achieve each goal at least once and then trying to achieve those goals again at a higher difficulty and so on finally it offers legitamite not thrown in for marketingcough assassins creed cough multiplayer let me tell you it is so much fun to team up and battle against your friends its almost a game in its own instead of going into detail who doesnt want to create your own civilization from a pack of settlers with a buddy or two or ten enough said in conclusion buy this game seriously you wont regret it the only hidden cost is hours of your time
recommended
you can be ghandie the warlord 1010
recommended
one of the best single players games out there once you get some friends to play with you it is 10 times better but its still amazing either way
recommended
this game is so fun i recommend all of the dlc they completely change the game by adding a ton of new stuff that will make your experience even better there are many civilizations to choose from and they all have their unique perks you can spend hours on this game without realizing it 1010 would play forever and ever
recommended
i great strategy game that you chose the outcome of your civilization and others i would highly recommend this game to anybody who wants to play a strategy game
recommended
play as your favourite civilization through this grand strategy game endless fun its in the top 10 games for a reason 1010 make sure you have the latest expansions they are well worth it
recommended
as a huge fan of games like age of empires i figured that civ v wouldnt be much different i hadnt played any of the other civ games when i jumped into civ v and boy did i love it the game play is lots of fun and there is good level of strategy involved though the difficulty is easy to control when starting the game there are so many options and variety that its almost impossibly for me to get bored most fun is the ability to play with friends nothing says friendship like attacking with the full force of your military d
recommended
i have spent way too much time in this game and have survived the trial and error that was multiplayer it now works but put in place a pact to finish games you start and be cutthroat
recommended
amazing loads of fun
recommended
ive only played about 70 hours but its enought to tell me that this was one of the best buys i have ever made the civ 5 strategy may not be the most advanced or detailed but it is definitely exciting and easy enough to adjust to the many different legends who command their civilizations to greatness is also a perk each civilization has their own distinct advantage that can be used to help in whichever type of win you want the unitys are well balanced and the gameplay as said buy this game and all the dlc its a definite buy and if more dlc comes out i will be extremely interested in it 910
recommended
the best game of all time
recommended
i love all the civilization games i justi dont get why turns have to take forever the later into the game you go whyyyyy
recommended
this game is the
recommended
lots of fun if u have da hours
recommended
ive played this enough to fully appreciate the quality and depth of this game it is well made an a worthy installment to the civilization series it isnt perfect but diamonds in nature dont come clean and cut graphics are solid at max settings water effect is dazzling at times and watching my slaves er i mean unionized workers hammer away to build my roads always brings a grin to my face combat animations are fun and unqiue to unit types but occasionally they do get repetitive especially when there is one stubborn barbarian using your soldiers heads like golf balls one animation i really think they did well on is the atomic bomb although i may be biased because watching that go off on my foes capital does make me chuckle heartedly i swear im a nice a guy gameplay is exquisite i find especially after the inclusion of brave new world there is a game style for almost any type of player as well as a civilization that goes along with it you like to be aggressive and burn down your friends countryside and country people well the zulus are for you if theyre your neighbour you know you need big walls is building large empires and just blobbing out your thing well im certain being the emperor of rome is the job for you more of a hidebehindbigfreakingcitiesandlaughbecauseyourideologyisdestroyingenemyhappinessandpurposeinlife type of person well you still have a hard time because troops win games but you can definitely be a big world power throwing your propaganda at poor unsuspecting civs with the beardedbrazillian mind control technique or tourism as this game calls it the amount of dynamic things you can do and experience with this game is great and i would say it is defnitely worth experiencing for everyone a sidenote on gameplay is especially if you dont like to build many early units is always be prepared to be suddenly sad in the early game most of all play this game like simcity with disasters turn on hide your workers hide your great people and hide your settlers because barbarians be pillaging your improvements out here interface can be a bit confusing if youre not used to it but seeing as you are with it most of the game it gets pretty convenient to use and the controls are intuitive so i dont see too much mucking about happening if youre getting into games like this this is probably one of those games i would love to play on a touchscreen that i converted into a table top be all futuristic commanderlike anyone else mom just me if youre looking for a great easygoing timespending game this is a great one for that it also has some nice multiplayer so it can be a party the replayability is very vast due to the immense possible combinations and randomly generated maps the mods also add a fantastic singleplayer experience conquering virtual westeros has never been more fun i give this game two thumbs up sadly steam only lets me do one i probably forgot to mention and go over a few things but just felt like doing this on the fly hopefully its bearable thanks for reading
recommended
1010 would buy again if for some strange reason steam doesnt exist in the future
recommended
i love this game but i suspect it may be a time machine i have started many a game before bed and before i even have the chance to notice it is already morning
recommended
this game takes time and bends it in every way possible wake up at 8am and next minute its 8pm 
recommended
this is a fun game when played with friends easy to learn and set up multiplayer games
recommended
fun game havent played a multiplayer with people game yet but have still put in many hours conquering the world
recommended
quit your job drop out of college have one last night of fun with your mate and say goodbye to time  this game will bring you into a new dimension play at your own risk
recommended
although sometimes it may be a bit slow at times it is incredibly fun alone or with friends
recommended
its really good both single player and multiplayer have mods which make the game wayy more fun and the features are all polished and cool however there are still a couple bugs which have been in here for soo long and havent been fixed but all in all its pretty good
recommended
simply awesome
recommended
gameplay 55 builds stress at all the right times and certain ai add extra flavor graphics 45 takes a bit of time and tinkering to run smoothly and your computer definitely will get a little toasty but this is made up for by the stunning amount of resources the game can handle at once design 55 the devil is in the details and civ is packed with bells and whistles on every tile the ui can appear daunting at first but in the long run becomes incredibly simplistic sound 45 the score and narration really enhance the immersion and make your civilizations story all the more epic multiplayer 35 the only aspect of the game that is just average the graphics and amount of ai the game can handle take a significant blow in multiplayer and the way the game freezes entirely if youre at war with another player and its their turn can be frustrating the lack of achievement support in multiplayer is also a bit disappointing pc factor 55 the mod support is absolutely fantastic and propels this game to be a staple of pc gaming replay factorachievements 55 by the end of one really long game you will have a full understanding of how to play and be ready to rack up another hundred hours over the course of two days this game will make you think thats possible civilization v is the kind of game that may lead you to rehab but thatll only hurt your loved ones and youre two turns away from learning how to build a giant atomic robot so who cares overall 89
recommended
great game if you like turn based strategy especially fun when playing with friends 55
recommended
gud game >_> unless you play with my friends
recommended
civilization 5 is highly addicting and is a very good choice if you want to make a lot of time disappear before you even realize it was gone if youve tried the previous civilization titles and didnt find them fun give civlization 5 a try it plays more like a strategy board game then previous titles
recommended
all is fair in love and not now you barbarian keds
recommended
one of the best strategy games ever i never get bored playing this game i always come back and play more of it i highly recommend this game 
recommended
what can i say about the best turn based strategy series multitouch support rocks hex tiles are great its as great as previous versions offering huge civiliopedia to teach you actual history stealing your precious life with never ending one more turns your average strategy game ends in 1 hour while civilization might not end in months not everyone can play this game can you build an empire to stand the test of time
recommended
this is a really fun game i have had no problems with it 
recommended
this is one of the best strategy games ive played it is impressively immersive and quite addictive so make sure you watch your clock and dont end up accidentaly playing it until 430 in the morning
recommended
civ 5 is one of those games that you can just never get away from
recommended
for a game that i would think was going to be sorta boring i was wrong this game provides the fun that i enjoy greatly i will also add when you start playing this game youll lose track of time for real although the game mechanics could get better because the same thing happens everytime where you research a thing and then build this and that but its enjoyable for this game a 8 out of 10 is deserved guess ill start rating games now that ive said that
recommended
is good game yes
recommended
fun game but iits flawed without its dlcs
recommended
great
recommended
awesome game to lose track of time and play for hours on end
recommended
good game lots of replay value and lots of mods in the workshop
recommended
great game it seems like it would be really boring at first but i ended up playing this for 5 hours straight the night i bought it as you play you learn more about the inner mechanics of the game and you start molding your personal strategy for success
recommended
this game has amazing replayability on its own but woth steam workshop it never gets dull
recommended
a very good multiplayer experience as well as single player truly worth every penny spent
recommended
too many hours spent on this game 1010 would waste day on for one more turn again
recommended
you can nuke gandhi in this game 1010
recommended
absolutely glorious game to play when your abusive parents lock you in a dark room with only a computer with this game installed 69400000 i burn down cities

i really like it my wife and i are waiting for it to go on sale again and we plan on buying it for her to play also the dlc looks great too
recommended
great game
recommended
having played every iteration of the civilization franchise since the first one in 1991 i can honestly say this is the best one ever made and not just because of improved graphics im talking about gameplay balance and the feeling it gives you that this is a huge deep complex world my one and only gripe is the excessively long load timesi had to install it on the ssd and even there it takes 15 seconds to load but thats better than 23 minutes
recommended
this is probably one of my alltime favorite games i can spend the entire day playing this game as you can see i have over 500 hours into it easy controls you only need your mouse it is a simple fun fast turnbased military economy nation simulator with thousands of fun mods to pick from to play with from the steam community i highly recommend this game to anyone interested worth the money and also the expansion packs to this game it seems like a lot of money to buy it all but at the end it is worth it
recommended
an awesome game of strategy it can be diffiucult at times but is a fun all the same
recommended
this game is the epitome of global conquest and strategy games although it is turn based it keeps you interested and intent on taking over the globe the ai has improved tremendously and can be extremely challenging it features multiple difficulties for beginners and experts and every type of intermediate out there this game even has a multiplayer so buy and we can battle or work together to rule the world
recommended
aw yiss
recommended
sid meiers civilization v some of the best money ive ever spent hours poured into this game i do not regret it and neither will you when you try out this game combine it with gods and kings and brave new world for maximum enjoyment factor just a warning the game is rather resourceintensive so it may lag on lesser computers have fun
recommended
its a good game overall only problems are that its hard to finish games due to connection issues and the players themselves
recommended
it makes me horny
recommended
this is the best gamer ever
recommended
this is a great game but i think the best way i can describe it as being historical chesswith the a wide range of mods to allow you to play with a wide range races and contries
recommended
this a good one maybe this is where my life went
recommended
took me awhile to get out of my hilly base it was looking pretty bleak getting across that valley but we got it done somehow but then ggd out before we could break out our ak47s to pull out the w never even found out who my enemy was eventually i renamed my towns name to tyrezeshiddick cuz it was getting preeeetty boring unreality tazzzyloosepoundite i give this game a solid 610 its hard to get a good review out of me the only games that i have given above a 710 are arma dayzed terraria zombies survival stories ufc fight round 26 and sid meiers 2 so survive our night guys

recommended
this is the best strategy game ever i have to admit i cant stop playing it nothing is more fun than being able to be your favorite civilization then conquering the world with them amazing game buy it
recommended
very in depth although there are some massivly overpowered civs like russia just as warning ghandi is not your friend past the atomic era
recommended
this is a brillant game for people with a bitlot of spare time with is beatiful grahpics and amazing featurers watch your civilization grow sorry for te cheeseyness also if theres any spelling errors
recommended
did strategy wrong got nuked 1110 would boink
recommended

recommended
very addicting due to its unpredictableness and your ability to choose to build your civilization however you want it 1010 stay up playing most nights
recommended
this game is very fun and addicting i would reccomend it to all those questioning whether they should buy it or not best $20 i have spent in a long time
recommended
a unit needs order
recommended
love this game you say to yourself one more turn but then it becomes 20 then 100 the only advice i have is to not trust gandhi
recommended
this game is amazing if youre not playing it you need to
recommended
i absolutly love it just such a superb commbination of stratagy historysort of and city domination in my opinion brave new world has just made civ 5 even better with the addition of great people better trading and more civs
recommended
if you like your social life but you want this game you have to choose you arent allowed both
recommended
work what work i dont have a job anymore
recommended
incredibly addictive strategy game that requires a hell of a lot of patience gnk and bnw are both incredible dlc packs as well if you can stomach a game that lasts 10 hours but enjoy the freedom and fluidity of the timeline have at it
recommended
there are not enough hours in the day
recommended
im currently caesar destroying ethiopia in battle i also push my religion of threelegged man and my beautiful massive market onto every neighboring nation its a good way to spend a week
recommended
extremely fun but the gameplay mechanics are very buggy for example in multi player when you send someone a trade offer they can change it before you can say yes or no meaning that they can take your city
recommended
that moment you realize that you are next to ghandi
recommended
blew up an empire with an atomic bomb 1010
recommended

i furtherly enjoy this game i play it almost everyday with my friend trevor we have played this alot i have like 65 hours on it
recommended
one of the best things about civ5 is its replayability advanced setup randomly generated maps and dozens of civs that all act uniquely this game never gets old even in the middle of a game theres always the next thing to do whether its to reseach a new technology make your cities happy or nuke your opponents into a firey oblivion ive spent entire days playing this game i regret nothing
recommended

awsome game
recommended
i would say buy this game but that would be dumb then again so is this review im dumb buy the game its fun
recommended
i really dont know where to start with this being able to put into words how i feel about this game is actually a little bit difficult but i can say that it is my absolute favorite game now at the beginning when this game was just released civilization iv surpassed it in several ways seeing as this game was missing some huge features like religon and the like by the release of the gods and kings expansion i had grown to love this game as much if not more than civ iv but with the release of brave new world it surpassed civ iv it surpassed many of my favorite games taking its rightful place as my favorite game the game covers the creation of the world from the discovery of agriculture and the first settlements to present day you are the ruler of one civilization and you start with a settler who builds your first city and another unit typically a warrior of sorts and from there you can run your people however you want you can focus on creating the mightiest military and crushing your foes you can focus on diplomacy and getting citystates to do your bidding maybe you want to focus on culture and produce magnificent works of art there is so much to do and you can dabble in pretty much all of it its really something else all of this is built around a turn based strategy game unlike many 4x games though figuring out how to play civilization 5 is fairly easy the tutorials are useful and easy to read but even if you dont bother reading them the ui makes everything quite straightforward describing the game probably makes it sound a little bit dry and you know what it may not be everyones cup of tea but playing is believing the game really has an addicting quality of it you might say just one more turn and then ill quit and then three hours later youre nuking the iroquois to stop them from building the last spaceship part before you can win the un election youve worked so hard to achieve as venice each game is exciting and can be different from the last its great please get yourself this game in particular the complete edition is fantastic which includes all the dlc civs and the two amazing expansions it really is a fantastic game
recommended
its pretty fun
recommended
literally cannot stop playing a very fun game to play to relax and enjoy yourself multiplayer is also really fun with lots of people i would definitly suggest this game to anyone i meet
recommended
wasnt too hot on this game when it came out compared to civ4 but the gods and kings and brave new world expansions bring it over the top while the combat grid system is a breath of fresh air to the series im still not too keen on how slow units seem to be generated its definitely more of an altvictory tilted game which suits me just fine the variety and subtlety in gameplay definitely gets the just one more turn seal of approval from me
recommended
if you have 10 hours or so free id take the opportunity to have a quick game of civ
recommended
decent base gameget the 2 expantion packs to get the full experience
recommended
amazing and addicting
recommended
a grate game just lose for civ ii who was the first civ game i played this game have a love of community content like maps civs and game modes the just one problem is the multiplayer mode who never should exists this game type wont be made for multiplayer
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played play it on the weekend otherwise you will wake up late for work or school scored it for 10 on summer sale win
recommended

recommended
fantastic game very addictive decided to play a few turns then it had been 5 hours
recommended
one more turn my  seriously do not think you are going to just quickly make a few turns in this game and go i once started playing at 8am thinking eh ill play a little bit and next thing i know it was 2pm and i was slaughtering the japanese mercilessly this game will cause you to get fired fail your classes get a divorce and nuke ghandi all at the same time i am serious here the commercials for this game do not lie and i have been apart of a civ 5 recovery group for a few weeks now 1510 would buy again
recommended
with no prior experience with these games i decided to try it i became hooked instantly just a couple of hours and you have a basic understanding i know people with hundreds of hours in this game still discovering new things 100% worth it
recommended
this games preatty epic you can win by compleating the utopia projgect compleating the space race being the most successful by the year 1900 or my favorite becoming warlord and nuking everything mwahahahahah
recommended
if you buy this game you will lose your girlfriend your job and all your friends be prepared its just one more turn
recommended
great game
recommended
these games take sooo long but you dont realize and suddenly its thursday great game nonetheless and i recommend it to anyone who has friends and time on their hands
recommended
what do you want me to say about the civ saga you must buy the complete collection if you want to enjoy the full civ v experience tourism trade religion new civs lots of fun
recommended
when i first got this game i ended up staying up 2 hours later than i thought i would to play it lets just get to the point this game is fantastic and you should purchase it i reccomend you get the complete version  it adds some extra civs maps ect and the two main expansions brave new world and gods and kings add new wonders units religion idealology and just make the game even better
recommended
great game
recommended
best game ever highly reccomended to people looking to invest hours into a game
recommended
in this game you can build an empire spread a religion or my personal favourite build and use massive stockpiles of nuclear weapons
recommended
this is an excellent game for those who enjoy conquering other countries i dont know if its your hobby or whatever but it should be have fun
recommended
ive put hundreds of hours into this game it is simply amazing
recommended
i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based games whether you have the dlcs of not although obviously better if you do have it is still a very enjoyable game with lots of different playstyles that can succeed a great game in general 1010 also if you wait for the summer sale it is usually 5080% off on sale or not its a great game this game is bound to keep you sitting for a few hours at least its that addicting pros if you dont like a feature you can turn it off in the options for most at least the graphics are pretty but if you dont like it you can decrease it or go into strategic mode its a great way to  off your friends by stealing wonders <3 the large variety makes the game unique and each game is different different difficulty levels depending on your talent maps are generally well generated just about everything cons the games arent very quick they take a long time but they are definitely worth it just play over periods of time very long tutorials for slower computers the game takes a little bit longer to load and open in comparison to other games the leaders of all the nations arent that well balanced ie washington [america] vs sejong [korea] gandhi will nuke you one day
recommended
this game is a confusing game at first using the tutorial section of the game i was able to slowly build up my skill as a civ player i have enjoyed it playing against the ai and my friends it never gets old as you can make allies and well as enemies along the way to creating your perfect civilization summary fun playing against the ai lots of civs to play as easy to get the hang of can be a bit stressfull if you are getting beat by the difficult ai 8510
recommended
must play just never trust gandhi
recommended
great game for history  like me who just want to soak in all the indulgences of helotic civ
recommended
beware playing with war mongers fun multiplayer singleplayer boringish 7910 tip for pros only  rush nuke tech for e z win
recommended
amazing game very indepth and great game style 1010
recommended
i love it very addictive very good with all dlcs all of them
recommended
dont trust gandhis innocent face he will shove a nuke down your throat
recommended
one of the best turn based strategy games ever created
recommended
just one more turn thats the phrase the has been uttered by almost everyone who has ever played a civ game this game is no exception the music is tailored to the civilization you play the graphics are beautiful the strategy is intense you will find yourself plotting your next victory whether it is through military force economic maneuvering or scientific research different ways to win or lose so position your forces and click next turn
recommended
this game is fantastic wether you are playing with or against friends or just playing by yourself it makes you have a sense of accomplishment through completing the smallest of tasks this game also does not have a campaign wich reallly makes the player concintrate on having fun instead of beating the game also when playing with friends it does not create teams you decide if you want to win the control of civilizations through war or diplomacy the player decides who he wants to befriend or declare war with i have a fealing that this will eventually ruin a few friendships
recommended
seriously have paid pennies per hour for the gameplay ive gotten out of this game buy it
recommended
endless replay potential hence the 1000 hours logged 
recommended
make sure you do not buy the original game on its own buy the game bundle with all the dlc far more worth it and you save a lot of money in doing so buy the original game and the dlc separately is a major rip off
recommended
there are not words for how much time i have spent on this game it is amazingly addictive suggestion find someone to marry who also plays civ its the only way
recommended
so addicting raising a nation and choosing how you will take over the world is such a detailed process that you can take hundreds of different routes to achieve it in this game the amount of choices and control you have over every aspect of the game is incredible would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys turnbased strategy 8510
recommended
cant really go wrong with old sids games can you
recommended
very good game but games usually take several days to win
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is a slightly complex turn based strategy game that can be enjoyed by all gamers a fun and interactive map allows players to manipulate their surroundings in order to achieve their goal teaming up with friends in order to dominate enemy civilizations is a remarkably enjoyable experience
recommended
just one more turn completely losing track of time is a pretty strong indication of whether a game is good in my book and civilization 5 may be the best by that metric as a newbie to the civ series managing a society through the ages had sounded a bit daunting but thankfully the game is very intuitive for series beginners the visuals narration and music are all pitchperfect evoking a grand ambience fit for a game about world conquest individual games can take hours but it never feels tedious or repetitive computer opponents seem to have plenty of personality and multiplayer with friends is a blast i realize turnbased strategy games may not be for everyone but it would be difficult for me to find someone i wouldnt recommend this game to
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
let me get one thing out of the way here at the start of the review if you dont have time to put hours into a game then civilization v may not be for you heck if you enjoy having a life outside of a game then this might not be for you i say this because once you sink your teeth into civilization v its easy to loose track of time and become completely engrossed in your quest to build your civilization so let me first give you my background in playing civilization games which is a short one i played the last two games civ iv and civ revolution and enjoyed both of them quite a bit when i started looking at some of the early previews of civilization v i have to admit i wasnt sure i was ready to put the time and strategy into the world of civilization however from the opening load screen and the first few minutes of my first game i was instantly brought back to remembering why this is such an impressive franchise for newcomers to civilization civilization v may be one of the best games to get into the game has an incredible tutorial and also will help you in your first games with helpful hints throughout either way if you have not played a civilization game before this game seems well suited to hold your hand and then let you on your way one thing that i found especially useful for me was the advisors in the game who basically give you tips on areas you should focus on in your civilization you dont have to take their advice but often times they will all agree on one topic and that usually should be a solid indication that you want to address that area one barrier of entry that firaxis broke down in civilization v was the menus throughout the game where in previous games you were often left wondering what to do next this is by far the userfriendliest experience i have experienced in any civilization game even as some one who has played civilization games in the past i was very impressed with how approachable things were in this game everything just felt far more intuitive then in past games what stood out to me most about civilization v was not only how accessible it was but how great of a strategy experience it manages to be there is no denying that you can spend a whole day on just one game of civilization in fact unless you really have the stamina to play all day most games will span over the course of a couple of 5 hour sittings civilization v like civ games before it has this way of engrossing you into the story even if there isnt an already established plot you create your own plot your own direction and your own goals sure the game does give you hints on how to get the desired outcome but the strategy is so dead on that you have the ability to go your own way to your desired outcome a lot of the talk around civilization v before the games release was on the new hexagon setup which to be honest is a change for the game but nothing that really changes the way you play the game this is a turn based strategy game through and through and to be honest it is one of the best strategy games i personally have ever played graphics without a doubt civilization v has a much stronger visual presence then what we had in past civilization games the graphics have never been a big part of the civilization experience however that all changed in this game visually this is a stunning game it has a great mechanic to switch from strategy views to just a global view if you prefer to look at the game as more of a grid you can do that if you want to look at the game as a living world you can do that as well this is by far the best looking civilization game out there and it once again lessens the blow of how expansive of a strategy game it really is fun factor for newcomers to the series there is of course going to be a learning curve no matter how good the tutorial is however for seasoned veterans to the series you will be able to jump right in and take advantage of one of the most enjoyable games of strategy i have ever played what is even more exciting about civilization v is that you not only can play offline but can play online with friends there is also going to be an evergrowing population of mods to the game that will continue to increase replayability lets face it though i have not played two games of civilization that ever felt even remotely similar each game feels like a brand new experience overall civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played there are some issues but those are so minor in comparison to all the great things firaxis has done to not only make this accessible to new players but even returning players as well i can say with great confidence that you will not get a better game of strategy right now then what civilization v has to offer it is just that good
recommended
damn frikin shtty citystates are all like oh you better give us money or well end this friendship dude wtf you started the friendship jeeze but good game just kill citystates as soon as you see them
recommended
this game is great ive never played the previous civ games so this game was quite intimidating there is so much data presented it is hard to figure out which is important and which isnt it will take you some time to learn how to have fun with this game as the pacing seems glacially slow when you dont know what you are doing by the time youve beaten a few games youll be having a great time playing i love playing each new scenario and learning mechanics i didnt understand before it makes me excited to play the next game to try out a new strategy touch support on this game is really great too
recommended
played tutorial for 2 hours then realized i couldnt save then started a normal match and played for 17 hours 1010
recommended
such a fun game if you dont have it you should buy it d
recommended
got trapped on an island and got nuked by ghandi 910
recommended
civilization v is a beautiful game capturing the struggles of a leader trying to create a dominant empire to rise above the others somehow it manages to be both simple and complex it is mostly realistic and offers some humorous irony and increased difficulty in the form of ghandi however its dlc are way overpriced for the amount of content they actually offer and it gets boring after the first few playthroughs overall it is an amazing game that will keep you invested for hours on end keeping you on your toes until the last turn [9510]
recommended
this game is the best
recommended
create nice empire try to win by culture get invaded pwn the enemy ask for peace they want all my cities  you dont they denounce me 1010
recommended
super fun game one of those games you spend all night playing 
recommended
this is the first game i tried in the civilizations series and it definately will not be the last having purchased the original and gods & kings dlc nearly a year ago i will soon be purchasing the brave new world expansion whenever i find the time even if you are new to civilizations as a whole this game is still easily adaptable and well worth your time civilization v is simple enough to learn in a quick game or two however offers enough micromanageable options in order to be completely customizable both pregame and ingame this game caters to any play style and you can adjust nearly anything you want from game speed map size and map type to what resource focus to put your capital on and where to build a city to benefit you the most the game offers nearly endless amounts of customization and micromanagement i strongly suggest the purchase of the gods & kings expansion andor the brave new world expansion along with this game they add much more features to make your civ 5 experience as enjoyable as possible lastly you do not require any special talent in reaction time and you do not require an eagles eye to play all you need is strategy a sense of fun and time lots of time
recommended
i lost my life to this game
recommended
one of my favorite game get it if you have the money but be carefull if you start playing this game there is a good chance you will forget ti stop and then all of a sudden its 11 hours later
recommended
played civ series since the first in the series especially civ2 civ v is very addictive  only play if you dont want a life
recommended
>am washington >build monarchy >democratic england attacks >still win the battle for independence >all hail king washington
recommended
highly addictive game that makes you want to keep on playing
recommended
a game surprisingly more tactical and militaristic than a civilization should probably be especially with nukehappy gandhi still a fantastic game would recommend
recommended
best civilization game i have ever played very very addicting and above all really fun
recommended
peaceful ghandi of india he declared global thermonuclear war on everyone 1010
recommended
just cant get enough 
recommended
probably my favorite game of all time and has great replayability i love the strategy involed as well as the different ways you can win the game i highly recommend
recommended
its hard to go wrong with civ but now 2 expansions in the game has really come into its own
recommended
the best time suck you can buy many hours have vanished while playing this game
recommended
bought it on sale a few years back and wasnt able to play it due to poop computer i have sense bought a new computer and i can say i will flunk out of my classes next semester because of this game
recommended
this is a real time strategy on such a scale i cant even beging to compliment it the graphics are simply amazing wonders are well detailed the histoical information in the civilopedia is great for light reading and the thought put into the units was wonderful i mean how many people knew about turtle ships and galeasses before playing this game also the sense of reality in the diplomatic relationships between civs is relativly realistic it is a challenging game but not impossible i like the five ways to achive victory as well overall 1010 stars and i cant wait to see how their latest game civiliation beyond earth turns out
recommended
a great game well worth its price after over 420 hours the game continues to offer great experiences both in single and multiplayer it truly is the best strategy game being offered today and well worth your money ps buy all of the expansionsg&k and bnw for a better experience
recommended
i try making peace of india but he nuke me why is india do this i suppose to be peace please fix but otherwise good gaming india make me cry at night because many nukes into capital and make me die one time i contimplating suicide because india nuke too much and when i vote to be ally they nuke me because i no make city of mine to them very good game though 1110 will get nuked by india again
recommended
dont play this late at night or you will be up until 5 am trust me
recommended
an immense amount of replayability any strategy fan will love this game and history buffs will most likely be interested the only thing that may deter people is the learning curve which there is a mild one i havent played any previous civilization games and it took maybe an hour at most outside of the tutorial to understand the deepest levels of the game that is not to say it is simple by any measure however the tutorial walks you through the game and there is even a setting to change your familiarity with the game and even new expansions while you are playing outside of the tutorial in a normal game this mechanic will be sure to easily introduce you to new game systems through a typical playthrough i purchased this and most dlc and expansions at full price and it is completely worth it any discount on this game and the rest of the content is definitely a mustbuy amazingly addicting gameplay and a unique and enthralling storyline that is written with every new game that is played one can never be bored with a game that has a dynamic workshop supported by creative community members
recommended
this game is my life for at least 10 hours at a time
recommended
justonemoreturn
recommended
the vanilla civ v is definitely still a great game but really only shines with the big dlc bnw and g&k the dlcs give civ v the replayability you look for in a civ game so if you can snag the whole bundle in a steam sale theres probably one of the best purchaes on steam you could make
recommended
i single handedly wiped out the americans and my iroquois brothers as the shoshone who in historical times never numbered much over 4500 1010 would exact revenge again
recommended
day 1 as kamehameha polynesian ive nuked babilon with my bombers totally worth it warning this game is a hell of a drug play responsibly
recommended
probably my favorite game ever
recommended
great game
recommended
its hard to describe what is civilization to someone who never played it well its a simulator of building your own empire in a way that ou prefer  wars economics diplomacy religion if you are a big fan of strategy genre you should definetely play this game its great its also turnbased dont rush into multiplayer try some single player scenarios first to feel game pace and choices that you must do in order to conquer the world good luck
recommended
its a awsome game i played civ iii when i still was a young boy and i didnt knew how to play the game a while ago i bought civ v because is saw some awesome vids on youtube about it its pretty easy to learn the basics
recommended
played this game so much it destroyed my friendships now i can play without being bothered 1010
recommended
its ok
recommended
love this game its where you get to form your own empire and go from the stone age to the space age with so many world leaders and figures like george washington ghandi bismarck and many more so many different possibilities its just a wonderful game
recommended
11 hour game of domination to conquer the world ended up losing a 1v1 against gandhi because he had an army of giant death robots 1110
recommended
an improvement over previous civ games and twice as addictive
recommended
great turn based strategy very addictive with a lot of depth a lot of replay value
recommended
just one more turn you yell at 3 am after playing for 5 hours straight on the same game
recommended
at first civ v was pretty rocky there were a lot of problems with the initial release in terms of game balance and fun however i remembered full well the release of the original civ iii and civ iv games and the same was true for their vanilla versions both were made immensely moreplayable by their subsequent expansions the same is true for civ v with patches and expansions it has grown into an addictive gaming experience worthy of the civilization franchise almost all of the new game mechanics are winners from hexagonal tiles to social policies to the culture system almost i say the big huge massive flaw of this game is irrepairable and that is the 1 unit per tile restriction while ive no problem with implementing some sort of restrictions to limit stacks of doom and massive unit spam the 1upt system is ultimately the wrong way to do it turning 1000mile stretches of the map into tactical battlefields might be fun for the panzer general crowd but it slows the game down and leads to unpleasant unit shuffling it also doesnt make much sense that bronze age archers can fling arrows over hundreds of miles of terrain if you want a tactical battle system in civ then adopt the imperialism mechanic of switching to turnbased battles on localized battlefield maps instead of having them on the main map forcing players to move countless units around the map just makes multiplayer tedious as you wait for your opponents to move and move and move but honestly even with 1upt civ v is excellent it has grown to supplant civ iv as my strategy game of choice these days which is saying something
recommended
i think i may have just found a game to replace tf2
recommended
this game is the game that will make you late to work if you play it right now im still getting used to it will update review later but right now 100% worth getting it
recommended
i am reviewing this game you should purchase this game should you possess the required funds
recommended
one of the biggest time sinks ive ever had the fortunemisfortune of meeting sid meiers civilization v is a symphony of strategic awesome as you go up against some great names in history and establish your people this game is great vanilla but you enter a whole other level of awesome with the gods and kings and brave new world expansions history buffs strategy fans and just gamers in general will treasure this game
recommended
lets you live out your inner political critic who says i could do that better which in the end usually means rush nukes then drop said nuke on that nation who took that resouce you wanted 2000 years ago as far as the 4x genre goes i cant see a better game on the market although the brave new world expansion is essential i also recommend you check out the massive collection of mods availble from the ingame menu which let you play the game however you want summary buy this game with the brave new world expansion ps ghandi is a pk
recommended
best turn based strategy game ive ever played has great game customization with different map types and other preferences and options definitely recomend for a game alone or with friends

turn based strategy bug free overall 4 out of 5 complexity 4 graphics 3 immersive 5 inovative 2 game pace 2 this is a classical civilization game pro  its a great game bringing along allot of good suff they come out in the last 20 year against  sid meyer seam to have adhered to the hook them with the packs strategy giving a very dull game followed by a package with the good stuff from the past and then another package with the new good stuff just keep in mind that you need to complete version and youll have a very good game if you like the gender
recommended
great when on 75% off

recommended
one of the most entertaining games ive played in a while
recommended
sweet game definatly worth the money
recommended
brilliant as always from sid
recommended
worse than drugs do not play if you value real life
recommended
one word awesome even though it is very fun it can be quite daunting when you firs turn it on i really reccomend playing the tutorials or going on youtube and finding a good tutorial for begginers once you get the hang of it it becomes very addictive to build new cities or try to research your next weapon to 1 up your enemies also to me it seems the game has plenty of replay value while my play time compared to others is small i still havent gotten bored keep in mind this isnt fan bias i havent played a single civilization game until now better yet a strategy game although there are some downfalls the ai can be really annoying to deal with in example you can have their entire capital surround with superior military units  tanks artillery etc and they will say something along the lines of are you ready to surrender yet even on the lower difficulties another thing is a country you have good relations with will not want to declare war on someone even if the country you want to declare war on has captured one of their cities finally i have experienced some annoying glitches for instance an enemy city would get stuck in and infinite attack loop when attacking one of my units and eventually the game decided the way to end the glitch was to kill my units when clearly the could have survived the attack also when i built the great wall it simply dissapeared overall the game is a great experience if you like strategy games try this and if you dont still give it a try quick tip if you are on windows 8 dont select windows 8 & touchscreen mode when i launch the game it caused constant crashes for me instead chose direct x 10 & 11 mode
recommended
are you inteligent no  dont buy this game l yes l l l do you have a lot of time no  dont buy this game l yes l l l buy this game
recommended
one of my favorite games of all time seriouslyjust buy all of the dlc because you will want it anyway
recommended

recommended
this game gives me a massive history boner
recommended
this game started off great and with the exapnsions and dlc it has only gotten better it requires a good chunk of time to get the full experience so if you plan on doing a playthrough in one sit down expect o be up until the wee hours of the next morning this games has taken everything about strategy games thrown it together and amplified it i love the way the game is and i cant wait to see how it grows if you like strategy or are interested in testing the waters of the stratedy genre jump right into this game
recommended
really great game lots of different things to do so it never gets boring play through the whole demo before rating the game

an excellent turnbased rts that can be picked up very easily by those not so familiar with the genre or experienced players as stated in many other reviews youll find yourself playing this game for tens of hours without even realizing it its that addicting
recommended
about to reach 400 hours in this game i guess you could say its okay
recommended
its a great beginner strategy game
recommended
ill get those pearls for you sidon
recommended

recommended
this is a great strategy game even more so with the expansions impressive and well structured this is a must try for anyone who calls himself a gamer and for anyone just anyone beautiful game full stop
recommended
i had played this game when it first came out and hated it now with the expansions and patches it is honestly the best civ game i have ever played
recommended
addictive doesnt begin to describe this game it is one of the best ways to waste your time i highly recommend this game to anyone of course you absolutely need the brave new worlds expansion even if you dont buy the gods and kings expansion
recommended
good graphics good gameplay just what i like
recommended
just one more turn should be the motto for this game
recommended
awesome game that can be played over and over again
recommended
very fun game but it lags alot and often and will crash a bit
recommended
the civ 5 base game isnt a complete game u need the complete game with the 2 big expansion gods and kings and brave new world and now u got a rly amazing game the best turn strategic game when u start to play it u cant stop u think u need another 5 min at 2 am for complete something but at 5 am u are already in game this big game all this series anyway is amazing is a risk for your true life  for my thing anyway dont go look for multiplayer wth a lot players because the game come be rly slowly play it with 1 your big friend vs pc and u have a rly big fun
recommended
cool
recommended
love the versatility and unique play styles of each leader and love the ability to play with my friends online and the drop in drop out is wonderful
recommended
i strongly recommend this game for avid strategists your objective is to nurture a civilisation and become victorious over all others there are numerous victory possibilities thanks to a large range of ingame concepts from tourism to science each civilisation has its unique unitsbuildings as well as an ability through their leader moreover the dedicated mod workshop enhances the game further still bestowing upon it astronomical replay value give it a try you wont regret it 
recommended
ever wanted to completely pillage sweden or make every tile in tellus full of giant robots this is your change to do so

because chinas icon is a mothering dragon
recommended
i ing love this game ive had it for 2 months it runs on any computer
recommended
its fun to playperiod
recommended
i am completely addicted to this game would recommend to anyone that enjoys strategy games
recommended
awesome game not for those who dont like slower strategy games but great nonetheless
recommended
a huge improvement over civ iv especially when you take the expansions into account civ v offers a deep experience and addicting gameplay
recommended
i was able to eat a couple apples rate 1010
recommended
civilization 5 is a game you can play over and over again there are so many unique scenarios challenges and aspects to the game that every play through forces you to encounter something new i love the complexity of this game the depth of its balance even if the ai is quircky and the suspense that multiplayer offers
recommended
solid expansive diverse and funny at times game with a great community and extremely diverse and awesome mods
recommended
just buy it so we can all nuke each other and have fun
recommended
buy this game just do it it may ruin your life and cause you to lose all sense of the passage of time but its worth it also watch out for gandhi
recommended
turns take horribly long to end but otherwise a very fun game nobunaga4lyfe
recommended
spending my days playing this game super addictive
recommended
this game is really interesting to play with friends but playing singleplayer gets boring
recommended
im reviewing this for the community badge but good game anyway
recommended
like skyrim with hexagons
recommended
yes people this is absolutely the best turnbased strategy game to find it is super detailed within every unit of every civilization itself all the buildings and everything what comes with it somehow like a boardgame but also very different civilization v  best played with gods & kings and the brave new world dlc  is just the best strategy turnbased game on the market and its worth your money for sure you start out with a settler  to create a capital city  and a warrior and its up to you how you are going to expand your empire and how you are going to victory on the map you can play with really alot of civilizations from europe to america to asia its so cultural and big it contains houndreds of hours of gameplay without getting bored  atleast if you are into long turnbased matches  the game itself costs 30eu the gold upgrade costs 10eu and the newest dlc brave new world  requires the main game to be installed  costs currently 30eu but dont worry its worth your money for real
recommended
an absolute must for strategy nuts highly realistic with the technology tree barbarians can be quite annoying but then again so can most things in many games i highly recommend this game to new comers in the civ franchise and the veterans who are yet to play this
recommended
honestly one of the greatest games ive ever played far too much of my time has been spent on this masterpiece
recommended
havent played civ since the original and i must say that playing civ v was a real pleasure if you like the idea and good old civ youll like this its neither frustrating nor complicated its just fun
recommended
much wow very civ
recommended
excellent and vastly time consuming great game by itself but really starts to come into its stride with the brave new world expansion pack love it
recommended
this game is just pure fun i just picked it up during the steam summer sale and i think it was a great decision fun to play easy to learn and unique as well all you gotta do is add to cart and begin having a ton of fun
recommended
one of the best turnbased strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player this is one game that any strategy enthusiast or hell anyone stratcurious should check out
recommended
one of the most addictive games ive ever played always wanting to go one more turn a new game every time you play 1010
recommended
washington washington sixfooteight weighs a ing ton opponents beware opponents beware hes coming hes coming hes coming let me lay it on the line he had two on the vine i mean two sets of testicles so divine
recommended
if your a total  tard like me you wont understand the game untill you lose a round but its still fun
recommended
probably the best game i own when it comes to quality gameplay has been refined due to its age as a series and its graphics are still very good not to mention the ost music
recommended
oh why didnt i read the reviews it was 9pm and then it was 1am gg sleep
recommended
i just got this game and im loveing it already
recommended
i dominated the world because all other countries bought jeans and listened to music from my country some dude refused to stop spying on me even though i had four atom bombs stationed near his capital 1110
recommended
great game which robbed me dozens of hours sleep
recommended
ther r building n persons they kill enemy much fun and friends
recommended
if you had a very very good board game that you loved to play all the time and it was made into a video game civ v would be a lot like that highly recommended strategy game with plenty of depth and difficulty pretty addicting though
recommended
built the great wall of mongolia the eiffel tower of new york nuked chicago and went from being besties with bismarck to wanting his head on a plaque hanging on my wall all in one game oh and all that scientific research being done on the possibility of time travel just play this game youll jump forward pretty quick 1010 would nuke chicago again
recommended
i once injected 2 marijuans and this is more addictive than that
recommended
buy this game and give it a chance a couple of hours in and you will be addicted when youve reached the addictedstage it can last for hundreds and hundreds of hours when the addiction slowly disappears the game will still continue to give you a fair amount of entartainment for the years to come
recommended
me oh man i had better get to sleep i have so much to do tomorrow civ v whoa whoa whoa how about just 1 more turn 4 hours later me @$
recommended
most addictive game ever set an alarm clock to remind you to go to bed or you will see the sun rise before the game is over
recommended
it is a game
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
be me gamer with friends all buy civ v during holiday sale because 10foreverythingtif play it twice in the course of a month one friend plays it quite a bit and gets fairly decent host a lan friends come over boot up civexe attempt to recreate all the actions from world war ii something goes awfully wrong when germany steals nuclear fission from the us mfw in a matter of 6 turns the world is annihilated and the fuhrer stands tall and dominant 1010
recommended
nice win the world

recommended
hours of fun and diffrent ways to play one of the best games out

recommended
1010 would blow ghandhi up again
recommended
great game the best game i have played on steam so far get it
recommended
get stoned create a civ and get lost
recommended
this game is very much worth the money its quite fun to play with friends or even with total starngers
recommended
pros i love it i played it a ton and i love it i love how you get to chose your path and interact with others cons i sometimes find it hard to finish the game not like difficulty but continuing the game because it gets a little boring in the later eras i love future and modern warfare so i dont know why i dont like to finish time these games take forever i was playing and i was less than halfway through the game and it had already taken 300 turns and over 5 hours selection your selection of units and civilizations is very limited in my mind if it were me i would have over 200 different civs and as many unique units for every civ as possible this is close to impossible but that is just me overall i love it and highly recommend it
recommended
dont ever play this  vanilla thats a mistake boy get the expansions both if you can but at least gods and kings now lets build an empire  your workers were stolen by barbarians go find their bandit campm all right there it is lets get our worker back yeah warriors and archers all up on that camp get rekt bandit nerds hahaha yeah now we can finally improve some tiles and maybe build that great library you wanted the great library has been built in a far away land
recommended
i didnt know if i would like civ or not since ive never played a turnbased game i am addicted buy this game
recommended
1010 would raze w giant death robots again
recommended
this game is a must own for anyone who plays pc gaming
recommended
middle east is united under the great harun alrasheed france is underdeveloped country and englend spreads hinduism like a wild fire  what more do you want 
recommended
this is a really fun game i love it keep up the good work
recommended
addicting time consuming immersive these are words you hear when you describe the civ franchise and this is no different while rough at launch many updates expansion packs and dlcs have made it a formidable game in the civ franchise it still excels at allowing you to create your own stories and keep you playing just one more turn i recomend buying the expansion packs as they add many new civs and mechanics that add much needed depth that vanilla is missing the rest of the various dlcs are optional however buy this game you wont regret it but your todo list might
recommended
a truly fantastic game rich in depth and replay value if you get anywhere near finishing the steam achievements your a better person than i
recommended
amazing game spent a ton of time on it one of my most played game as well p the expansions are very worth it adds a lot of extra depth to a game that is already extremely deep
recommended
its simply amazing
recommended
this game is everything perfect in gaming i tend to be a massive critic when it comes to video games especially so to strategy games as it is my favored genre and therefore i am extremely picky about which ones i enjoy now one look at my steam library will probably tell you exactly what style of strategy games i enjoy rts simply put i have never really liked turn based combat in any form i can appreciate things like xcom and get the appeal to pokemon and final fantasy but i really just dont like turn based combat in any form this game however has altered my oppinion of turn based strategy completely i wish there was more to say but there are just so few words to describe this game well enough the soundtrack is excellent the gameplay is truly addictive and has depth the size of the marianna trench the level designs are randomized in most cases meaning that youll literally never replay the same campaign ever unless you play one of the presets the ai can be randomized as well throw all this into one bowl add in rpglike elements to build an empire thats truly yours a political and economic system that puts eve online to shame and a simple sleek beautiful easy to understand ui that feels like butter on your eyesockets and you still wont be able to grasp the perfection of this game for those of you blessed to live near an innout burger imagine youve just been told that you can now have free infinite innout burgers and fries for life the feeling of your taste buds erupting at the thought of all that burgery goodness is the equivelant of playing this game for ten minutes in summary stop reading and buy this game you filthy peasant and dont trust ghandi
recommended
basically you get to reright history so you can be gandhi the great warmonger or atilla the fun or even have the great wall of america who knows the rome could even go to space and its good and you should play it cuz its good yaay
recommended
its extremely fun and a great way to pass time its even more fun with friends
recommended
so much of my life has been lost to this game 1010
recommended
just as addictive or more so as civ iii the first game i ever spent entire weekends playing i am a terribad civ player yet get a lot of fun playing it every time
recommended
its like skyrim with gandhi 1010
recommended
the demo is great and worth it the full game however wont start so take that anyway you want it
recommended
civ 4s friendlier cleaner and more accessible little brother  still as addictive and damn good fun as well as being robust in a managerial sense but theres an air of compromise that long time fans will pick up on
recommended
i have never been a fan of turn based games but this one is too good to ignore i love building offensively as well as defensively and finding new ways to out wit my opponents great game
recommended
i love this game it is the best strat game in my opinion
recommended
i have found this is be a fun strategy game i would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who likes playing turn based based and taking over the world
recommended
really awesome game youll probably spend hours playing it ps nuke everyone
recommended
countless hours played currently countless to be played love it

recommended
its some kinky hardcore
recommended
favorite strategy after heroes of might and magic 3 and 5 i advise everyone
recommended
very interesting game
recommended
i avoided the civ series for years only recently picking up civ v as part of a humble bundle wow what can i say about this game that hasnt been said countless times before tons of fun and crazily addictive i was right to fear it and if you value your free time you should too
recommended
worth buying
recommended
ever wanted to just get the day over with thats simple just start a civilization v game and your whole day disappears
recommended
fantastic game so addicting
recommended
this game is like monopoly there is only one guy that one guy whos hard to tackle gandi but when you are that one guy you win but serious this game is awesome only hogwarts is better
recommended
this is a horrible game you start playing and just cant stop i played the original many many years ago when it came on one 14mb floppy it was already a good game then where i wasted a lot of time on i bought this when it came available on steamos and look and behold the game is still as great as it ever was still wasting my time like i have nothing better to do man i hate this game for being so good and not letting me go whats more the game creators know this when you complete a game and win it leaves you an option of just one more turn  but it never is just one more turn is it as with any addictive drug you think you can quit but you cant buyers be warned
recommended
if you dont own this game then you need to own it i could literally play this for hours a day and forget that i was even alive you can play it with your friends get your  kicked by queen elizabeth she is a giant c u n ext t uesday because she has every ing ship ever made ever and likes to denounce me all the time because she is an ape jokes on her when i nuke her  to sid meiers basement or you could ignore my useless banter about england sorry england i like you in real life and just buy the game you can get the game and the dlc for $15 on amazon if youre lucky you want to stop playing this but just one more turn but when that next turn comes then here comes a ing barbarian ready to steal your units or pulling a ship up to your coastal city like its a ing drivethru so you are gonna pull a frigate out of that coastal citys  and send that barbarian ship to the bottom of the sea where it belongs
recommended
if you dont have much free time do not buy this game it will ruin your life it will be 3 am you desperately need to sleep and all youll think about is just one more turn this game is perfect its like merging chess with history absolutely amazing i was kidding by all means buy this
recommended
great game get the dlc for full value
recommended
easy to grasp while hard to master those words are a great description of civ and all of its great new features i havent played this game as much as i have wanted but its only because every time i start a new game i end up sitting on the pc for 8 or more hours straight more or less if youre willing to sacrifice your free time to a game then go for it its a brilliant game
recommended
great game but it will eat your life
recommended
this game takes hours before you can finish the whole thing as one person there are more than one leader you can pick from this game is fun overall
recommended
good but better with the dlc
recommended
all that you need to know about this game is that it is sid meiers civilization come on you dont need more incentive
recommended
its consistently one of the most played games on steam i like it everybody likes it
recommended
dont bum rush culture when you are about to get ed by the portugese inquisition
recommended
great game easy to get into and yet extremely deep its a game where youre going to have to take risks and rely on the fact that your enemy takes risks with great planning and organization and strategy needed
recommended
glad i finally listened to my friends and gave this one a try two thumbs up love it
recommended
best civ game out there i can play for hours
recommended
i love this game its fun this is my best game ever
recommended
games like this is the reason pc always was is and will be superior to console
recommended
a wonderful continuation of the civilisation saga  as i had previously only played civ ii on my parents ancient windows xp the complex animated graphics were a nice surprise as was the hexagonal map pattern which i found allowed for battles to be a lot more strategic than the more constricting chequerboard pattern of civ ii a very nice turn based game with sufficient blood and gore opportunities for the budding genghis khan while a more diplomaticallyminded player can mind their own borders and so attempt a cultural or scientific victory it has a variety of different winstrategies meaning that one play through just isnt enough an excellent game for anyone who likes turn based strategy games
recommended
crazy addictive just one more turn
recommended
this game
recommended
just won a space victory as the persians awesome game
recommended
dude this game is beast
recommended
civilization 5 is an awesome game it is very addicting i ended up playing this game for 9 hours straight although i have to say that the brave new world dlc makes the game a lot more entertaining
recommended
when you play this game i think you should keep in mind that the game is not that great tbh if you play it you might like it if you like games but its only fun with dlc which is like one hundred dollars each way worse than train similate next time you want to play sind meisr civilization iv maybe just play it instead of buying this knockoff this game is just a rip off of the new sim city except you can t get the cars when you bea t it you will be thinking wow i dont know how to play this game  but itss okay i will train you i have beetan it twenty times on hardest difficulty with a steering wheel controler and no mods because im a purist when it comes to gameon hvae fun 010 gamfaqs because no way to steal enemy citys with the spy which is unrealistic
recommended
great game a little slow but worth the buy
recommended
great game especially with the dlc much easier to get into than other 4x games like crusader kings very addicting also good for hot seat coop
recommended
this game is possibly the best game ever it has very deep strategy and the opportunity to play very differently
recommended
why havent you bought this incredible game yet
recommended
omg stop i am bankrupt i wont be able to buy any more expansion packs
recommended
very good game and with the dlcs its even more fun for a great price so much fun and certainly with a sale
recommended
nice game worth it
recommended
literally cant stop playing ever
recommended
brilliant game wish i had brave new world though my only complaint is that the palace view that was in civ 3 is gone but i gtg and play more civ 5
recommended
the best of the civ series and with each new expansion it gets better and better 1010
recommended
for the person that wants to rewrite history from the comfort of their own home this is the game for you
recommended
what time is it again
recommended
awesome game the effort put into quitting for long enough to type this comment was overwhelming
recommended
for strategy games this one takes the cake and eats it too the modding community is strong with this one every game is different no two are alike multiplayer is nice and with final update smooth enjoyable experience all around if youre into building up a civilization from the ground up over the course of 6500 years making diplomatic decisions with other empires whilst protecting yourself from barbarians and finding ancient ruins all in the process this game is for ye

get ready to loose all other goals in life this game is surpsisingly addicting its a pretty easy to get the hang of too
recommended
its civ what do you expect
recommended
great game
recommended
best game ever  i could ruin my life with it
recommended
works flawless under arch linux civ 5 is per se a very good game the only thing i dislike about it is the sound track but theres an easy fix for that
recommended
one more turn then its bed time i swear this time
recommended
this is by far the greatest game i have ever played 1110
recommended
i havent left the room in 3 days 1010
recommended
are you a smart person do you like the notion of nuking the hell out of everyone then play civilization v probably the best rts game of all time with its stellar graphics and gameplay
recommended
civilization is a game that really takes time to learn its easy to learn the basics especially if you have played other strategy games before but the actual learning begins after that turn by turn everything that you do in the beginning and after that affects the endgame so you will have to know right at the beginning what to research or build and so on and its not like every game is based on same decisions because the game is constantly changing and there are multiple ways to achieve victory usually if you play at [b]normal[b] speed the games take >10h to play so i wouldnt recommend this game to those who like fastpaced action duh  civ v is a great way to waste your weekends playing games and not doing anything useful so if you like long term strategy games with plenty of challenge i think that this is your game ps i would recommend you buy the gods and kings & brave new world especially the bnw because those bring new elements to the game and bnw changes the game dramatically
recommended
in my opinion this is one of the best strategy games around the base game is pretty bland however the two expansion packs are what make civilization v as good as it is the expansions add new civilizations and great game mechanics like trade routes via boats and caravans tourism religion these can all impact the game in such a fantastic way and add a little more complexity to the gameplay i believe that civ v i best played with friends we love to pick random civilizations and set the ai to random personalities this makes the game pretty muchh different every time we play it gandhi may not be a  this time around washington might not just continue to expand all over your borders it is good fun especially when cooperating with one another about trading swapping resources and even war if you have the slightest interest in strategy games this is for you i do recommend both expansion packs though
recommended
dont play before going to bed youll end upnot going to bed for a good while
recommended
the great life destroyer that keeps improving with every xpac the game is a true successor to a legacy that started over 20 years ago dont be fooled by the date this came out its still a game with next to no equals in terms of the turn based strategy genre the learning curve might look steep at first glance but i assure you that mastering the basics game will come faster than you think for the over 1500 hours of gaming i have recorded in the game i am still someone who barely did any scenarios to keep the game fun dont forget to crank up the difficulty as the challenge that is brought by the highest difficulty levels will bring out the true test of your abilities
recommended
a great turnbased strategy game really fun when you get the hang off it
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is one of the best games i have ever played but i would recommend getting the brave new world expansion as it enhances the gameplay greatly i have literally spent hours playing with my friends losing every time but the experience of the game in itself is what makes this game truly remarkable a masterpiece
recommended
quite possibly the best turn based strategy game on the market
recommended
a turn based strategy game civilization v continues the classic civilization series
recommended
became friends with gandhi we made many trades and research agreements then he just ran over me with elephants and nuked my capital 1011
recommended
awesome game very addicting one of my favorite games
recommended
nuked gandhi and the whole world hated me 1110
recommended
a wonderful tbs for a group of players
recommended
great game although multiplayer can become a tad buggy
recommended
this is a great game and can lead to hours on hours of fun
recommended
1010 would bang
recommended
fine game i did not get so attached as i was once to civ 2 it is worth your money when there is a steam sale
recommended
great game but you need the expansions brave new world & gods and kings to bring some of the features from the previous title back in to the game civ iv was amazing and with a little bit of game time ive decided that this title is just as good
recommended
amazing game with tons and tons of fresh and entertaining content though the game is heavly heavly improved by dlc if your low on many brave new world is the for your interest with an active modding community and so much content for such a small price during steam sales its a great experience vanilla civ 5 7 out of 10 civ 5 with dlc 95 out of 10 {a must have for stradegy game fans}
recommended
fun game but my friends are  and never stick with a game 010
recommended
i havent showered in a month because of this game turned steam offline to avoid annoying conversations only slept 4 hours a night got a full caveman neckbeard got 32dcup man  only ate doritos and mountain dew for six months wore a fedora to protect my hair from too many oils called all female ais mlady to prevent wars watched anime with english subtitles between turns to understand the japanese civ better lost all friends fitness and family 1010 recommended

great game and very easy to lose track of time while playing started playing a game at 4 pm and ended up not stopping until 3 am causing me to fail a test and then having to stay after school 1010 would recommend

the only other civilisation i have played was back in the dos days you know civilisation or civexe this is game is exactly as i remember it from back then even the controls seems to be the same f fortify space skip turn etc im ecstatic my wife much less though i havent seen her much since i started playing

great game for anyone who likes strategy pretty addicting too overall great game

recommended
i have had a lot of fun with civ v there are many roads to victory you can also make a custom game to limit methods of victory there is so much that can be customized for each individual game you play very good replay value
recommended
great game with great replay value theres nothing quite like conquring the world as germany to spread judaism the dlc is definitely worthwhile
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
one of the best turn based strategy games ive played buy it
recommended
i keep coming back to it and it always sucks me in for hours
recommended
fun but longtermed plan a day to play the game
recommended
whenever i try to play it i end up playing it for way to long great game
recommended
i know for the moment that i only have around thirteen hours logged but that was one game where i needed just one more turn im too scared to go back 1010
recommended
ok im a bit biased i love almost all sid meier games so this one is a cake walk no campaign mode kind of takes away from it but with plenty to do its a fun game
recommended
one of the best strategy games i have ever encountered
recommended
a great strategy game civilization games have always gotten better every version
recommended
the days you dont have internet this game keeps you occuppied
recommended
there isnt any need to provide a reason
recommended
amazing game everyone should own this and all of the dlc

recommended
civ is a great turn based grand stratagy game
recommended
best game in the world <3 worth every penny d
recommended
i highly recommend civ to anyone who likes to build their own history a little its a game that shines when you invest yourself in it and explore the possibilities as any avid civ player can tell you you will truly form a symbiotic or perhaps parasitic relationship with your fellow players and ai all the while it being virtual and fictional and feel like history is really progressing inside your little realm as every player schemes their way forward that one settler takeover 200 turns earlier might be the reason why you decided to decimate someones civ or at the very least embargo them do you expand rapidly or keep it calm and small do you initiate combat with your neighbours or leave them as a safezone for potential invaders at the other end puppets and city razing science and faith everything is a factor in your ultimate victory or very untimely demise in short if you dont mind sinking hours into a virtual world and rant in frustration as your neighbour finishes your favorite wonder first a good casus beli for war if ive ever heard one then you shouldnt really be searching for anything else because you found exactly what youd want just a buttonpress away and probably a lot of cash
recommended
excellent great improvement on the original and new modes of combat and victory conditions make the game more strategic and diverse than ever before
recommended
one of the greatest strategy games ive ever played ive played this game for over 100 hours and can still play it
recommended
make sure you plan to get dlcs still playable without them but definately get them
recommended
it is a game
recommended
a great turn based strategy game tons of different civlilizations to play good depth and replaybility can customize to have games long or short with different maps supports multiplayer with frriends but i would recommend getting the brave new world expansion pack adds trade routes religion and much more overall my favorite strategy game out of all the ones i played get it
recommended
the best strategy game i have ever played hours of fun
recommended
its some kinky hardcore
recommended
erhmahgerhd i dont even know what this game is about yet so it begs the question why are you reading all of my reviews dont worry more comedic content is upcoming
recommended
id recommed this game its really nice but it chrashed 2 times while i was at turn 90 and it doesnt save the game 
recommended
this game is a fun game for people who likes strategical games
recommended
three thumbs up
recommended
great game so far played it for 80 hours all mods should be allowed for multiplayer though not just some mods
recommended
a fun and immersive game if you play it prepare to spend hours on it you will want to stop but what will really happen is you saying one more turn i swear then i am off
recommended

recommended
the gold standard of city building rts this game is visually beautiful and everytime i play it i discover a new strategy to give myself and edge combined with multiple ways to win it gives you endless replayability
recommended

recommended
i was only going to play on it for 30 mins but that turned into 10 hrs watch out for alexander hes really annoying
recommended
great strategy deep and fun but easy to pick up
recommended
i really like and had lots of fundom
recommended
this has got to be one the most immersive games ive played ive spent another 100 hours outside of steam playing civ 5 trying out a lot of civilisations and such but i still come back for more civ 5 like its predecessors civs 1 through 4 is a turnbased strategy game where anything can happen you can create and customise each and every town from any of the available civilisations with a variety of maps and playing fields you will never have the same area twice or the same set of enemiesalliesidiots you want to nuke unless you set them of course the 5 winning types bring a whole new look into how each civ has worked in the past such as spain with queen isabella who is great with natural wonders or japan who likes to reck military with the religious view of bushido then theres gandhi nobody likes gandhi seriously get out of my games 1010 would bang again
recommended
good game wasted my life kelly come back to me
recommended
its a good game the basic game aint much without exspanyions though
recommended
awesome game highly recommended
recommended
best strategy game ive ever played 910
recommended
addictive civilization building win the game before ghandi nukes everything and dominates you with rock and roll culture
recommended
if you wanna starve your people and have them  by barbarians this is your game 910
recommended
brilliant game worth the money could have easier controls but otherwise it is just awesome
recommended
very easy to pick up over 900010
recommended
beyond addicting
recommended
this game is a really good game you can play it in many hours without getting bored it is also a very good multiplayer game you have to use your stratistic mind to win the game wich i like so it is a really really good game 66 stars
recommended
vanilla game is good as it is even better with dlcs great community with hundreds of new mods everyday
recommended
bad game engine optimization bad ai tech tree is not as good as civ 4 spock has a better voice lazy patch work 2k bad civ personalities trend of removing game content for dlc for a extra overpriced amount like we dont know denouced by all for being peaceful not alpha centauri 2 good graphics good hud display raging barbies should always be checked fun multiplayer options good background music moddable if you can get the complete edition for cheap i recommend it at 5 or 10 $$$
recommended
a videogame boardgame that accurately pays homage to and makes fun of reallife cultures by quite nearly replicating some of the most believeable and unbelieveable events of human history cautionary for the impatient this game takes a long time to play
recommended
ghandi declared war on me 1010
recommended
1010 ruined my life
recommended
turn back while you still can
recommended
i looooove this game definitely get it youll get hours of play
recommended
i havent even finished a match i just keep restarting because i have a fetish for the opening moves 1010 fulfills my niche desires
recommended
i bever have prefered strategy games much but civ has drastically changed that it gives the aspect of struggle and fun at the same time because there is so much interaction that can happen with other countries as well as there being replayability
recommended
i just cant get enough of this game over the course of the game you will find yourself expanding plotting warring spying reasearching and backstabbing your nation to glory civilization v is extremely addicting and it will leave you staring at your screen for hours while you try to convince yourself that youll only play for one more turn seriously get this game ps gandhi is warmongering nukecrazy homicidal maniac watch your back
recommended
addicting
recommended
if you like strategy or board games i would highly recommend this to anyone
recommended
civ 5 is following the steady lineage of civ games brave new world  gods&kings packs are quite worth it due to adding a ton of new capabilities specialy in the brave new world the caravan tradings can make your day
recommended
i great strategy game that you chose the outcome of your civilization and others i would highly recommend this game to anybody who wants to play a strategy game
recommended
play as your favourite civilization through this grand strategy game endless fun its in the top 10 games for a reason 1010 make sure you have the latest expansions they are well worth it
recommended
as a huge fan of games like age of empires i figured that civ v wouldnt be much different i hadnt played any of the other civ games when i jumped into civ v and boy did i love it the game play is lots of fun and there is good level of strategy involved though the difficulty is easy to control when starting the game there are so many options and variety that its almost impossibly for me to get bored most fun is the ability to play with friends nothing says friendship like attacking with the full force of your military d
recommended
i have spent way too much time in this game and have survived the trial and error that was multiplayer it now works but put in place a pact to finish games you start and be cutthroat
recommended
amazing loads of fun
recommended
ive only played about 70 hours but its enought to tell me that this was one of the best buys i have ever made the civ 5 strategy may not be the most advanced or detailed but it is definitely exciting and easy enough to adjust to the many different legends who command their civilizations to greatness is also a perk each civilization has their own distinct advantage that can be used to help in whichever type of win you want the unitys are well balanced and the gameplay as said buy this game and all the dlc its a definite buy and if more dlc comes out i will be extremely interested in it 910
recommended
the best game of all time
recommended
i love all the civilization games i justi dont get why turns have to take forever the later into the game you go whyyyyy
recommended
this game is the
recommended
this game overall is very addicting and a fun game and i 100% recommend it the only thing i find dumb about it is the fact that if your civilizations borders are too close to another civilization they will eventually attack you no matter what other than that the game is pretty amazing
recommended
the god king of 4x games this takes everything great from civ 2 3 and 4 and puts them together fix nearly every complaint ive had about the series it has the elegance of 2 with improved graphics streamlined strategies more intelligent ai and maps and a multiplayer thats engrossed me for hundreds of hours so far if strategy is your thing this game is required
recommended
i have 800 hours played on this version of civilization and i have 50% of the achievements for it i love this game
recommended
great strategy game especialy if you have a friend to play coop with
recommended
ever wanted to change the corse of history nows your chance
recommended
as you can see i havent played much of the game yet as of june 14 however that gametime is for a 2day period this game gives interesting and complex gameplay to every player the ai is acutally able to be bargained with and is great at the games diplomacy for a change this game revolutionized the strategy genre at its release and the expansion does even better my verdict 1010
recommended
okay my first half of the review will be good stuff and other half bad stuff i love how many different leaders you can play as and there historicl units building and powers i also love the dlcs it adds yet more leaders although i think they spent slightly less time with the historicle info as there a few wrong dates and i do belive i misspelled word or 2 but stiil great the mechanics are slightly tricky at first but seem pretty simply after the tutorial i also love the difficulty you can set it so they wait to be killed or set it to murder you instantly  well on to the bad stuff the price is a bit high the workshop support could be better uhhh lets see ummm i got nuthin
recommended
a turnbased addictive fun and very strategical game an infinte learning cap and replayability a must have for anyone who loves rts games but without the stress of having to be very quick
recommended
very very fun but as a warning a small game took 10 hours to complete fun complex yet simple enough for those used to rts or tbs can catch on relatively quickly
recommended
it is epic
recommended
you can kill em with kindness culture or just kill em its all good
recommended
best by far strategy game ever created and best civilization game civilization iv is nothing compared to civilization v on average a game takes about 24 hours to complete on average time setting there are 8 difficulty levels 1 settler  8 diety warning diety is only for the most harcore gamers tons of achievments around 280 in total steam trading cards are avaliable for this game got nuked by ghandi even though it was made in 2010 dont let that discourage you from buying it quality game create friendships with other civiliztions or go to war with them remember there are several ways to win domination victory cultural victory science victory space race domination victory is the easiest way can you build a civilization that can stand the test of time 1010
recommended
yeah ill play one game2hours later 1110 great game
recommended
this is a very good game as it is a time consuming one but well worth the money has an amazing amount of replay value
recommended
probably one of the best games ive played the only bad things i can think of is the repetetiveness of a domination victory where most of the time your army is far superior to all others and you spend alot of the game shifting dozens of units around one by one 455
recommended
best strategy turn based game till this point of 2014
recommended
dont worry about it
recommended
after hundreds of hours of gameplay this is still my goto game when im looking for something to do cant recommend this game enough
recommended
great game in a great series
recommended
the game where you get the man into the space age wage war conduct diplomacy discover new technologies go headtohead with some of historys greatest leaders and build the most powerful empire the world has ever known great game
recommended
it is civ the ultimate turn based game get it
recommended
great game especially after some time and many game updates it feels very well rounded and cleverly designed of course the gameplay is mostly not new but there are a lot of new aspects and improvements to justify buying this one even if you already own the already brilliant civ iv especially the new strategic aspects from the nonability to stack units and hexagonal fields was a welcome change the only thing i dont like is a late period in every game session when everything seems to kind of drag along but i guess thats only because of the way i play slowly expand and tend to my cities and later build an army and conquer everything ^^ thats the part thats fun but drags along and gets old fast i have to admit i havent even ever played civ in multiplayer so i cant say anything about that 8510 ps i find the two addons pretty expensive but to be honest they dont add anything i find essential to enjoy the game nice stuff but not necessary at all for those who are thinking about buying the game but fear they wont have much fun without also buying all the expensive extra stuff
recommended
civilization 5 is a fantastic turnbased strategy game that keeps you playing for hours its addictive and a must have game
recommended
cant go through a whole game being friends with a single civilization
recommended
great strategy game in fact the best stragety game i have ever played which says a lot its not just strategy either its also fun to play online with your friends but i suggest that you might want to learn the ropes before you face a deitylevel cpu  btw this is my second favorite video game of all time
recommended
best strategy game ive played really fun with friends and still nice solo any civilization nukes lets play some civ
recommended
such a fun game brave new world and gods and kings definately made this game better than civ 4
recommended
gondi was being a total  so i stole that hoes nukes and nuked rome as china 100% acurate story 1010
recommended
the beginning and end of tbs amazing
recommended
i really like this game civilization v is a very great game tactics politics economy you will spend a lots of hours of your life with it
recommended
this game is for those who like staretegy games but want to have some more time to think what to do
recommended
great game but the games take ages so prepare for that
recommended
civ v is civ v buy it play it enjoy it
recommended
i never expected to be drawn to a civ game they never really appealed to me before however this game remains my most played on steam and i constantly keep telling myself just one more turn i recommend this to everyone
recommended
killed a hell of a lot of time had a great few laughs learned that ghandi is a prick 1010 would recommend
recommended
for those who love strategy games this game is for you i have played countless hours of this game theres alot you can play around with especially get the game with brave new world because it adds a lot more to the game
recommended
fantastic game there
recommended
i feel naught but gluttony when i descend into the depths of this game before me stands a vast planet ripe for the fruits of conquest my conquest thousands of years pass and my empire is never satiated despite the marvels of the world laying to waste in the empires glorious capital the citizens of this utopia cry and beg for more the great pyramids and ancient wonders go unattended as people demand for new marvels food is never of want yet they demand for more rivers run with gold yet they demand it to be filled with the blood of my enemies i plead for my empire to embrace the peace which ive fought milennia for watching a small band of settlers build a vast nation expanding multiple continents only to succumb to their bloodlust sickens me i digress every click of the mouse casts years ahead in this virtual heroin pit yet hours fly by as i slowly watch myself lose interest in the plights of real life yes i should relieve myself in a bathroom or shower or attend to the various pleas of my family to pick up the phone and let them know i still draw breath i cannot abandon my love though i press forward and embrace my citizens as they were my own kin i watch in horror as opposing civilizations who have lived side by side as allys trade partners research collaborators and friends turn to their own demands and launch vast assaults on my beloved people the only affirmation this game offers is the demonic plague which will steal your humanity and cast your selfish demons upon you
recommended
this is virtual heroin
recommended
i love this game best civ game out there updates just keep getting better somehow
recommended
this game will swallow hours of your time
recommended
excellent addictive gameso many scenarios and situations to build or conquer may pull some all nighters for some games my only complaints are the multiplayerits like running the game on the lowest settings and sometimes the ai is just plain stupid i highly reccomend this to anyone who likes strategy games
recommended
this game just look at the hours i have put into it and i still havnt touched all the civilizations playsyles or even the map settings single player multiplayer mods dlc this game does everything everyone says it does one small flaw i will note is the ai is very hipocrytically unforgiving attack a warmongering race and eliminate their capitol and it triggers a domino effect that gets the whole world declairing war on you attacked a city state at the start of the game and conqured it reached turn 300 still basically begging for forgivness from other civs reguardless of that the game plays flawwlessly for me is absolutlely beautiful and will keep you comming back for years to come even when you put it down youll want to pick it up again in a month or two just to see what this scenerio would imply to the world another 50 hrs and 7 games later
recommended
im going to start this review by saying note this is a great game its mechanics are great you overall should probably buy it but i also have to write this about a warning this game is very fun and when you play you feel as if you should continue playing and not stop playing so what im trying to say is this game is extremely addictive you will spend hours on end wasting your time on this video game no breaks you dont stop until you finished playing that civilization luckily i was able to get out eventually but if you can get addicted and dangerously addicted to games easily i dont recommend this game to you but if we delve into the game mechanics its pretty good the game is a bit to laggy but very great idea once you go through the tutorial thats easy to follow you will get the hang of everything and can easily lead your civilization to becoming the greatest kindom ever the price for what it offers is definitley good but not amazing overall im going to give this game an 810 so you should buy this game but beware my friends beware
recommended
great game i have never played an rts before but couldnt resist civ 5 there are so many countries ways to win etc i enjoy the fact that i can play against 24 countries in a world sized maps i can play the political game or i can become a warmonger and take the world by force easy for people who have never played rts and yet still has enough content to please long time rtsers as well
recommended
a thousand times better than civ iv
recommended
good but better with the dlc
recommended
all that you need to know about this game is that it is sid meiers civilization come on you dont need more incentive
recommended
its consistently one of the most played games on steam i like it everybody likes it
recommended
dont bum rush culture when you are about to get ed by the portugese inquisition
recommended
play it all the time great game for people looking for a strategy turn based game i strongly recommend it to people looking for a game that you can just start and play over a few days great replay value and overall i feel it was a great purchase
recommended
just give up on trying to go outside because this is the end
recommended
one more turn just one more turn 6 hours later and ive got an hour till i have to go to work time enough for one more turn
recommended
this is definitely one of the greatest games ive ever played i wouldnt reccomend getting the vanilla version though with gnk expansion its very good but really starts to shine when you add brave new world watch out though its really addicting and a single game can take up to like 10h but if you can spare this game some time you definitely wont be dissapointed
recommended
civilization v the fifth installment in the amazing civilization series is undoubtably one of the most userfriendly easytoplay strategy games on the market players that are new to civilization will find this game enjoyable the second they start to play as the game has a very small learning curve and is easy to grasp if youre an older player youll find the game harder to get into than previous installments and the base game is lacking many of the things that made previous civilization games enjoyable religion behindthescenes politics advanced diplomacy vassal states etc leonard nemoy and a large number of civilizations however with gods & kings and especially brave new world the game becomes what it should have been advanced full of new ideas and addicting as hell g&k readds religion and bnw adds in some nice diplomatic options and advanced trading abilities all in all civilization v is great for new civilization players and perfectly fine for old players and great for old players if they have the two main addons either way youll find hours of daytime vanish into thin air
recommended
you can do like so many thingss
recommended
you will be addicted to this game forever
recommended
always fear the silent ones
recommended
love the game it never really gets boring because you can switch civis every game i like how the ais are really smart you do not have to buy the dlc for it to be fun
recommended
awesome just one more turn  the expansions are very good and make the game even more exciting
recommended
i love this series played civ iii
recommended
beware of gandi
recommended
ok listen this game is so great i dont care if you like strategy games or not this game is 100% worth it the only problem i have notived is that its little bit on the high end pc side of things but that doesnt mean its not playable with a bad computer because there is a thing called strategic mode which turns the game into a board game if love creating an empire and watching it rule the world or fall to its doom this game is for you
recommended
beautiful example of what the gaming medium is capable of the vanilla version is remarkably welldesigned and compelling the two expansions add depth and strategy so seamlessly that i often cant remember which features were added in expansions  they all seem like indispensible parts of the game
recommended
a game to soak in yours hours into with a good singelplayer and a good way to pass time ^^ to many of my hours have been sucked into this game but i do recomend you to get brave new world first u dont need the once before those but bnw is a game changer d
recommended
scouts walk by my boarder im taking that as a direct act of war 1010 would recommend
recommended
if your looking to find your first strategy game you can do no better than civ v i grew up playing the third game in the franchise and despite the game having many flaws and being incredibly hard i enjoyed the game immensely civ v changed and perfected things beyond what fans of the series thought possible from getting rid of the unit stacking minimizing city micromanagement to changing the movement from squares to hexagons so much could have gone wrong and instead created a modern masterpiece any and all bugs or imbalance issues were fixed in the updates or dlcs ive played 200 hours and still going wait for a steam sale and nab a genuine copy of the bestselling build your your own empire simulator oh and it has multiplayer and community mods 55 stars
recommended
this game is seriously awesome that being said i wouldnt recommend playing it if you ever plan on doing anything ever again in your life because it is super addictive
recommended
fantastic rts just buy it on a sale
recommended
this game is fun but its more addicting then fun it makes you keep playing even when you just want to put a fist through the monitor
recommended
gimme back my life 
recommended
yes game addicting and fun frusterating sometimes but good i like being washington
recommended
amazing if you love strategy games its fun to play with friends because singleplayer can get boring after a while
recommended
great for people who arent big in stratagy not hard to learn and go crazy for power as you conqure the land and destroy all thats in your way or just be cultral and win that way or even yet be into technology and be the first to the moon to win the game the best thing is it takes time to beat it so you dont have to replay every hr it take hours just to beat the game half way its great
recommended
totally not another ghandi nuked my  review ghandi totally nuked my  its ok i brought him the freedom he wanted as ol georgie boy
recommended
i love this game if you have a life you might want to discard it now
recommended
highly addictive the just one more turn and ill go to bed mentality has kept me up late to many times playing this game
recommended
dont worry about it
recommended
i love this game i grew up playing age of empires and age of mythology so this was great to find
recommended
sid meiers civilization v the only game that i can play for straight 12 hours just one more turn
recommended
great game really buliding on civ iv
recommended
this gamethis game its like nutella seems kiddy on the outside but the goodness damn epic ive never actually attracted to strategy games frankly i was the kind of guy that was all about pew pewpew pew games but damn this game is easy and enjoyable ive heard that the older civilization games are harder than this but this games is like an opening to anyone who wanted to try or know what a strategy game is like now excuse me nuking gandhi back
recommended
lots of land to explore lots of different civilizations to play and ways to improve your growing kingdom this game does take a bit of time to play but it is rewarding for all the hours you put into it this was the first civilization game i played and it taught me some things in history that i didnt know with all the content put into this game now including dlc brave new world and mods this game should keep you busy for quite a while
recommended
i have played lots of games but this is my love 
recommended
awesome game but can take a while with a lot of enemies p
recommended
great strategy game it may take a while to get into the multiplayer but if you have a group of friends it is excellent singleplayer is also entertaining
recommended
it is good
recommended
me gusta mucho
recommended
the biggest problem with civ 5 is that the game is borderline bland and boring without any of the incredible dlc though with all of thosewhich if you buy on a steam sale wont be to pricyput together you get a beautifully crafted turnbased trategy game that demands hundreds of hours to be put into and always lets the player find something new when they play it it also very easily teaches the player to play with difficulty levels going from very beginner to experienced master civilization 5 is a wonder of a game that demands attention
recommended
absolutly amazing strategysimulation game superb graphics great gameplay everything about this is phonominal that is if you like strategy games
recommended
this game ruins more friendships than monopoly which is by far its greatest feature 1010
recommended
this game is great for the first three hours shortly it nose dives into next turn next turn next turn next turn  with minimal production near the end you get that start of the game freedom but its crashed by how soon youll win the game this game goes from amazing to boring in turns just try different game modes and until you find the settings you want 8510 fast fun easily understood but hard insane replayablity goes from slow to fast quickly certain countries will hate you for no reason gandhi
recommended
i turned gandhi into a militaristic s that hoarded oranges and then i slaughtered everyone that was alive then my people started to rebel i left to take a  and i lost after i won best game ever 1010
recommended
one of the best tbs ever 3
recommended
great game with mods it makes it move fun to play with should get it
recommended
very challenging and a great play with a group of friends
recommended
great game recomend it to anyone of any age
recommended
my favorite game of all time
recommended
okay so i would call the people reading this review just another group of filthy ing ers which you ing are but valve doesnt like that anymore now lets get one thing straight right gere right now valve consists of nothing but cool guys gabe is our lord and savior and his disciples follow his teachings by the ing book however they have decided to censor swearing in the reviews so i guess either i have to cool it a little or you guys have to start figuring out what i mean by  so yall as better get real good at seeing the difference between hearts lets get started imagine that youre a citizen of the united states of america or the united kingdom or maybe even russia and you want to control your country as they kick  in world war ii additional feature if youre from russia you can also fabricate a false history in which russia doesnt ing suck from its creation until present day you get to control a country from start to finish doing as you please you can focus on science religion warfare or anything else you can take over other empires  churches and burning women you have a hugeeringloadbagofsandfestivitiesandgiant amount of control in this game and can rule how you please although civilization v sacrifices historical accuracy for the sake of a good gaming experience it does include some nods to the real empires of history such as civilizationexclusive units you can change the settings for a game or choose premade scenarios if you want more historically accurate gameplay and you can play through real events such as the fall of rome in conclusion although im not a fan of the strategy genre this games addictive gameplay endless replayability and vast array of features earn it a 910 in my book
recommended
too addictive you may lose your friends and family cuz of this masterpiece 
recommended
very good game a lot of fun takes a long time but still great would give this a 910
recommended
one of the best strategy games to play with you friends try to win trough military science or diplomatic viktory and some outhers as well
recommended
civilization v may not be the best game in the series but to say it isnt a truly great game would be a clear falsehood although lacking some of complexity and difficulty of its predecessors civilization v is a triumph for modern strategy games and city builders alike starting from the most ancient eras of human time on a randomly generated map with few user inputs you portrayed as one of the greatest leaders of history and your people will traverse through time technological innovation and cultural expansion working with or competing with you are your neighboring civilizations and newly added to the series citystates these ministates can be made to serve you or your competitors in a variety of ways the combat system of civ games has been entirely revamped in this edition no more stacks of doom and much less of the how did that medieval archer shoot down my jet fighter instead each unit occupies its own hex and the battle outcomes are not only more predictable but much more realistic this is made even better in the gods and kings expansion which revamps and balances the combat system even more so the single player game is one of absolute selfindulgence and glee you will trollop your foes on the lesser difficulties and construct massive and intimidatingly successful cities to crush your ai foes in whatever manner you see fit be it through diplomacy culture technology or perhaps just flat out war the game does indeed grow in challenge as you increase your difficulty but unfortunately due to the complexity of the game the developers were forced to sort of bandaid the higher difficulty settings in that rather than facing more devious opponents with advanced strategies you have simply been handicapped while your ai rivals have been given gifts of free technology and increased resources there are also a variety of special scenarios some downloadable which place you in a specific time period or conflict these can be quite a puzzle on the higher difficulties the real challenge in the game for those who dare to venture is in the online and lan multiplayer playing against real people adds a whole new level of difficulty but also opportunity competition can be fierce in some games luckily because of the nature of the game and the desire to play with real people instead of computers it shouldnt be difficult to find a group of nonwar like players for those still wanting to build their skills before truly experiencing pvp style play players drop frequently because of time constraints and games are rarely finished which is why it is lucky that there are special modes such as quick speed to allow more rapid progress with so much variety in selection of leaders maps strategies settings and more it is easy to see how players like me could clock hundreds of hours expansions downloadable civilizations almost always worth it if only so that you may battle against them or be better able to join more games it just adds more to the amazing international melting pot of war and conflict personally i find many of the dlc civs the most fun to play as extra scenarios these i maybe could do without but if you love history or are just starting out in civ they could be a great way to explore the game in addition they offer special civs with unique abilities and powers not possible in regular play gods and kings although i wont get into it too much youre crazy if you dont get this expansion it fixes so many issues and adds so much to the game namely religion real civ 5 starts with this expansion brave new world firaxis has done it again even more civilizations more bug fixes and more customization and realism i absolutely love this new expansion it is the reason i am playing again trade routes advanced diplomacy the world congress and more this polishes off the game and gives it the 5 stars it deserves ratings my rating for the game is at its current state not taking into account previous issues or ones that may occur in the future i figure my review has been written for people who are considering purchasing the game and so i have let go of any ill will caused by issues that are now resolved singleplayer 5 multiplayer 5 gameplay 5 replayability 5 100% reccomend to anyone who enjoys strategy games city builders history buffs or political science buffs
recommended
one of the best time machine games first impressions may seem a bit complex but once you learn how to play it you wont regret
recommended
one of the most addictive games ive ever played my first match i spended like 8 hours without even realising 910
recommended
i have a lot of fun playing this one the possibilities are endless i enjoy randomizing all settings so i can always have a new setup
recommended
a material i love this game the soundtrack and how relaxed it makes me i cant wait for civ 6 if it comes everybody should get this game bless sid meiers heart
recommended
reviewed with godskings expansion this game has sucked over 40 hours of my life in the last 2 weeks it brings the just one more turn addiction that i felt with civ 2 and alpha centauri as well as updated gameplay and strategy at first i didnt like the dumbed down tech tree but its grown on me i have few complaints about the gamethe automated city manager is adequate alliances with the ai seem hardly useful you hit endgame and they will backstab you or maybe thats just koreas mo in every game and it appears you can game the new combat system something fierce i field at most 37 units to defend my empire regardless of empire size i have to admit i really enjoy the fact that civ has finally gone hexagonal
recommended
love the graphics compared to civ iv and as always an awesome soundtrack xx
recommended
awesome game but far to many achievements this will take forever to collect most of them 
recommended
really good turn based strategy game

easy to play difficult to master the game i just cant stop going back to forjustonemoreturn having played all of the civilization games since my best mate introduced me to the orginal when we started high school through to being married with 2 kids i have definitely grown up with civ and it has grown up with me over the past 20 odd years i have spent 1000s of hours in the civ games over the years and have found each to be different to the game before it and all enjoyable although i much preferred alpha centauri to civ 2 all of the civ games are pretty easy to get in and play with a simple interface and varying difficulty options allowing anyone to play develop strategies and build their empire but underneath this is a game that is extremely challenging to master with the steam achievements helping to give differing objectives to work toward while playing the game i have found my gameplay more focused in this than previous civ games yet i still start random games just to play and keep enjoying the differing maps and starting locations generally i have been against dlc for games as it often feels that the vanilla releases are getting less content than in previous years but with civ i had already spent 200 hours in game before the outlay on the first expansion and have since bought the dlcs and expansions gods & kings and brave new world and have passed 500 very enjoyable hours the feature that has impressed me most with this civ release has been the scenarios which have been both challenging and enjoyable to complete most pc gamers would know the names sid meier and civilization and many would already have these names on their must buy lists but civ 5 is more than just a game of the year it is a game to go back to time and time againjustonemoreturn

sid meier`s civilization v is an exceptional game changes from the past games include the new social policy trees they are much like the civics in civ 4 but in a more enhanced way that goes more deeper they now have ranged units in the game that can fire up to three tiles away the square grid has also been replaced with an hexagon grid military units can not be stacked anymore but becasue of this you can do some really cool blockaed things now i won`t spoil anything more for you guys so i hope this review was helpful please check out my civ 5 guide on screenshots i recommend this game it`s by far my favorite turnbased strategy game thre is also toutorial on the basics of the game oh and cities can now attack themselves you do not need units in the city to protect it also there is no anarchy or revolts you also can not trade technologies anymore but they have added city states which are like small civs but they won`t try to win the game if you gain a good reputation with them they will gift you stuff or help you out to gain a good reputation with them you can either give them gifts of gold or units i hope this review was helpful and i hope you like the game to someday

do you have lots of friends that love eachother well this game is perfect for you it has a few side effects though 1 watch your friendships crumble to pieces in a matter of minutes 2discover that paranoid side of you that you never thought you had 3 greed that is all so enjoy hating your friends if you dont have friends welltry single player and get nuked by ghandi have fun

one more turn just one more turn 6 hours later and ive got an hour till i have to go to work time enough for one more turn

this is definitely one of the greatest games ive ever played i wouldnt reccomend getting the vanilla version though with gnk expansion its very good but really starts to shine when you add brave new world watch out though its really addicting and a single game can take up to like 10h but if you can spare this game some time you definitely wont be dissapointed
recommended
civilization v the fifth installment in the amazing civilization series is undoubtably one of the most userfriendly easytoplay strategy games on the market players that are new to civilization will find this game enjoyable the second they start to play as the game has a very small learning curve and is easy to grasp if youre an older player youll find the game harder to get into than previous installments and the base game is lacking many of the things that made previous civilization games enjoyable religion behindthescenes politics advanced diplomacy vassal states etc leonard nemoy and a large number of civilizations however with gods & kings and especially brave new world the game becomes what it should have been advanced full of new ideas and addicting as hell g&k readds religion and bnw adds in some nice diplomatic options and advanced trading abilities all in all civilization v is great for new civilization players and perfectly fine for old players and great for old players if they have the two main addons either way youll find hours of daytime vanish into thin air
recommended
you can do like so many thingss
recommended
you will be addicted to this game forever

always fear the silent ones

great for people who arent big in stratagy not hard to learn and go crazy for power as you conqure the land and destroy all thats in your way or just be cultral and win that way or even yet be into technology and be the first to the moon to win the game the best thing is it takes time to beat it so you dont have to replay every hr it take hours just to beat the game half way its great

i hope you have a lot of hours of sleep to spare civilization v is a very complex turnbased strategy game for newcomers its easy to understand and grasp the basics but under the surface there is a lot of room for planning decisions to make and strategies to use after youve learned the basics youll learn the other aspects of the game mostly by trial and error youll find out that making a lot of cities needs to be balanced with happiness and that it isnt a very good idea to settle on nothing but tundra this game isnt so much about being able to do a lot of actions in as little time as possible or very quick reflexes planning and strategic measures are much more effective than producing buildings on impulse diplomacy is a big factor when you start a match you dont necessarily think of ways to destroy your enemy there are multiple ways to victory sometimes its better to befriend your opponent to make deals that make your civilization stronger or assist eachother in times of need not to say warfare isnt an option taking down a city or a civilization requires a lot of strategy and planning youll have to keep in mind cities can be tough to take down if they have a lot of defensive structures or defensive units within borders and you cant simply walk over most cities with just a few cheap units its easier to be defensive than to be the attacker these and many more mechanics make civ 5 as interesting and entertaining as it is youll find yourself keep wanting to press next turn seeing what effect your moves made if your scout will get away or get trampled by those units on the other side of the forest et cetera the diplomacy gives a lot of options for mindgames betrayal and friendship surprising your ally who is about to take a cultural victory by launching an invasion assisted by a nuclear missile can be completely gamechanging if executed well i highly recommend this game to anyone remotely interested in this game its timeless
recommended
the game is really good i have spent about a good bit of time playing its not a total waste of money the game feels more like a simulator than strategy all the cpus can have different personalitys and actually have a think more even on easy the cpus are making good descisions the game also lets you choose a historical figure such as alexander the great washington ramses elizabeth and augustus caesar multiplaye is pretty good to with a special chat syste you not really need any voice speaking all the mechanics make the game intresting and fun i would say sid did a good job on this game my rating is 910 this game is one of the best i have seen
recommended
i originally got this for me and a friend to play together a few years back and to be totally honest the game is amazing i would of course at least reccomend playing the demo to see if youre into this kind of thing but civilization v is a very fun game and its great to play with your friends
recommended
this is a good game but it is a hole new game when you get brave new world gods & kings and other dlc
recommended
say goodbye to any of your social ambitions and prepare to abandon your family because you will be sitting on your  for 7 hours straight playing this game germany poland and ottomans ftw

aight listen up at first it may seem like a boring  game but thats because you havent played it yet my a listen as soon as you have a few warriors and builders up the game gets incredibly fun like you can  people and be like yo what it is  and divebomb entire ing cities bruh if you do have any power in real life  get civ 5 and rule entire nations bruh this game is better than watching shrek  on an onion and eating it as part of the shrekian ritual to worship our lord and savior shrek now thats saying something and even if you geet bored aand youre like i beat the game on every single difficulty with every leader now what theres a bunch of stuff you can download n stuff now go buy this game or if you already own it play it nuff said tldr  you read the whole thinng you lazy piece of

with a load of carefully placed content the game delivers a fulfilling experience of what its like to  and pillage every other culture on the entire earth as gandhi regardless of its wonkiness at times and high spec requirement for hosting late games with a lot of ai the multiplayer experience is enjoyable especially with a lot of friends
recommended
ever want to forget to eat and have the clock mysteriously turn from am to pm and back againplay this game the ultimate in convincing yourself just one more turn seriously its that good
recommended
this is a great introduction to strategy games really loved it when it first came out as it was really the first somewhat difficult strategy game i played however if you happen to be an amazing strategy game player i dont think this is the game for you get one of paradoxs grand strategies however for new players this is an amazing experience that really introduces you to the strategy game genre it gives you advice on how to play and is easy to get the hang of now its supposedly addicting but for me i kind of lost interest after a bit over 200 hours but thats all personal preference this is an amazing even classic that everyone should play
recommended
great game its fun to play by yourself or with a group of friends it takes a bit to get the hang of everything but once you get it it becomes even more fun
recommended
this game is too addicting im sitting at my computer at 1000 and im all like ust one more turn just one more turn pretty sure thats copyrighted p
recommended
this game is fantastic its so in depth and worth the time and money spent on it the only thing that you have to be careful of is playing too much of it as one game could last 30 hours my longest game so far
recommended
i felt that civlization v is simple yet complicated it is easy to get the hang of but complicated in the way that you need to deal with everything and pay attention to every little aspect in the game
recommended
this game made me racist 1010
recommended
one of the best turn by turn strategy games i have ever played and i am definetly not saying that just to finish the pillar of the community badge
recommended
i love this game i grew up playing age of empires and age of mythology so this was great to find
recommended
sid meiers civilization v the only game that i can play for straight 12 hours just one more turn
recommended
great game really buliding on civ iv
recommended
this gamethis game its like nutella seems kiddy on the outside but the goodness damn epic ive never actually attracted to strategy games frankly i was the kind of guy that was all about pew pewpew pew games but damn this game is easy and enjoyable ive heard that the older civilization games are harder than this but this games is like an opening to anyone who wanted to try or know what a strategy game is like now excuse me nuking gandhi back
recommended
lots of land to explore lots of different civilizations to play and ways to improve your growing kingdom this game does take a bit of time to play but it is rewarding for all the hours you put into it this was the first civilization game i played and it taught me some things in history that i didnt know with all the content put into this game now including dlc brave new world and mods this game should keep you busy for quite a while
recommended
i have played lots of games but this is my love 
recommended
awesome game but can take a while with a lot of enemies p
recommended
great strategy game it may take a while to get into the multiplayer but if you have a group of friends it is excellent singleplayer is also entertaining
recommended
it is good
recommended
me gusta mucho

the biggest problem with civ 5 is that the game is borderline bland and boring without any of the incredible dlc though with all of thosewhich if you buy on a steam sale wont be to pricyput together you get a beautifully crafted turnbased trategy game that demands hundreds of hours to be put into and always lets the player find something new when they play it it also very easily teaches the player to play with difficulty levels going from very beginner to experienced master civilization 5 is a wonder of a game that demands attention
recommended
absolutly amazing strategysimulation game superb graphics great gameplay everything about this is phonominal that is if you like strategy games
recommended
i enjoy playing this game because i like the idea of being able to develop technologies and advance through the eras i also enjoy attacking enemy units but find it annoying when i usually lose the battles even with the advantage overall i think that it is a pretty good turn based strategy game
recommended
do you enjoy not bathing having cancer or fighting over the city of buttfart for hours with your friends if you answered yes to any of these questions or if you really enjoy crying yourself to sleep in a hot sweat of frustration and disapointment then this game is for you this game is great it has caused me to permanently damage my mouse and my self esteem during the countless temper tantrums that this game promoted i was meant to be the supreme leader of a great nation but instead i sat and watched the glorious cities of buttfart fatnut and dickblood get defiled by the japanese sid meier is a sick man and so was ghandi
recommended
this game is ridiculously addiciting start a casual game at 3 in the afternoon and end up playing til 4 in the morning i love this game
recommended
civ v is an incredibly addicting game with solid diplomatic and military fighting dynamics along with excellent visuals and simple menus be warned though that the ais seem to be the largest s when it comes to asking for gold and when making dead im looking at you china anyways its a great game if you enjoy strategy
recommended
addictive watch your afternoon turn into the evening while trying to survive the world stage the dlc is a must as it completely revolutionizes the game sad about the mac version not having mod support unless you get tricky with the files but even then it causes instability still glad to have it on both devices
recommended
cool
recommended
this game is a sleep destroyer be prepared to lose your life if you start a game it starts as one more turn then ends tomorrow  if this game teaches you anything its dont trust the french or gandhi
recommended
turn based strategy all time top 3
recommended
litteraly the best turn based game in my opinion highly reccomend you buy this if you havent already
recommended
definitely one of the best games ive ever played
recommended
great game very easy to sink several hours into it without even realizing it
recommended
civilization v is a solid game not too much more to say its fun to play vanilla with many different ways of achieving victory culture science and domination for example and no two games turn out quite the same then when you include mods into the equation and you get even more playtime and fun i recently played a match as the kingdom of rohan on an 80x80 hex map of middle earth and man was that fun there are also mods that add enhanced functionality unique units gui tweaks and a whole slew of other changes that serve to spice up the experience definitely a solid pick up however id definitely advise getting gods and kings with it at the very least the gods and kings expansion adds a lot of content to the game that was sorely needed and they have added even more content to it with the newest expansion brave new world
recommended
amazingly fun highly reccomended
recommended
this game will eat your life
recommended
great game
recommended
550 hours in and i will say this you will experience alternate worlds histories unfold before you like who could forget the polish invasion of ur that caused intervention of the protestant egypt and saim in the year of 1964 perhaps you remember the 1678 discovery of a second continent that greeted brazil maya rome and china to the world stage or the atom bomb dropped on the aztec capital after its embargo on persia escalated to war in 2002 maybe some ancient events like the first trade route between the us and babylon in 2580bc you cant forsee all the events youll make and see in your civilizations trek for glory and that is why i keep coming back win or lose
recommended
great game i highly recommend this game
recommended
absolutely wonderful game easily the most accessible civ game for those new to the series and fun to fans of the series as well every expansion packdlc is worth it with the possible exception of the two newest map packs there is endless replayability options between the various ways to winfactions to playmaps which can be generated and thats not even scratching on the scenarios and other options ingame multiplayer is limited to eveyrone being on the server together and playing at the same time which can be a little difficult to do  a proper included playbyemail or something would be very appreciated but httpmultiplayerrobotcom works in a pinch anyway if you like strategy at all get this game
recommended
this is a brilliant game as i had never played a civ game before this one i had no idea what it would be like and i expected it to be too hard for me to play but the help and advice that this game gives you at all times is amazing and has really helped me to get into the swing of things dont trust the other civilizations though use them to your benefit but dont let them lull you into a false sense of security even if things are going well theres a large chance that theyll randomly just turn and denounce you or worse 910 would recommend this game to anyone who has to time to put into it
recommended
just dont think about it it is a steam must have
recommended
great game would recommend i have yet to try the expansions though
recommended
great for passing the hours without realising
recommended
one of the best strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing or simply losing a entire night of sleep to the replayable single player this is one game that any strategy enthusiast or casual player can enjoy
recommended
a great game and fun to play in single and multiplayer
recommended
this game is amazing in my opinion 1010
recommended
i would highly recommend this game its very addictive and with all the dlcs the game is just perfect and the multiplayer is very fun but watch out for the trade bug
recommended
this is an amazing game and it is definitely still my goty weve played hotseat mode for hours at my friends house but sadly after getting my own computer windows 8 and attempting to start the game it just closes before i can even get to the gameplay it is still a very good game though so rock on firaxis keep making great games
recommended
great strategy game

great

gandhi nuked me is was great

1010 civ v is hands down one of the best pc games ive ever played ive never experienced vanilla civ v but ive put in a lot of time into gods and kings which was pretty fun a little slow at times with not as much micromanaging and brave new world which gave the game to me a lot more playability added quite a few new features which i enjoy thoroughly especially due to the amount of gold it allows to be accumulated i definitely recommend getting both of the dlc for this game as each adds a little more that brings it closer to perfection my only complaint is that it can still get pretty slow but its hardly a deterrent from loving this game add a bit more micromanaging and its golden
recommended
well made game with a mostly intuitive interface and great game mechanics some minor glitches that can be resolved with mods and it just feels so satisfying taking over another civilization and claiming the continent to yourself also the interaction between leaders adds an interesting perspective and convinces you that these are real civilizations you are blowing up with your giant death robots
recommended
extremely good game random maps provide large replayability and hours and hours of gameplay each game lots of strategy and balance is neeeded by the player to make a proporus civilization you can even play with friends also brave new world makes it a 1000 times better
recommended
you guy should get this its so much fun with multiple people
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is the game that you play in the morning laying in bed sipping a cup of tea and laying in bed however you will look up after a couple hundred turns and realize that you have been playing for 3 days as i always say if its on sale buy it if it isnt  wait cuz it will be
recommended
best game ever i wasnt sure if i would like it as i had not played the earlier versions but as i had experience with age of mythology and other similar games this was only 10x better though age of myth will always have a place in my heart
recommended
a very fun gameand very entertaining
recommended
this game will take all your free time away and no matter how long you try and resist and walk away from you computer you will always return
recommended
im nowhere near a big fan of strategy games real time or turnbased and cant really say im a big fan of anyexcept this series which i adore and this game is no exception difficulty levels go from 1tutorial level difficulty here to 9i barely won a single game at 5 so anyone can find their sweet spot if you do not have any interest in history i can almsot guarentee that this game will change that so many quotes by famous people in history many leaders and civs to choose from units go from men with stones tied to stick to the kind of warfare we have now with a single unit that goes beyond multiple ways to winthere is a ludicrious amount of content in this game if you are any sort of fan of history or strategy games or simply just good games you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this

colonize europe as the aztecs prevent your citizens from reproducing in the course of 180 years in order to build the eiffel tower before mongolia build a submerged kremlin cause you didnt have enough space on land get nuked twentyeleven times by gandhi invent the internet before anyone has ever heard about the computer rain death upon japanese crossbowmen with your f22s in the 17th century rename the world congress to a bunch of s get somebody to wage war on you cause on of your cities happens to be next to mt fuji 110 for historical inaccuracy

recommended
53 hours in to the game and i am still loving it civilization v is my first game in the civilization series and now that i got it i dont understand why i never played the others you start the game off with one group of settlers and a warrior to protect them from there you start building your civilization its not like other strategy games where you literally build every single building the map is devided into hexagonal tiles with different resources all you have to do is build your settlement and from there on expand to the surrounding tiles as you play you unlock new buildings to upgrade your settlements you can found new settlements as freely as you like but you always run risk of attack so make sure you have the proper amount of troops to protect those new found bottom feeding settlements of yours there are 5 ways to win the game domination victory science victory cultural victory diplomatic victory or a score victory but this means there are 5 ways for you to get beaten as well so you will need to not only keep an eye on your own civilization but your enemys aswell and know exactly when its time to attack or ally up if you get tired of the standard game check out the scenarios that is where the real fun begins with scenarios that actually happened like the boers vs the zulus in africa the mayans who feared the end of the world and all the troubles they faced like the french invading them with weapons they have never even seen before in their lives the scenarios have it all and if thats not enough civilization v supports the steam workshop so there are endless mods for you to choose from to spice your game up even more the game is very easy to learn with the help of your advisers who even though they can be pretty annoying sometimes make sure you know what you are doing and what the consequences will be if you take a certain action they will take good care of you my rating 910  1 the game sometimes feels like its taking forever to finish but there are settings to change the game speed which will sort this out for you but i found that on standard settings the game takes forever and on quick settings you cant help but feel extremely rushed it would have been nice to have something in between  buy this game its amazing
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is the best strategy game currently on the market civ v is a game of economy science culture diplomacy and warfare this turnbased strategy game was originally a board game and is worth buying and getting dlc for
recommended
can keep me happy for hours amazing strategy 1010
recommended
you thought you were going to do something today nope
recommended
i love it its an easytouse turnbased strategy game that changes each time you play each update is an attempt to balance civilizations which is good it also has a lot of distance between each new iteration civilization iv was years and years ago so its not like theyre pumping out lowquality products for a quick buck my complaints are that this new game put features of the old game into dlc like religion its also completely eliminated corporations though a new take on it comes along in brave new world overall its a good game but get the bundle at a discount
recommended
you will accidentally play this for 5 hours in a row if you arent careful
recommended
if you like nukes youll like this game if you had a depressing child hood being a russian orphan who ended up dreaming about world domination in the form of shoving your  into all kinds of things that may or may not involve pointy objects and diplomacy you will love this game if you hate turn based combat or montezuma ramming his jaguars into your capital because he is that angry well you may just tolerate the game 100 score wins gold medal and yes i will undress for you george washington blushes

good game to kill some time

recommended
one of the best turn based strategy games ever created
recommended
just one more turn thats the phrase the has been uttered by almost everyone who has ever played a civ game this game is no exception the music is tailored to the civilization you play the graphics are beautiful the strategy is intense you will find yourself plotting your next victory whether it is through military force economic maneuvering or scientific research different ways to win or lose so position your forces and click next turn
recommended
this game is fantastic wether you are playing with or against friends or just playing by yourself it makes you have a sense of accomplishment through completing the smallest of tasks this game also does not have a campaign wich reallly makes the player concintrate on having fun instead of beating the game also when playing with friends it does not create teams you decide if you want to win the control of civilizations through war or diplomacy the player decides who he wants to befriend or declare war with i have a fealing that this will eventually ruin a few friendships

very fun game youll find yourself playing for long periods at a time for what will seem like 30 minutes for you you will get addicted to it and want to finish the game before you do anything else even when you finish your first match you might want to play again theres no problem with that either as there different ai difficulties  randomly genrated maps and varing civs with there own special perksonce youve mastered all of that you can try to mod the game  this game has many creative and smart players that made there own custom maps  civs or scenarios if you have a friend thats plays the game you could play with them if you are a stratagy game fan or just like the feeling of creating your own empire and nation then this is a can not miss

sonic adventure is the final digital installment of the sonic the hedghog series for the sega dreamcast despite foiling robotnick countless times sonic is in way over his head this time as a mysterious demon beast threatens humanity he must team up with some old favorites and some new unlikely heroes to save his wild world from total devastation before you getting excited you might wanna pump the brakes this game is kind of a dud sad to say the best part is when you fish with one of the cadillac cats otherwise you got a janky platformer due to sonic teams inability to translate sonic buttery smooth style to the 3rd dimension worst of all the whole game takes place in some outdoor mall with real humans if you stay next to one long enough they will give you a piece of kibble and a pat on the head there werent many worse ways to end the 90s than to play this game while listening to jimmies chicken shack i didnt know no better me know better now not the adventure i was looking for thanks sonic you nitwit

recommended
when was the last time you saw ghandi nuke an entire civilzation exactly you havent buy civ v
recommended
solid and in depth turn based strategy games take just about forever to complete especially when youve got a large bunch of players regardless its a lot of fun and very interesting to those who appreciate management type things in their games
recommended
this game is amazing in my opinion 1010
recommended
i would highly recommend this game its very addictive and with all the dlcs the game is just perfect and the multiplayer is very fun but watch out for the trade bug
recommended
this is an amazing game and it is definitely still my goty weve played hotseat mode for hours at my friends house but sadly after getting my own computer windows 8 and attempting to start the game it just closes before i can even get to the gameplay it is still a very good game though so rock on firaxis keep making great games
recommended
great strategy game

gandhi nuked me is was great
recommended
1010 civ v is hands down one of the best pc games ive ever played ive never experienced vanilla civ v but ive put in a lot of time into gods and kings which was pretty fun a little slow at times with not as much micromanaging and brave new world which gave the game to me a lot more playability added quite a few new features which i enjoy thoroughly especially due to the amount of gold it allows to be accumulated i definitely recommend getting both of the dlc for this game as each adds a little more that brings it closer to perfection my only complaint is that it can still get pretty slow but its hardly a deterrent from loving this game add a bit more micromanaging and its golden
recommended
well made game with a mostly intuitive interface and great game mechanics some minor glitches that can be resolved with mods and it just feels so satisfying taking over another civilization and claiming the continent to yourself also the interaction between leaders adds an interesting perspective and convinces you that these are real civilizations you are blowing up with your giant death robots
recommended
extremely good game random maps provide large replayability and hours and hours of gameplay each game lots of strategy and balance is neeeded by the player to make a proporus civilization you can even play with friends also brave new world makes it a 1000 times better
recommended
you guy should get this its so much fun with multiple people
recommended
amazing civlizing game anyway it is really fun espicaly scince u can launcher nuclear weapons 4 no reson at other ppl amazing game buy it now
recommended
i have been playing civilization since day 1 1991 and now in the year 2014 i cant wait for byond earth add on
recommended
this game is worth the money i bought it the first year it came out but i constantly come back to play it after a while especially since im a history buff every playthrough is different even if you still use the same strategy everytime i would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who loves strategy games but i also think this game is a great starter for those who dont usually play strategy games and want to jump into them 910
recommended
at first i was not wholly impressed with this installment in the famed civilization v franchise i thought the new hexagonal tiles and inability to stack units really restricted the game dynamic but as it turns out these changes as well as graphical updates are what makes civilization v even better than its predecessors in civilization iv you could stack units on top of units on top of units often combat strength was dictated by the amount of time and resources you put into building so many units now you can only have one unit per tile and you cant even have units walk over each other this makes the game much more strategy based and this works especially well in multiplayer the hexagonal tiles also make for much less blocky world generation and more countour overall i love with this installment of civilization i would much rather play civ v than civ iv which is good because civ iv doesnt work on my computer anymore
recommended
this is probably the most influential game of my generation
recommended
was julius ceaser made archers ghandi declared war on me and i was killed by queen elizabeth 1010

love it goes threw history great sound affects music and art
recommended
a great game that combines strategy warmongering and building the ai needs a huge improvement though i got washington down to his last city and he demanded that i give him all my money and luxury resources for peace
recommended
fun and addicting
recommended
probably the greatest turn based strategy game ive played to date with all the different victory conditions map layouts and leaders its like playing a different game each time the games do take a long time though especially playing with others be prepared to sit down for 6 hours and play or you can do pitboss games and the game also alows you to safe it and pick it up later
recommended
another great game though i stopped bying the addons samey samey
recommended
addiction
recommended
needless to say if you want a turn based strategy game believe me when i tell you this is it however its hard for me to recommend this to someone who is planning to buying just the vanilla no dlc included edition of the 255 hours on this game ive spent at least 50 of those on the vanilla and back then i felt as though the game had less game play than the previous game in the franchise civ 4 so if youre getting this game i highly recommend you get the gold edition you get the core game the gods and kings dlc and a bunch of scenario packs never used and civilizations which i have found to be very viable in game such as korea my other biggest complaint is that the ai do sometimes cheat now based on your definition of what difficult ai means you might be fine with this my personal definition of a difficult ai is one who is given the same basic resources as an ai on an easier difficulty but is much better at deciding on what to do and how to use those resources civ 5 believes that a more difficult ai has more resources than the easier ai and the player despite this i still believe civ 5 is the based turn based strategy due to the sheer amount of strategies you can use to explore expand and conquer
recommended
just onemoreturn one of the best strategy games i have ever played
recommended
this game will make you hate foreigners
recommended
its great
recommended
this game is very time consuming but you meet tons of new people and develop skills like strategies and diplomatic abilities this game is like life risk chess and facebook all thrown in a blender to get this game
recommended
i spent like 40 hours playing this game in the first 3 days the variety of civilizations and their characteristcs fused with the game concepts itself will make you spend hours instead of minutes you intended to i strongly not recommend for those who has limited time to play or has some work to do
recommended
good to play with friends even better to play by yourself 1010 recommended
recommended
have nothing to do for 9 hours
recommended
probably the best turnbased god game everafter the first four games civ v has lots of improvements there is no more religion which is probably a better idea and has citystates which are a quite good idea also the interface is much more streamlinedthere are a lot of options for your civilization from america to francealso now the game is on a hexbased grid its a lot better than the old squarebased gridyou need to take your civilization from cavemen to the futurewatching as you advance in technogly run low on money and try to regain ityou are invaded and denouced as you need to built farmsnew citiesminesquarrys an excellent game 1010
recommended
i love playing stratgy games and civ 5 is by far the most in depth best graphics on a stratgy game other than rome total war 2 every game can be played differntly and stratigies vary so its all up to you
recommended
this is a very fun game to play for people who like a challenge although i do recommend watching someone play the game because there are hints the game is still hard for beginners i bought the civ gold edition & i want to buy brave new world so yes play the game and friend me on steam so we can play on civ together
recommended
great game has given me hours of fun and i can see many more hours ahead i defiently recommend this game to anyone who like strategy and to who like destroying their friends in all out war
recommended
i like the part when gahnid dies from obamas bomb
recommended
this is a amazing game so much effort and time put into the game dont expect to just start and be good at it as it takes many games to know what your doing and sometimes you still find something knew amazing replay value i could play this all day
recommended
as much as i enjoy strategy games i had never played any of the civilizations before one of my friends gifted this game to me a while ago and i had to try it out i ended up getting hooked to it i enjoyed it so much my older brother had decided to get me some of the expansions its amazingly simple to figure out and you can get the hang of it fast i had no idea how to play the game when i first started but with time i was able to figure it out pros has a really great tutorial for new players to help learn the mechanics of the game huge range of civilizations and unique stats for each tons of different maps and game styles able to played with friends or ai wonderful mods on the workshop cons some of the mods dont always install properlynot really their fault easy to get addicted to and lose track of time if youre on a team with other ai when youre at war and about to take a city they will steal it from you
recommended
good strategy game worth the money

it is very fun but there needs to be more balance within the races for instance venice needs some hard nerfs whilist civs like sweeden need to be greatly increased it is fun because the bots are super easy to beat even on deity because of have finished it on deity there is nothing else wrong but please venice needs to be fixed

recommended
this game is amazing get it
recommended
sid meiers latest entry in the award winning civilization series is fantastic it allows you to rule a country however you would like be it peacefully allying yourself with others or steamrolling them with the feet of your armies the two expansions although steeply priced is a must for the full experience and i reccomend the dlc strongly if you love 4x games and have a lot of money in gifted steam cards than i highly reccomend considering civilization v however if you couldnt put a lot of time into one saved game a standard game could be awhile then you might want to look at less time intensive titles 1010
recommended
buy this game and it will eat your brains 010 needs shrek civ
recommended
its a great game full of adventures and upgrades you can research really excisting projects and monuments it looks a bit like age of empires ii but i think this game is more fun and more expensive
recommended
game constantly crashes i rarely go 10 turns without having to restart the whole game this is with running off 8 gb of ram with an intel core i5 processor very frustrating on the rate occasion the game works it is a great game and highly addictive
recommended
a game that makes me feel great creating the single most authoritarian superior atheist society on the planet while i send my crusade of euphoric intelligence across the planet in a stream of blood tears and nukes all in the name of chairman walrus all hail the hail the master of euphoria 710 it was okay

so many varied ways to play accurate to historical content is a lot of fun to play with friends online with only a little occasional lag 550 played hours and still not bored with the game great strategy based game dont buy if you like games that dont involve lucky chance
recommended
this game is like when you pee in a coconut and than later look at it under a microscope just to realize that your new pee humanoids are getting nuked by ghandi 1010 hoe
recommended
where should i start this game is absolutely amazing it has so many things you can do such as reenact historical events see what it would be like if different civilizations began in a different part of the world or play against your friends in an intense race to see how can dominate the world not only can you achieve domination victories but your nation can also excel and thrive with science cultural and faith victories no matter what civilization you are you can build any world wonder you desire as long as youre in the correct time period and meet the requirements of course all in all this game is great fun providing hours and hours of fun and that will only be one game tldr you can build giant death robots towards the end 1010
recommended
amazing game i would say one of the easiest to control and fun strategy game ever
recommended
only 268 moves in and already have thought about fighting 
recommended
dont play this with the lights off its scarier than amnesia
recommended
every time i recommend somebody this game i just tell them the story of the guy that played a single civ ii match for over 10 years in the far future the game has been able to reproduce all of the details of a distopic scifi future world all but 3 cultures have survived and these 3 has become supernations in a constant war against each other lasted more than a 1000 years most of the lands were devastated by the postnuclear war fallout and the people of these superpowers were starving because their leaders were spending all the resources available in war efforts even when the player was willing to withdraw from the war it was simply not possible because of the greed and the need for resources of the other two nations so when i fire up my civ game i always deactivate each type of victory i wanna go see the future
recommended
nothing like it best strategy game on the market right now 10010 would get nuked by a  off ghandi again
recommended
this game is absolouteley recommended and super fun there are still a few bugs but i will talk about that later if you turn the graphics on high it all looks so good its amazing the animations  fighting running moving are some of the best ever the only bugs i have found are the workers sometimes will build things and they never show up and i have to restart the game
recommended
define fun and boring at the same time
recommended
great strategy game for wasting hours on end 1010
recommended
its a good game but if u get it make sure to get the dlc otherwise its not worth it
recommended
buy this game and give it a chance a couple of hours in and you will be addicted when youve reached the addictedstage it can last for hundreds and hundreds of hours when the addiction slowly disappears the game will still continue to give you a fair amount of entartainment for the years to come
recommended
this is the best game i have ever played it has consumed me and remade me into a human being with dreams
recommended
this is by far the best game that i have ever played entirely worth getting it however civ beyond earth sounds like its going to be even better than civ 5 which is a difficult criterium to fill
recommended
ive never played civilization before but after playing for almost constantly my first 18 hours all what i must say is just wow i get it on sale and its really worth it need to go to work but just one more turn lose your job but its gonna be alright just one more turn your house is burning but one more turn

recommended

do not play if youve promised yourself just 20 minutes for that will pass in a blink of an eye civ 5 maybe the most recent the most expansive and potentially most daunting of the classic civilization series  reinforced with a 234page manual that comes with it with those factors in mind its easy to imagine strategy newcomers running away from civ 5 in droves but give it another look please civ 5 is the culmination of over 20 years of series development each game has been better than the last which is a feat in itself  and welcomes both seasoned veterans and newbies alike the devs have beavered away on features that worked and ditched those that players felt weak however the single most impressive attribute about civ 5 is the ability to play the game how you want to play it want to be a peaceloving pacifist society you can be want to be a total powermongering and ruthless despot again your choice i wish i had more space to promote this buy it  910
recommended
its boring historically an inaccurate mess not immersive and slow paced as all hell also one of the greatest damn strategy games ive played and know it to be the best ill play for long until civ vi that is supports a ton of playstyles and even losing a game would not bother as its incredibly fun to just build and develop your empire also watch out starting it once means all of your games will dust in your steam library for the next one to four weeks
recommended
a game for people like me who have a craps load of time to create a civilization anyway its a lot of fun try it out
recommended
civilization v an indepth stategy game with historical figures and events sid meier knows stategy and when there are at times over 90000 people still playing civ v to this day you see the proof how well this stategy game is made stategy games have always been my take a break from the shooter games civ v is the best of that break if there is one strategy game to buy civ v is it is it your time to jump in to history and have the control
recommended
great gamethis game will have you say yeah ill play for a little bit and there you are 5 hours later and you keep saying one more turnone more turn

recommended
great work that worth your money and time
recommended
best civ yet only being allowed one unit of each type combatnoncombat per tile really changes the game from previous entries and while the multiplayer mode right now may feel a bit slimmed down its still fun with friends definitely suggest it if youre a fan of turn based strategy games
recommended
getting serious while playing a tutorial not even the learn as you play one so why not this nuke simulator would be great if you can make it to nuclearish situation 1010 alexander would be my gandhi again oh and6868 nukes my wallet and worth it on sale if you want that nuke misses the targetat least misses your wallet

recommended
great game love it
recommended
this is a really good game if you enjoy being tactical with things its really nice for planning out strategies or just ing around making war with everyone i really do recommend it its awesome
recommended
as a civilization veteran having played through iii and iv extensively i thought that civilization v stayed true to the rest of the series while making excellent improvements and additions the game is a polished tested and free of any discernible bugs the ui is more intuitive than that of civilization iii and the overlay options allow you to view the map area in terms of whichever factors you see fit the concept of nonstacking units is also surprisingly good gone are the painful lategame turns of managing a bloated military civilization v encourages a more diverse style of play wherein pursuing cultural diplomatic militaristic scientific or time victory is a choice that does markedly affect your style of play more so than in prequels this is largely due to the citystate mechanic as well as the social policy mechanic a complaint i had with the previous titles in the series was the tendency for domination victory to be the most effective strategy by far in this game however i feel the developers have done an excellent job in making every victory type to be worthwhile unique and effective in their own rights thanks to the many improvements made to the series in this game and the adherance of the developers to the root mechanics of civ i think this is a great game for civ fans and probably the best ever for new players
recommended
umm okay this was a pretty fun game but there was no sid meier civilization included in the game and it has yet to be patched in so either change the title and quit misleading your customers or i will write about this in my blog youve been warned 101000 a
recommended
hours and hours of slaughtering any empire that dared to denounce you during your early stages and eventually conquering the entire world is probably the most fun ive had with a game that involves slaughtering entire countries

this game is recommended by me
recommended
pretty good game just the right balance of war and diplomacy with science religion and culture tossing things up
recommended
probably the best strategy game ive ever played and i am now going to be a long time fan of the series
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
base game is solid the expansion turns it into a brilliant and balanced game only issue i have with it is that it is so good that it makes you want to play it with friends and the multiplayer is the most unstable thing i ever experienced in a game and you play it anyway cursing sid meier every step of the way because it is good enough to make you wade through the suffering of constant disconnects
recommended
excellent game for those who want a game with good strategies and many options available great soundtrack and user interface is very clean
recommended
my wife hates this game five stars
recommended
this is a great game you can spend hours playing either casually or competitively this is the best turn based strategy game i have ever played and would recommend it to everyone even if the genre is not one you would normally play
recommended
if you are prone to addictions do not buy this game 1010 would get addicted again
recommended
when i lost contact with my friends the ai in this game did suffice overall a really fun game can be a bit enraging if youre not prepared for a situation 1010
recommended
this game has taken a lot of my time probably not even close to as much as other people who play this it is a very accessable game but also can be complexed i recommend getting the expansions as the final expansion adds more importance to faith and culture this game can be addictive though i played 3 playthroughs by the end of the 3rd night i had 20 hours into it
recommended
best turned based strategy i own
recommended
its really good both single player and multiplayer have mods which make the game wayy more fun and the features are all polished and cool however there are still a couple bugs which have been in here for soo long and havent been fixed but all in all its pretty good
recommended
simply awesome
recommended
gameplay 55 builds stress at all the right times and certain ai add extra flavor graphics 45 takes a bit of time and tinkering to run smoothly and your computer definitely will get a little toasty but this is made up for by the stunning amount of resources the game can handle at once design 55 the devil is in the details and civ is packed with bells and whistles on every tile the ui can appear daunting at first but in the long run becomes incredibly simplistic sound 45 the score and narration really enhance the immersion and make your civilizations story all the more epic multiplayer 35 the only aspect of the game that is just average the graphics and amount of ai the game can handle take a significant blow in multiplayer and the way the game freezes entirely if youre at war with another player and its their turn can be frustrating the lack of achievement support in multiplayer is also a bit disappointing pc factor 55 the mod support is absolutely fantastic and propels this game to be a staple of pc gaming replay factorachievements 55 by the end of one really long game you will have a full understanding of how to play and be ready to rack up another hundred hours over the course of two days this game will make you think thats possible civilization v is the kind of game that may lead you to rehab but thatll only hurt your loved ones and youre two turns away from learning how to build a giant atomic robot so who cares overall 89
recommended
great game if you like turn based strategy especially fun when playing with friends 55
recommended
gud game >_> unless you play with my friends
recommended
civilization 5 is highly addicting and is a very good choice if you want to make a lot of time disappear before you even realize it was gone if youve tried the previous civilization titles and didnt find them fun give civlization 5 a try it plays more like a strategy board game then previous titles
recommended
all is fair in love and not now you barbarian keds

one of the best strategy games ever i never get bored playing this game i always come back and play more of it i highly recommend this game 
recommended
literally cant stop playing ever

brilliant game wish i had brave new world though my only complaint is that the palace view that was in civ 3 is gone but i gtg and play more civ 5
recommended
the best of the civ series and with each new expansion it gets better and better 1010

for the person that wants to rewrite history from the comfort of their own home this is the game for you

cannot play as sid meier himself and the civilization is not his dont be fooled
recommended
once you get into this game a whole new world opens up where you first only saw some numbers fresh strategies appear its also relatively easy to learn so dont be intimidated
recommended
play as a civilization and bring forth your country from the dawn of time to the end of it or untill everybodys dead by nukes create vast tech and armys and a stunning culture to shun the world in your mightyness or share it all and be a  but that will never happen
recommended
awesome game to lose track of time and play for hours on end
recommended
good game lots of replay value and lots of mods in the workshop
recommended
great game
recommended
i would greatly reccomend this game for anyone who likes strategy games this has already given me hours of fun with many more to come im certain the multiplayer featre is epic allowing you to save and resume a game at any time later which is very useful for me the ai is very good it is reasonable as far as i can see i have not played the other civilization games so i am not comparing this game to others like it but i would definitely reccomend this game for you to purchase it is well worth your money
recommended
civ 5 is a great game if you have tons of time to pour in or very little one of the few games i love recomending
recommended
my wife hates this game five stars
recommended
this is a great game you can spend hours playing either casually or competitively this is the best turn based strategy game i have ever played and would recommend it to everyone even if the genre is not one you would normally play
recommended
if you are prone to addictions do not buy this game 1010 would get addicted again
recommended
when i lost contact with my friends the ai in this game did suffice overall a really fun game can be a bit enraging if youre not prepared for a situation 1010
recommended
this game has taken a lot of my time probably not even close to as much as other people who play this it is a very accessable game but also can be complexed i recommend getting the expansions as the final expansion adds more importance to faith and culture this game can be addictive though i played 3 playthroughs by the end of the 3rd night i had 20 hours into it
recommended
this game is the shizznits
recommended
this game is fantasticthere is so much depth and content
recommended
its a great time killer and is even better to play with friends i recommend checking out the workshop for mods with this game as they can add countries or leaders that arent recognized in the game or in the dlcs
recommended
great game i can and do get lost in it for hours
recommended
this game along with every civilization game is both the greatest and worst thing that has ever happened to me i love to play but the horrible addiction that is just one more turn has kept me up or away from work so many countless times im almost not a functioning human anymore want to sink days of your life into something but civ v
recommended
good game lots of fun easy to learn hard to get good at
recommended
favorite game of all time hands down hundreds of hours of gameplay later and i still dont have it mastered highly recommended
recommended
the great life destroyer that keeps improving with every xpac the game is a true successor to a legacy that started over 20 years ago dont be fooled by the date this came out its still a game with next to no equals in terms of the turn based strategy genre the learning curve might look steep at first glance but i assure you that mastering the basics game will come faster than you think for the over 1500 hours of gaming i have recorded in the game i am still someone who barely did any scenarios to keep the game fun dont forget to crank up the difficulty as the challenge that is brought by the highest difficulty levels will bring out the true test of your abilities
recommended
a great turnbased strategy game really fun when you get the hang off it
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is one of the best games i have ever played but i would recommend getting the brave new world expansion as it enhances the gameplay greatly i have literally spent hours playing with my friends losing every time but the experience of the game in itself is what makes this game truly remarkable a masterpiece
recommended
quite possibly the best turn based strategy game on the market
recommended
a turn based strategy game civilization v continues the classic civilization series
recommended
became friends with gandhi we made many trades and research agreements then he just ran over me with elephants and nuked my capital 1011

recommended
say goodbye to your life

im pretty sure this is my most played game on steam with as of right now roughly 177 hours or so of gametime that tells you something right there as thats a lot of time to put into playing a game in truth this is one of my favorite strategy games and one i have played for years now since i first bought it on my birthday a few years ago the fun of building a civilization and dominating all of my opponents keeps me coming back again and again with the addition of the steam workshop a while back the game got even better and now i only play with mods 910
recommended
its kinda like civilization revolutions for xbox 360 and ps3 only much better
recommended
just 1 more turn is what you will say after every turn of any game of civ v this game is very fun for you turn based strategy fans
recommended
mechanicly solid  simplifiedstreamlined gameplay  one more turn every playthough is its own adventure  granted your willing to set your own goals civ has always been about more than just a videogame recreation of history its always left the player with a sense of achievement moreso then just the players own but rather the grandeur of what our race has managed in such a short time its the sense of optimism and hope that stems from those achievements that is so special and makes any version of civ worth at least a try
recommended
very solid experience for a wide audience mold your own story play your own way and make your own rules on top of the already solid vanilla experience the steam workshop truly makes this game shine brighter than its predecessors dont buy this if you have no time on your hands because youll be itching to spend a whole weekend on it
recommended
one of my favorite games of all time few games have provided the amount of single and multi player hours civ and its expansions have
recommended
1010 epic warmonger
recommended
a fun game that you will lose yourself hours if your not paying atttention
recommended
amazing game endless possiblities and if you get bored theres always fun mods
recommended
amazing strategy game and even better for people who like to play with turns
recommended
but it free xp
recommended
well to start civ is an amazing game even if you dont have friends to play with the ai isnt a pushover and can be quite challenging based on your difficulty level but playing with friends is where all the fun is at you can build up your own empires and then take down your own friends in so many different and strategic ways i should warn you the game requires a lot of time as each game runs for a few hours or more also it is very complicated at first so dont get overwhelmed and finally this is a very strategic game it requires a lot of straetgies to take down opponents and win but other than that have fun
recommended
always addicting i love how much more in depth this one is than revolution definitely suggest buying it
recommended
say youll play it for an hour 8 hours later well i think thats enough for one night 1010
recommended
love this game would recommend it missed the first time expansions went on sale but got it the 2nd time arround
recommended
this game is great to play with friends and is very addictive
recommended
one of the best games ive played
recommended
if you love total war games this is a great change for you it also provides mp which is great if you are into rulling the world with your bff it has a large variety and gives the player so much to do and choose from you will never get bored from the wide range of civilizations to choose from
recommended
excellent game just enough of everything i played original g&k and bnw while there are some thing id like to see improved amazing game overall
recommended
this game is one of the best ive ever played its a deep simulation game that is good to play in both single player and multiplayer id definately recommend this to any strategy fan that has somehow missed this i think that this with bnw is better than civ iv but civ iv is good too
recommended
you may have heard jokes regarding this game and its ilk that go something along the lines of just one more turn oh hey its 6am you are mistaken those are not jokes
recommended
who knew a strategy game could be so dang fun
recommended
i turned gandhi into a militaristic s that hoarded oranges and then i slaughtered everyone that was alive then my people started to rebel i left to take a  and i lost after i won best game ever 1010

i created masochism best game 2050 1510 wood bang
recommended
a great way to lose seven hours without realising it if youre going to play this game be prepared to lose track of time very easily
recommended
before i continue the vanillia game is little more then a demo for the real game this game is only worth playing with all the major expansion packs gods and kings  brave new world unless you can get all 3 dont bother this is because religion espionage trade routes a world congress tourism great works and 18 new civs are added with theses expansions without these two expansions there is no economy religion nothing to do but grind tech and build military units which is boring the vanillia game is little more then a demo for the real game having beaten this game on all its difficulties i can for sure say civ 5 has put me through my paces with the full game there are limitless hours of civworlddifficulty combos that can be further tweaked with advanced setup the game doesnt really cheat hard until the last difficulty which is better than most games because there are a total of 8 difficulties with 5 6 and 7 being hard but not impossible if you play this game on windows then the game is worth double its money because civ5 has one of the best modding communities on the steam workshop thousands of mods to change the mechanics of the game along with thousands of new civs with just as good if not better quality of the vanilla ones this game is a staple in the strategy community and is the best civ yet you manage economy as well as city building and commanding armies pretty much the same as civ4 with better graphics and a revamped community through steam workshop if you like strategy then give this game a try
recommended
phenomenal honestly if youre a fan of 4x poltics management or strategy games this is truly a staple customization replayability and incredibly addicting gameplay keep people playing this for hundreds and thousands of hours the game has one major flaw and thats if you get the base game with no expansions packs or dlc then it can feel empy which is a flaw though at this point with all the bundle sales if you can get anything along with it it feels fleshed out and is probably one of the best games on the market for your money considering how many hours of gameplay it gives
recommended
this game is off the hizzy
recommended
i can spend years playing this game fun solo player and fun with friends d a great way to destroy your friends egos
recommended
provides hours of entertainment some games can last days but its always fun playing as a civilization you like versus those you dont almost like making up your own history
recommended
this was the first civ ive ever play it is a lot better than i thought it would be i give it my stamp of approval
recommended
play gandhi  build lots of cities  easy game
recommended
45 hours into this game and watched a 117 part playlist of it this game is a must buy
recommended
civilization v this game is truly amazing and deserving of the title pc game of the year the base game in itself is a massive title with loads of replay value the additions to the series are truly noticable and they all play out perfect the policy trees are something can be very helpful if taken advantage of properly the use and importance of citystates is something that wasnt seen before and they only get better in the brave new world expansion the introduction of relgion is gods and kings is also a great mechanic for working with citystates and other civs combat is something that was really impressed me its in depth with many factors practically in every single tile and with the abilities that you gain leveling up your units or the unqiue ablitesunits that come with a certain civ speaking of the civilizationsthe choices of the leaders you have is plentiful to say the least it has something for everybody a must purchase title for any gamer who enjoys rts strategy and turnbased really just if you like video games buy this one if you want a rating55 9810 two thumbs up 99100 and just damn amazing guys
recommended
got it yesterday already have 20 hours in it on the path to ruining my life
recommended
civy 5 is great like the classic and best thing about civ5 is the workshop they had added civy 4 and 3 were great games and i still play them over civy5 but dont get this wrong civy5 is still a great game and does change the gameplay abit civy 5 puts you in a world of conflict and desire building & war the gameplay factor for this is pretty good and always has been feeling like a game should with a boardgame element that fits perfectly together some turns and games are very long but many options mods and settings can change that fun factor 67 graphics 65 sfx 70 gameplay 50 total rating 62

this game will ruin your life i bought this game looking for a simple way to kill a few hours i started playing it two years ago and looked up this morning at it turns out it is 2014 now

absolutely love everything about the game

excellent game its so addictive youll look up one day and realise its the year 2050
recommended
civilization v this is franchise is so addicting it should be said as a warning this turn based stratagy game lets you take on the role of a leader of a nation and let you manage all aspects of the nation from diplomacy to economics the game leads you through the technological advancements of mankind and will let the wars waged go from man wearing clubs to aircraft carriers with fighter planes the management is very in depth and there are many ways you can manage your civilisation and lead your people to victory a small example is that you can let your city construct wonders of the world that take up a lot of production time or can say i do not want to waste time on that and focus on developing the infrastructures and or armies of your nation there are to many aspects to praise in this game and i have played civ 1 back in the day this game has come allong way and i will gladly see this game be rememberd as a great game storyplot 810 this is a hard one since the storyplot is history replayed by you therefor i will rate this based on accuracy on history the game follows the history books and is therefor spot on but since it does not really have its own story to tell i cannot give it a 9510 but i will go with a 810 diversity in ai 810 the ai reacts on dilpomatic discisions of the player knows how to do an attack and has moods programmed into it solid and since the update quiet a while ago  i have no bad things to say about it mechanics 910 [b] solic mechanics very in depth managing so thats the best part of this game and its what makes the game so addictive environment 710 the variaty of tiles is great but the different arts for the same tile seems limited voice acting 8510 the voice acting for the english version is great calming voice for narratives and the authenthic languages for the leaders really is a plus in my book flexible story na [u] overal 85 [u] on the side note i have played more then my currently displayed time but this was all before steam do not worry i have quiet the exsperience with this game 
recommended
civ 5 is great enough said
recommended
this game isnt bad it also isnt good buy it if youve played the other civs and need a fix if youre just getting into the franchise wait for the next one
recommended
the best waste of time ever devised 1010 probably one of the few must have games on steam it runs on practicaly any machine and has some of the most addictive stratagy that never gets old even if you are not usualy a stratagy fan this game is for everyone becuase of its simple nature and easy to get to grips with systems this game is best enjoyed with a low paced netflix series for maximum enjoyment and time wasting
recommended
a truly excellent turnbased strategy game just be careful not to get sucked in its addictive and games tend to last several hours each
recommended
fun game to play alone or with friends few improvements needed for the ai when playing against computers but still i played many exciting hours multiplayer is a bit tricky as one game can last manymanymany hours all players have to be available at the same time i recommand this game you can start playing alone but then play with friends and your alliance will give the game a new dimension
recommended
this game is tight as hell
recommended
great game i have played over 110 hours and it never gets old
recommended
i forgot i had a girlfriend after the first turn

civilization continues to deliver one of the primier strategy game experiences there is little negative to say about the fifth installment of the civilization series which prides itself on its immense amount of features and challenging gameplay its game mechanics are incredibly in depth balanced and well researched the game is only made better by its fantastic and well worth the cost dlc which adds new scenarios world leaders and features such as religion the experience is even better when playing with friends and foes in a multiplayer match the only cons to this game may be the learning curve as there is definitely a lot to take in another gripe with the game is the amount of time it consumes an average game may last more than 10 hours and with the amount of different civilizations scenarios and features to play and master this may seem a bit daunting friends that are familiar and play this game call it a one way time machine this meaning you sit down and start and then snap back to reality 8 hours later without much sense of the amount of time that flew by would i recommend it yes a thousand times yes it my personal favorite strategy game of all time and is well worth the cost 10  10 note if you arent enthused with it as a single player match i would highly recommend getting some friends together and trying it as fast paced as possible playing against eachother
recommended
ah sid meiers weve had so much together in peace in understanding from alpha centrurialien crossfire and more apon hours and hours of gameplay i cant possibily know how many but this review is for the 5th installtion of sid meiers civilization as you should know personally i have problems with this game from multiplayer and single player campaign i have many things i enjoy in this game but at the same time it gives me emotions that i cant describe its not a good feeling or a bad one its the small things that naw at me like the choice of civilizations which arent really interesting others may argue that this game is perfect it is in somethings because they have had time to tweek it from sms civ 1 and all other sms games between back then and now but this is not diffinate worldembodyment of human culture i mean sure if you are looking at this review and your thinking should i buy this game and will i have fun with it as a gamer you might or might not be disappointed depending on what you think a fun game is is it nuking a civilization that will randomly make war with you because your close to their border by their country or will they spy on you because your a ally to them and have been friends with them from the beginning of the game i think not i will say this though if you are one that likes to use your mind in games you will love this game not for civilizations mostly but for the way how it all plays out if you lose or win but if you have poured a good 20 hours in one game that isnt that awesome if you lose but my final scores are gameplay 45 from civilizations to choose from 25 ais  meterais bsm 55 based on highest diffcultly playabillity average steam community active yes very altogether i give this game a 710 because i do enjoy this game just please to god make this game more realitic among cultures of the world {recommended}
recommended
sooooo gooood you can honestly spend an obscene amount of time playing this without even realizing it
recommended
civilization 5 is a really addicting turn based strategy game it has been more streamlined than civilization 4 but the elements of managing an empire are still there if you love sinking in hours upon hours into your games civilization 5 will be worth your money the online aspect of this game is also good but i woulndt recommend it for its online features since you can go at your own pace when you are playing by yourself without worrying about finishing the game it is fun to try out the various leaders and it is challenging enough to keep you entertained
recommended
civilization has always been the penulitimate just one more turn game its latest continues that tradition with gusto there is something deeply satisfying about guiding your growing civilization through the course of history the varied victory conditions allows for a multitude of strategies to be effective and fun to pursue and with the latest expansion brave new world these victory conditions are better balanced than ever i can not recomend this game enough but be warned it is all too easy to play just one more turn for hours on end

i have always loved these civ games i am a bit dissappointed that i just spent 20 bucks on brave new world because of the good late game reviews im now in the late portion of the first game ive played since i bought this expansion and the game keeps crashing the content looks appealing but the crashing makes it unusable

recommended
i have played this way way way way way way way way too much but i dont regret a minute of it
recommended
this game is great love it
recommended
do not get this game if you have a short attention span this is a strategy game that requires a lot of thinking planning and time
recommended
the game feels finished and plays well its an improvement over civ 4 in every way save mutliplayer which is awful lacking mod support animated leader heads etc fleshed out multiplayer would be much appreciated
recommended
this is one of the better simulator games out there accurately representing the hundreds of years it takes to build a dirt road ten kilometres long

civ v is the best in the series so far definitely one of my favorite games of all time
recommended
its worse than a plane flight

i was deep in prayer when an angel entered my mind space she was mixedethnicity and looked a little bit like a woman that worked at the local panda express lol @ all of you who think that angels are white god doesnt descriminate against any groups read the bible you shall be the pillar of a new civilization the angel said then she told me her name was lucy lucy furr i didnt know what that meant at the time but coincidentally 6 years later i see that this game is on sale for 75% off so i bought it now im just waiting for a heavenly message to come through this blessed windows 8 
recommended
this is an exceptionally great turn based strategy game i havent played many other games like this but it has encouraged me to i actually hadnt played the other 4 games in the civilization series and i found getting into the game a bit tricky but with the help of some mates and the wiki i managed to love the game i ended up creating a relatively awesome empire only to be crushed by a backstabbing friend so if youre wondering wether to buy this game or not i would recommend you do and buy the dlc brave new world it adds so much and makes it so much better buy it get into the game and start up with your friends
recommended
this is an epic game
recommended
its fun
recommended
bought this on impulse having never played game in this genre before so far i have spent nearly 300 hours plying this awesome game
recommended
just one more turn im with the civ franchiese since civ i back in the 90 this is simply the most beautiful and easy game of the series its like neverending fun with so many different strategies and possibilities you can be sure you wont play the same way twice also many mods cool mods lots of cool mods like new civs or policies or maps or like everything and lots of achievements also poland can into space
recommended
it has consumed my life 1010
recommended
first off this game is very fun when played with friends its still very good with ai though this game is like a time travel machine time goes so fast while playing this game just get this
recommended
possible one of my top games ive ever played
recommended
first things first my experience with sid meier games was virtually nonexistent about a year ago i downloaded xcom enemy unkown for my ps3 and loved it so it made sense to try out civilization v it was highly recommended by some very close friends and i was not disappointed civ v give you the opportunity to lead any of a number of nations throughout history ranging from the ancient era to the information age you are expected to create and maintain cities build your armies crush your enemies spy on your opponents and ensure they do not steal your technology engage in diplomatic relations with other countries and so much more as the game progresses your nation is given access to more advanced technology and your world becomes larger as you explore more of it you can easily lose yourself for hours at a time in this game and that is a great thing this game is among the top in my personal gaming collection it should be in yours too
recommended
this game is great i can sit down and spend hours upon hours on each game highly recommended
recommended
one of my alltime favourite games growing up always seem to come back to it here for the long run 1010
recommended
i first played civ v back in 2010 on windows then i switched over to mac and couldnt bring myself to buy it again especially as the original mac version was just the windows version in a wine type emulator and sucked after they released the osx optimized version in march 2014 i couldnt resist getting it again much better performance now and not as laggy and graphics on an imac 27 at full resolution with high details is not choppy at all but when scrolling fast it does pause to load the tiles onebyone probably because the imac i have only has 1gb of memory not due any limitation of the osx port it does run the gpu hot hot hot and kicks the fans up to max still running it on a late 2012 macbook pro 13 retina got too hot to leave on the lap after half an hour and i could also get the tiles to load onebyone due to the shared memory archetecture an old octacore 2009 mac pro with a radeon 7970 had the pci fans kick in a little higher but not in max airplane turbine mode the tiles dont have to load onebyone as much as the others but it has 3gb of video memory gameplay is still the same addictive turn by turn but the newtome gods and kings  brave new world expansion packs and rebalancing forced a little adjustment my old tactics
recommended
this is an amazing game for anyone looking for a strategically sound empirebuilder great community playability and oodles of fun again and again
recommended
good turn based strategy game it passes time very well
recommended
pretty standard entry into the civilization franchise lots of cool stuff dlc is a bit pricey but its fun to play multiplayer against others religion plays an interesting role in this game the varied methods of winning are also an exciting challenge each in their own way gone is the path of pure domination for the most part this opens up a lot more strategy for the slower paced players unfortunately the standard cap on turns till autoend limits most of the victory conditions from being met by all but the best players
recommended
if youre a fan of strategy games this is the game you should get if you have the money i recommend you buy itmore fun with mods
recommended
you wont go outside 1110
recommended
this is a great game i recommend it for anyone who likes tbs
recommended
ive wasted hours on this game definetly reccomend it
recommended
ive wasted so much time on this game sometimes a whole night devoted and just ended up losingand i loved every minute of it
recommended
although not without its flaws the game that comes closer to perfection than any other
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played you can play it for hours and hours on end
recommended
tremendous game especially with the expansions ive been a civ fan since the original i was initially a civ v skeptic due to what id heard about the new combat model after spending several games with it i have to admit its a real improvement armies matter more because they are relatively rare compared to past civ gamestheyre resources you need to steward carefully as they are expensive to build and you cant stack them the core civ mechanics are intact graphics and sound are superb absolutely a worthy iteration to the series that should make longtime fans happy if youre new to the series this is a great jumpingon point the controls are explained as you go and not hard to learn each turn youre told whats available for you to do or worry about so you dont miss any critical cues even so the game provides a substantial challenge with different difficulty levels and a good online experience
recommended
its going to sap your time like no other <3

ever get tired of being an average joe when youre playing this game youre a godkinggeneral you have the option of creating ever lasting world peaceor a scorched earth
recommended
from the beginning there were several things missing to make civilization 4 the more superior game with all of the added expansions and dlc coming from someone who has wasted thousands of hours on the civilization seriesi much prefer civilization 5 to the others now this is the closest its going to get to managing an empire forging a large group of people the way you want and almost everything about them there is a large learning curve but i assure you if you get past the initial bump you will amass countless and countless amount of hours as i have in to this beautiful game i reccomend this to any one even remotely interested in strategy games or games of the slower nature i do not recomend this to anyone who is impatient by nature
recommended
i dub thee time eater
recommended
i have only had this game for a few weeks and cant get enough of it one more turn
recommended
this game is the best time sink ive ever stumbled upon
recommended
i didnt think i had time for another civ game but then i just stopped sleeping or socializing problem solved
recommended
civ v was my first turnbased strategy game and my first civilization series game and on both counts i couldnt be happier the strategy is compelling and detailed with many options and playstyles available the variety of bonuses and unique units available to each civilization allows for a great deal of replay value and randomized elements in the maps and ais contribute to a fresh start with every game there are some downsides however although one of the biggest draws to civ v is the complex and highly variable strategy options the ai programming leaves much to be desired as an ai simply cannot account for the many different levels of strategy needed to achieve victory as such the difficulty settings feel somewhat lackluster as they simply give the ai greater and greater early advantages leading to a very different gameplay at high levels compared to a truly even playing field combat like with many games is clunky and timeconsuming and although there are elements of strategy and maneuvering it can be boiled down into essentially a numbers game of tech and manpower rather than true strategic prowess multiplayer is also less than ideal particularly in a mixed humanai environment as ai features are severely nerfed or nonexistent in terms of fluff i find the pseudohistorical theme to be a huge benefit as im just enough of a historylinguisticsgeography nerd to find it interesting but not condescending or painfully inaccurate the alternate history line allows for a lot of freedom when of course the game will not reflect a reallife history ultimately though ive sunk many many hours into this game and i can see myself continuing to play well into the future especially considering the price is quite reasonable for comparable game quality and style i would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy history or just having a good time i particularly recommend it as a solo game  for those of us who dont care for online multiplayer civ v is by far the most rewarding singleplayer steam title ive come across
recommended
civilizations 5 is an amazing game i would reccomend this game to everyone it might be hard to start of with but once you know what your doing you will have a lot of fun its also got multiplayer so you can play with friends ive got 67 hours on record of this game and still havent got bored of playing it
recommended
each game can take upwards of 6 to 8 hours but you will remember your empire days weeks even months after you finished the match
recommended
i bought this game recently and already sunk nearly 200 hours into it amazingly well structured sim
recommended
love playing the ruler over people then grab civilization v continues to be a great series of games
recommended
i was gonna go to work but then i played civ 5 1010
recommended
solid game with approachable curve but needs dlc to achieve same levels of depth as previous games
recommended
excellent game kept me and my friends going for hours
recommended
if you like your social life dont get it 10000000000000000000000000010 would lose all my friends again
recommended
y yu no make hotseat multiplayer still a great game tho
recommended
civ v is like most other civ games but with better graphics and more streamlined features if you like any of the civ games you will most certainly enjoy this one
recommended
this is possibly one of the best turn based strategy games ive played and its reallyt easy to get into so you do not have to play the previous civlization games to play civ 5 its 1010 from me
recommended
spent and hour and thirty minutes trying to set up a game with 8 other friends finally clearing the pregame lobby the game crashed for everyone awards awarded best time ive spent in a lobby recognized the true meaning of friendship as we didnt need a game to have fun single player is great tho 1010
recommended
new to civ play civ 5
recommended
civ 5 is the best 4x game ever made better then even the great civ 5 not only does it look great it feels and plays great get the bnw and gk to make it even better who doesent want to be gandhi and take over the world i would also suggest you play it with friends since back stabbing your friends never felt so good i give it a 8510 and a 9510 if you got some of the dlc like bnw and gk
recommended
this game could be one of the the reasons crime rates have gone down while obesity rates go up
recommended
this is addictive fun get it especially during exams
recommended
it is ever so addictive
recommended
great
recommended
as a mind games lover i highly reccomend this game even if you one of the people who dont love looking up for many tutorials and guides to play a game this game briliant once you play it you cant get enought as some one who made more then 10 saves atleast and still every new game is more crazy then the other just the felling from making your first city with one population all the way to a huge empire with an advanced army i highly reccomend this game to everyone no metter what types of game you love actionadventure or any other type this game is fun for everyone
recommended
this game never ends and is very addicting first game set it to random lasted 15hrs totaly worth the buy but id say till it goes on sale so you can buy all the dlc and the game cheaply
recommended
good game would play 1010
recommended
when i first played civ v vanilla i counldnt get into but once i decided to invest into the two expansions gk & bnw im really enjoying it and having an awesome time with it i would definetly recommened getting this along with its expansion to make the experience of playing this more enjoyable and exciting this will go down as one of my fav civ and strategy games of all time
recommended
dont play with friends theyll stab you in the back as soon as you start winning
recommended
anyone who is any kind of strategy player this is a must have with the seemingly limitless mods and ways to play you cant go wrong very easy to sink hundereds of hours into this game without even realizing it this game is a must have for everyone
recommended
with brave new world this game is very good
recommended
great strategy game and worth playing
recommended
fun and addicting
recommended
its like middle school all over again the bullies take your lunch money and your only nerdy friend wins all the chicks in the end
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
great game also it is a great time waster in a good way 
recommended
it is amazing
recommended
totally worth the price tag one of the best strategy games ive played
recommended
civilization v is a great turn based strategy game the music is phenomenal no matter how long i listen to it and ive listened to it for hundreds of hours literally and the atmosphere is amazing 2k games has supported this game for years now releasing content and expansion packs ontop of an already amazing game i especially love 2k games for adding another unit in one of the expansion packs called the xcom squad directly from their other game xcom enemy unknown also a great game as further incentive the steam workshop allows you to conveniently download custom mods to further your enjoyability of this great game if you think turn based games arent for you and that you prefer rtss or dont even enjoy strategy games at all i beg you to pick this up i didnt even find strategy games all that great until i picked this up and now they are a reoccurring theme in my steam library play this game and you might be hooked for life like me
recommended
when i was young i couldnt really get into turn based strategy because it felt like it took forever to do anything fun as the civ series has progressed theyve made it not only easier for newbies to get into theyve also made the pacing very flexible allowing you to play at whatever speed you prefer still turnbased of course this game is a brilliant way to spend a few hoursdaysweeks be warned when you start a game you will experience the time travel effect
recommended
ill just play for an hour look at the clock twelve hours have passed youve missed work and for the last thirty turns youve been telling yourself one more turn and then ill go to the bathroom
recommended
10  10 i have to say watching reviews gameplay videos and trailers heck even watching a friend of mine play it i didnt think it was that good especially being a veteran of total war shogun 2 i figured the battles were way too basic and would drag the whole game down well i was wrong this is one of those games that has a ton of customization options to fit any type of play short long easy hard its a game that you literally will keep saying one more turn so very addicting and even more so if you play with friends for a game with 6 or 12 players online and 6 player offline hotseat coop fully supported on a single machine this game is one of the best games ive ever played and ive played games since atari 2600 i highly recommend this to any strategy or micromanage gamer the feature set is so strong and this game just completely sucks you in my only regret was not getting it a year sooner when it was on sale for the same price
recommended
wow what can i say about this game first its so addictive you lose track of time i would advise getting the dlc gods & kings and brave new world because this is what makes the game and it has great replay value 910
recommended
this game is great this is for anyone looking for that good turn based stratagy game i am a huge fan of the series and the ai on this game are intelligent they will attack if they see weakness so you are constantly on your toes
recommended
one of the best strategy games on the market if you have alll day to kill or just a few hours it can be a lot of fun
recommended
good old civ
recommended
the fluidity and addictive nature of this game really made me feel comfortable as a first time strategy game player a must buy unless you value your social life
recommended
one of the best turn based strategy games remember not only war strategy fun to play expecially with friends but a word of warning really heavy on the processor in the late game atleast on mp hybrid mode my advice use standard turns in mp too helps a bit so if you like turn based strategy were you dont have to kill everybody play this brave new world makes it lot better 
recommended
this is simply a master piece with unlimited replay value and outstanding complexity this game could just be the end of all other games
recommended
i enjoy this game very much sadly it makes the hours fly by without notice multiple ways to win with diversification on the races plenty to try with great replayability
recommended
great game with unlimited potential easy installation on mods and i got the gold edition gnk for only 15 dollars
recommended
an amazing game the expansions make this game greater but the base game works just fine when getting this game realise games take a long time to complete overall great way to waste time 1010
recommended
a lot like cory in the house
recommended
the best game the olny game
recommended
great game
recommended
great strategy game if you like turn based games that allows you the choice between different victory types more fun when played against human players as opposed to the ai in my opinion as the predictability is much lower but there are a large number of options and player mods to help change the game up if it starts to feel a bit stale a really good pick up if you can catch it in a sale for around 5  10
recommended
its fun what more do you want
recommended
amazing game never ceases to show me new ways to play just watch who you play with if one of your friends seem like a power hungry violent  dont play with them
recommended
this game is beast
recommended
this game is amazing complex at first the game has a good tutorial that explains the main concepts the game has lots of layers and multiple ways to win either through science culture and diplomacy or war and domination this enables you to not always crush everyone but to be diplomatic or be more culturalscientific your social policies can give you edges in certain areas of your civilization and often one thing is connected to another more science research means better army which leads to more diplomatic power and so on only negatives are that sometimes the worker automation does not work and that one game can take days to finish multiple characters and dlc enable endless replayability without the game becoming boring overall a great game
recommended
yes much fun wow would play much cheap
recommended
i suppose i should write a review for the game ive put the most hours into i am writing this after the release of both expansions for the people with civ iv vs v debates i can understand why people disliked civ v over iv at first the civ series has gradually improved itself to civ iv and then civ v is a total overhaul of the game a hex grid board instead of squares one military unit per tile no more stacks of doom and a simplification of the ui all of these things are a blessing with the exception of the ai doesnt really know how to control its military properly it has been noticablely improved though also civ v vanilla didnt have religion or espionage so why move on to civ v imo civ v is better than iv after gods & kings and definitely better after brave new world thanks to the one unit per hex system civ v feels more like a wargame than the ones before it and i like the change for how religion is used in v better than iv which was really just a research rush for the tech that unlocked that religion the best part about the bnw expansion is that the peaceful victories have become just as fun throughout the legnth of the game as conquest the cultural victory used to just be to get your culture buildings up quick beeline radio and sit there and hit end turn until you win now you can go to war and steal great works of art from a rival civ send in archaeologists to take artifacts out of their lands and send in great musicians to tourism bomb them in the hopes of influencing their citizens to your culture this game is endlessly replayable even if you play on a preset map like earth the actions taken by other civs is always unpredicable basically what it comes down to is i love this game i would recommend it to anybody but i guess if youre the impatient type then you might not like it my arguement to that would be every turn in this game has something important happen except maybe the first few and that is why my hours are over 500 at the time of this writing it is addicting to watch your mud hut village with spearmen grow into an empire of gleaming metropolises that is capable of launching nukes even when you finish the game it gives you the option for one more turn
recommended
washington should have conquered the world irl
recommended
it is possible that you disliked vainilla civ5 but trust me on this after 2 expansions the game has become a truly masterpiece
recommended
holy crap this is awesome
recommended
this game is great and is fun to play with friends
recommended
expertly balances the grand majesty of human accomplishment with the cartoonish evil of nuking mahatma ghandi into the stone age
recommended
great game
recommended
i like the game very much is realistic and enjoyable 9510

recommended

recommended
this game is very addicting i have played many times and i still feel that i have not done everything there is to do on this game if you like to think and plan this is the game for you
recommended
great turn based strategy game
recommended
this game is a bit hard to master but once you get into it you can spend hours having fun pillaging trading exploring or doing whatever i strongly reccomend this game and ill give it a solid 9510 also also also buy gods and kings and the other dlcs adds alot of fun content
recommended
i love this game it has an awesome soundtrack great mod support and really addicting gameplay
recommended
it is a great way to spend your hours of uselessness
recommended
a fresh next gen take on the classic that shaped pc gaming on earth this is a beast of a game no single human born after the 90s can say it never heard of sid miers civ game to review this i would need some 2 history books and a couple of pages
recommended
its an awsome strategy game if you ask me
recommended
this game is rather exquisite it inspires me to raise an army and conquer the world with brute force thank you for your time

not as good as civ iv but civ iv is one of the worlds best tactic games and not many games are better than it civilization v is something new and special there are new buildings soldiers and diplomatic possibilities when youve played it for some hours you know how it works and you can use the many different tools to become the biggest civilization ever
recommended
a great statergy game and througly addictive
recommended
great game for the rts user
recommended
civ v is a good game if your into strategy and all that
recommended
its good but this game will just eat up all of your time
recommended
combat is better than iv but everything else is a little less fun from what i understand bnw really makes this the game it is supposed to be it is still a great game though
recommended
how many hours have i lost what year is it why is my underwear solid these are all questions i ask myself when i finish playing a game of civ 5 and all of it is worth the pain of 100 asleep buttocks seriously though this game is great and worth every penny you could pick up and through at it
recommended
ive logged almost 500 hours in this game best civ so far
recommended
one of the most addicting games ever
recommended
im not a huge strategy player but this one hooked me i cannot reccommend this game if you plan on doing anything with your life other than playing it the hours vanish when you start it up
recommended
basicly its like paper please but its not 1010 paper please is good game
recommended
sid meiers civilzation v is one of the best stratagy games i have ever seen and i am not the only one who thinks that mulitple players and ign said the same thing civ v is a turned based game where you try to conquer your entire map but if that seems too hard you can either be the first to space have 5 diplomacies research everything or have the most points when 2050 comes around you play one of many famous conquers in history and try to build a civilization that will stand the test of time if you dont want to do this alone you dont have to you can make helpful citystate random civilization become your ally and they will reward you by sending you gifts of gold resources or even army units if that is not what you thought i meant by not alone dont worry you can play with other people and take down or befriend their civilzation fiddlesticks 910 review
recommended
do i recommend this game hell yes this is one of the greatest games i have played and playing it with friends is even more fun you can choose from many civilizations from the aztecs to russia and almost anyone else you can think of so in total yes i would reccoment this game to anyone and everyone
recommended
civilization has ruined and continues to ruin my life would recommend
recommended
one more turn am i right lol
recommended
ciiv 5 is a great game for those who wish to become a warmongering menace to the rest of the world fight your enemies sack their cities and enslave their population ahem i mean ask them nicely to join youin the name of peace of course nah just kidding rampage through their territory and when they ask for peace extend to them the warm glow brought only by a nuclear missile remember kids my words are backed by nuclear weapons im warlord gandhi and i approve this message
recommended
certainly a fun game it is fabulous to declare war with everyone on the first turn and win the game add some friends into the mix for more awesome i would not recommend this game to someone who is not patient games take upwards of 3 hours to complete on average
recommended
i purchased this game for me and a friend we went on multiplayer and it was feckin awesome this game will never get old and can be played over and over again for endless hours of fun
recommended
dont trust ghandi
recommended
i highly recommend this game the graphics are awesome and the gameplay is so open that you can run any civ how you want although some strategies are more effective than others with certain factions the game allows for so much variation between individual games and you will never play the same match twice because of random starting points and different civs that you face
recommended
what can i say pew pew lets go to war or not your choice
recommended
ing caesaralways there to  thing upfor  sake i just trespass your land once
recommended
its good
recommended
only get if you like turnbased strategy games that can make hours disappear from your day
recommended
i have not played many hours of civ 5 but i would like to give my intial thoughts and views on this game i would like to start by comparing this game to a board game think catan with a little bit of risk moved in now that you can view it as this now add in a little of age of empires this is a turned based version of these gamesboard games are usually turned based the atmosphere is great and the initail game i played had me stuck for 6 hours straight this game is very good as it keeps you stuck in for the long haul the objectives in the game are great as there is more than one way to win you can build a giant army and march across the battlefeild crushing your enemys going the cultural root and increasing your artistic side of the city this gives the game varity and replayability the diffrent racesworld leaders you can choose from also gives the game a great uniqueness that allows for hours of gameplay there is no story there is just advance you civilisation 5 to the best point by researching diffrent things and building unique buildings from throughout history there is a multiplayer that i have not yet delved into i believe the multiplayer would increase the game time by at least another 23 hours i have an estimation that each game on normal of about 68 hours this game takes some thinking and a few of the actions take a while to figure out this game is very good at explaining what you have to do to learn how to play from what i have played so far i would say this is a very great game and has given me the longest single sitting in anygame i have played in for a very very long time well worth a look at the time of this review the game and the dlc is avalible on humblebundlecom for $15 as well as some other games
recommended
the best strategy game i have ever encountered
recommended
awesome game can turn some the coolest civilizations upside down like native americans building the pyrimids
recommended
ok i must say i am hooked this game has interesting gameplay and every single round you play is different i did not take the tutorial facepalm but because of the advisors i really didnt have to i learned how to play the game by playing it the only downside i have with this game is the length of time it takes to play a full game my first victory took me 700 moves and over 8 hours of play to win also it is the game of publicly denouncing no matter what you do you will get denounced become friends with a city state someone else is friends with denounced take over 1 city state denounced look at someone the wrong way denounced overall a fun game overall this game gets an 1110 from me oh and 1 more thing julius caesar is one greedy dude watch out
recommended
fantastic game gave me a very bad case of onemoreturnitis
recommended
literally the best gaming experience for those with any appreciation for history this game gives you the ability to rewrite the history of a new world possesing an industrious nation stateclassical empire of your choice you have the ability to persue a victory in cultural supremacy scientific achievement diplomatic popularity raw conquest or a tally of points at the end of the year 2050 ad every civilizations unique abilities units buildings or tile improvements correlate accurately to history and the way that civilization gained power in our world usually ends up its strong suit in the alternate multiverse created with each game of civilization 5 1010 by far worth anyones time
recommended
great turned based strategy good fun with multiplayer  but expect a chess like game rather than full on action very addictive and replayable
recommended
speaking from the perspective of someone whos never played the earlier civilization games here the stories about civ 5 being a great time sink are incredibly true but i find myself somewhat hard pressed to start up a new game after sinking a lot of time into my first game just dont expect to be able to please everybody and dont expect to be able to do all there is to do in a single campaign and you should do just fine
recommended
>implying that grinding every other civilization off the face of the earth then salting their lands as you suppress riots and famines in your homeland with armor rolling off the lines and pollution choking the skies isnt the best way to win every game
recommended
this is possibly one the best games ive ever played in my life the modding community is brillaint and ive spent more than 339 hours playing it do i recommend it hell yeah
recommended
i love this game so addictive so real
recommended
just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn just one more turn
recommended
civilization has been one of my favourite games since 1994 ive spent hundreds of hours with civilization 1 which for me was much better than sequels i never quite liked the way 2 3 or 4 were made but 5 is different and for me its a worthy successor of civ1 with god&kings and a brave new world expansions its tons of fun to play
recommended
its fun but has a ton of achievements and long games i suggest a guick game which can be chosen in set up game the first difficulty is really easy and i suggest starting on a higher difficulty like 3
recommended
civ has got to be one of the best strategy games ive ever tried turnbased and played on a hexagonal field a bit like a board game but the special rules in civ make you think twice before doing anything one part of the game that i love is how you get to control every little aspect of your civ from research and military to social policies communism and construction another great thing is that there is a big selection of different civs each with their own unique units andor buildings and traits from across time to choose from such as 18th century america 1st century rome 9th century denmark and many more with another chunk being added with the gods and kings expac such as 17th century sweden also has a fcking great soundtrack my conclusion if you are into other turnbased strategy games such as total war but want en exciting twist try civilization 5
recommended
great game full of fun 910
recommended
great strategy game
recommended
great game one that can always be replayed and doesnt get repetetive some aspects of the game are infuriating at points but once you get past them the game reaches a point of unparalleled enjoyment
recommended
this is the best game the only game
recommended
very fun game if you like strategy games dont trust anyone haha
recommended
a game that lasts long
recommended
its pretty fantastic
recommended
a very good game with the dlcs
recommended
very amazing game though falls a bit short against civ 4
recommended
ill just play a quick game  said no one ever
recommended
i have been playing this series since civ 1 back in on my amiga 5oo days in the early 90s and if you are into worldciv building strategy titles in any way shape or form games just wont come better than this masterpiece it is immensely fun totally addictive and returns great value for your money worth noting is that i have exclusively played vanilla with the exceptance of purchased official dlc single player vs ai for civ 5 ie no mp at all  but judging by previous experiences from earlier titles in the series i dare guess that mp is even more fun and challenging add to this the plethora of user created mods via steamworks and you have an almost endless source of digitalized entertainment  this comes highly recommended as a game with the almost perfect mix of theme ambience game mechanics and outright addictive fun
recommended
this game is completely addicting  i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys rts games of any kind it just reels you in keeps you going and makes you not want to stop for anything
recommended
very fun and addicting to play with friends
recommended
this game is a game a good game
recommended
its really quite a fun game you can choose whether to make it fast games or epic long games plus the modding community seems pretty large
recommended
if youve ever wanted to be ghandi build the great wall of china in the middle of africa or blow the  out of george washington with a nuclear bomb you should play this game
recommended
the amount of content available in this game is ing insane the addiction factor is up there with the best games out there and it never feels like a chore best casual strategy game out there up to this date 1010
recommended
sid meiers civilization v never ceases to amaze me with its content with the sheer variety of customization options every single game is different there are so many ways to play as essentially any past civilization you could imagine that it is surely my favorite game of all time
recommended
the latest instalment in the civilization series number five sees the biggest changes in the established format the game is based on an entirely new game engine with hexagonal tiles instead of the square tiles of earlier games the combat system has been overhauled removing stacking of military units and enabling cities to defend themselves by firing directly on nearby enemies computer controlled citystates are a new feature which allows you to befriend and trade with if the neighbouring ai is not offering trade due to them panicking over your troop build up on yours and their border the dlc  gods and kings adds religion and espionage features that were already in civilization iv but strangely left out of the base civ v game coming from previous civilizations takes a little getting used to but overall this is a solid outing 8 and half out of 10 kiwifruit
recommended
awesome but takes a long time to load
recommended
just like in real life people in this game hate me for no disernable reason 9th grade all over again except throwing spears instead acusations and supicions about my sexual oriantation 1010 great low self esteem simulator
recommended
great game 1010
recommended
omg yes strategy fan you will love this game ok its a different take than the fast paced age of empires or the bazing fast starcraft but even though the combat is not challenging you do need to think your movements through before executing or youll find yourself in a pesky situation its fun that its historyoriented but its kinda irrelevant in my opinion you just have to know what kind of buffs you get from each civ and pick your victory route the ai tends to not be quite friendly but that keeps things interesting if you cant find people to play with and lets face it the games are loooong so its rather hard to coordinate with other humans p great game
recommended
youll easily get a few dozen hours of playtime out of this if you like strategy games definitely recommend it
recommended
great game worth money
recommended
i believe with enough friends an online match would be amazing
recommended
who needs drugs when civ v will make you feel like an addict for alot cheaper
recommended
really cool game worth the money get it if you like intense strategy
recommended
i love this game i just wish its gold edition came with all the dlcs
recommended
cool game
recommended
this is one of the best games ever

recommended
i gave horses to rome and died
recommended
this stuff is good i like this stuff
recommended
cool game but enemy calculations take a little long thus it gets lenghy if u play with lot of ai  the difficulty settings seem a bit easy
recommended
online games get kicked and dont last but otherwise it is good game for sure
recommended
a very addicting strategy game very fun in singleplayer as well as multiplayer definitely a great game for anybody who has a bit of time on their hands 
recommended
great game lots of fun and very addictive expect a massive drop in your productivity from the moment youve first booted the game
recommended
this is game for people which loved ruled the world
recommended
perfect for the war mongering menace within us
recommended
this game is awesome  cause its the only game that i can torture and enslave people in order toi make ing armies and factories and  everyone cause my town is military based  ing epic with tankes and  and viking berserkers  im steve the deamon and i approve this message 
recommended
who needs to waste their time on real life things when you can become the king of the ing planet
recommended
this game is a time machine be careful on multiple occasions while playing i was flung several hours forward in time but perceived none of it its like those stories people tell you about having missing hours in their life driving home from work and all of a sudden youre home and cant remember anyhitng at all about the trip back they could have sworn the just turned the key and now theyre in their driveway yeah same thing here i start the game at 9pm i make like 4 moves and its 4am all of sudden s crazy man

i am the peaceful nation of the celts we shall be the nation of religion and of diplomacy this went well we ended up next to the babylonians and we expanded nicely in peace however i have always believed in dibs so i placed down glasgow onto the land between us to provide a little buffer they seemed annoyed by this a few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years but otherwise nothing too bad happened in order to spread our religion further because we were known for our confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster we begin to invest in boats soon we covered the oceans in missionaries inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies babylon was making friends with a local city state genoa however they were trying to spread zoroastrianism those heathens despite both our religions being known for their peace we passiveaggressively sent missionary and inquisitor to genoa over the course of about 700 years we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions those same warriors had been given spears now but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders i offer babylon some sugar for their spice they wanted my sugar iron coal and all of my money i then asked germany if they wanted sugar for spice they accepted north of me rome had begun a war with france due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade i found myself with a huge amount of money everytime france and rome made peace i knew that rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes so i bought i gifted many city states my religion and gold and then i bought gifted france and germany enough money to declare with with rome while they fought my spearmen now musketmen continued to glare with babylons and we continued our 1500 year religious passiveaggression over genoa they said i was spying on them i said i wouldnt when my spies returned i sent them back to babylon a squad of 5 great prophets charged into babylon converting left right and centre babylon complained i was being a bit aggressive i apologised i then sent more missionaries to babylon i had now found every single civilization we decided to have a united nations meeting in 1600ad i as the host gave everyone a single vote except myself i gave myself 16 due to my popularity i declared my religion to be the world religion every one opposed i listened to their opinions and then passed it anyway when rome got angry about this i then paid france to declare war again when babylon got angry i then paid rome to declare war on them my civilians were amazingly happy hugely more than any other place but because i was an emperor they declared me declis the terrible despite my universal healthcare happy citizens peaceful religion not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word my army consisted of mostly my friends my city states and my musketmen now great war infantry continued to glare at the babylonian great war infantry after 2000 years a great duty to my nation their descendants shall continue to frown at the babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall eventually we reached a grand united nations meeting i sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 city state friends and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side i said that the peoples confucian republican empire of scotland was the best nation in the world they all voted against me i smiled and then declared i won anyway democracy is overrated freedom of religion only applies to my religion i dont need to be stronger when im more popular and my people are probably more beautiful and if you dont like me ill pay your best friend to backstab you through this i came to understand american foreign policy so civilization is if nothing else an educational tool

love this game to pieces only reason i havent played it more is because i got a new computer and i cant be bothered to install it 
recommended
this is one of my all time favorite games however please observe this warning this game is like crack if you have something you have to do in the next couple hours like sleep work take care of a child really anything that requires you to have some track of what time it is do not start a game personal example and reason im in the dog house came home after work around 10pm kissed the wife ate dinner decide to play a little civ v around 1030pm wife went to bed i started playing lost track of time and became extremely engrossed in the game the progression of my civilization which technology i should research next ghandi just nuked me so now i must exact revenge ghandi is gone now who is next on my list next thing i know my wife comes in the room and says are you really still playing the kid will be awake in 2 hours and you have to go to work in 6 hours what the hell is wrong with you my first reaction was there is no way ive been playing for 7 hours i checked the time and sure enough it had gotten way out of hand just remember to keep a clock somewhere nearby and within view if you are planning on playing this game

civilization v is a very slow paced game that can take days to complete singleplayer is one of the most boring experiences i have had in a game grab a few friends to play with and this is a solid 810 very few glitches i found and tons of replayability for those casual gamers out there this is the way to go building your empire or knocking others down this is the best empire building game out there solo rating 410 multiplayer rating 810
recommended
the most accessible grand strategy out right now
recommended
i found civ5 much like i did the others in the series once i got the expansion packs the experience became so much better this game is nothing short of addictive

recommended
honestly if you are fan of stategy games civ 5 is for you bots can actually be a challenge sometimes but by far the most enjoyable way to play civ is with friends a huge selection of civilizations to choose from all with their own perks and specials game mechanics make sense to the idea of the game  to lead a civilization throughout history better yet like many steam games the workshop for this game is great makes it just that much more replayable
recommended
best gandhi nuking simulator out at the moment  can nuke the gandhi  addicting  gandhi can nuke you
recommended
excellent strategy game for beginners and veterans alike eight difficulty levels allow players to finetune their difficulty levels and user created mapsciv packages allow for ridiculous replayability excellent community on the web for single player and multiplayer dlc is reasonably priced and goes on sale often firaxis could patch balance issues a little more frequently but its still pretty balanced for the most part
recommended
the game itself is amazing you add the expansions which add even more content it just makes a great time killer while having fun at the same time
recommended
ghandi is a mass murderer in civ 5 a game in which you sit around for 30 turns to make a single building its a fun game but even on the fastest setting makes casual a thing of the past watch your armies crumble to shreds your villages pillaged and destroyed and learn to hate everyone around you today in civilization 5
recommended
nothing beats taking over the world

hey you yeah you dont sit there all like i dont really like strategy games because you havent played this beast of a ing game you could literally forget about your real boring life and become muthaing queen elizabeth and go  up greece if you want to we all know caesar was secrectly gay right or what about that ghengis khan  who the  does he think he is right right go  him up then and stop wasting time go go forth
recommended
so much customisation and units to choose from different eras and leaders  different game lengths and different maps epic game overall

you see tanks have a preset kill limit knowing their weakness i sent wave after wave of my own men at them until they reached their limit and shut down
recommended
this game is awesome time and space with vanish
recommended
perhaps the best rts ive ever played and ive played a heck of a lot of em there is no end to the playability that is presented in civ v the game is beautiful as well as challenging and will provide many many many hours of gameplay there are an almost absurd number of factions to choose from all of them with their own specialties that utilize different playstyles as well as multiple ways to win games granting almost endless replayability perhaps one game youd play as japan and establish an autocratic government who will win by global domination perhaps another time youll take a shot as america and create democracy winning the game by becoming the democratic world leader but if youre feeling really kooky why not play as the spartans establish a scientific society and master space flight regardless of how crazy you want it you can probably do it its all up to you ever since alpha centauri for the ye olde pc i have always enjoyed a good sid meiers game because there are no other games like these that are as intriquate difficult interesting or fun this game just works where so many others end up being clunky and poorly designed if youre into rts games want to experience something incredible and you have the patience to endure games that can last multiple hours pick this up you wont regret it at all i wont however suggest this to people with a short attention span andor a lack of patience you wont enjoy it
recommended
best strategy game very intense and can get addicting
recommended
a very addictive game countless hours of replayability the gods & kings as well as brave new world expansion packs add so much good stuff it is strange that some people dont have this game yet as you can see from the amount of hours played you will not be disappointed when you buy it only gripe is that if you play with friends against the cpu in multiplayer the ai is very stale furthermore mods are not enabled for multiplayer although they are for single player though and irecommend the european and world maps made by the community with true placement buy it and prepare for hours and hours of fun gameplay
recommended
manages to be be both easy to pick up and incredibly tough to fully master which is quite an achievement it walks the newcomer through the basics of the game before leaving them to work out how to improve and build from there
recommended
it isssss ammmmmmaaaazzzzzziiiinnngggg game could play for hours
recommended
one of the best game in the strategy genre and anyone can just pickup and play but only true masters will be good at it you will not be able to do anything else after starting a game so make lots of time d

incredibly addictive game that i never thought i would get into definately worth trying

considering this is a turn based game rather than a shooter it is ridiculously addictive ive owned each release from civ 1 onward and have enjoyed them all if you dont like the relatively slow start then use a small map and begin in the modern or future eras this is a really good alternative to shooters if youre willing to think and plan connive and weasel
recommended
wow is what i said after i finally beat this game this game makes you start off with nothing aand lets you create step by step and at the start peaceful times none around at the end your warriors have to fight off 2 or 3 civs just to survive and you can make freindships but in this you cant trust your allies they turn on you any chance they get annd number one rule dont trust washington the ottomans or spain

this game is pretty fun the interface takes a bit to get used to the game is incredibly addictive though the perpetual cycles make it hard to walk away from and therefore i ended up playing through an entire civ often much to the detriment of my work

civivilization 5 continues to improve upon this amazing franchise in small and wonderful ways the addition of the policy trees is one of my favorite because it allows more control over the way your empire grows and gives your civ more personality than it could have in previous games diplomacy combat and the tech trees have all seen improvements as well as a significant upgrade in graphics quality the two large expansions for this game gods & kings and brave new world also add a huge amounts of complexity and depth to the game that was lacking in the former titles
recommended
awesome game i play it way to much
recommended
its awesome if you get it message me and i will play with you

started from the bottom now im here get the  away from me you mothering queer actually the game is quite fun and its a lot of fun to start from nothing and then take over other civilizations only to be denounced and called a liar and a betrayer but all is worth when you win the game

this fifth installment really brings my previous civ gaming experiences to the next level  as a history and a book lover civilization 5 brings me to the days of old when nations are still small wars are constant where seeds technological development are still being planted and watered for growth wonders are being constructed etc this game gives users the best perspective of seeing how the nations of the world evolve and continues to evolve until now nice gameplay superb detail and graphics plus the accuracy of ai leader personalities based on history really gives you that great feeling leading your chosen civilization to glory the different systems in the game the religion and espionage in gods and kings adds depth to gameplay it gives the player multiple ways to achieve victory for a civ i just love this game so much

this game im not usually the type to enjoy a game like this im more into arma and the such but picking this up in the sale was a genious idea everything looks so crisp and clean a little hard to get used to at first but thanks to the tutorial after a game or two youll pick up everything you need to know this game is made even better if you have friends to play it with too as thanks to the steam cloud saving you can load up your saved game with your friend anytime and stop playing whenever you like

this game is a turn based strategy title based on actual history it makes learning history fun as you take control of countries as far back as the ancient era and rule them in your own way
recommended
its a really cool game if you like strategy games this is a really fun strategy game that has action but also takes a ton of thought one downside is it takes probably 12 hours minimum for each game

ive had the base game a long while now and the expansions just make it better this game will never grow old for me

if your into strategy games and you havent played civ yet your missing out it is a fun game to play solo but even funner with friends i strongly recommend this game and suggest you to get the gold pack so you get most of the dlc

very addicting game albeit historically inaccurate the engaging gameplay makes up for ghandis rampant expansionalism
recommended
firaxis latest installment to civilization series although i recommend quite late civilization take the already glorifying series to upper heigh  with some gameplay rehaul and enhancement and introduction of some new nation even siam xd  engage in all new diplomacy and technology rehaul improved ai graphic newly introduced victory type diplomatic victory along with the older type such as good ol cultural technological and domination victory the game also see a great modding community that allow you to load and enhance the game without a single dime  also new dlc pack god and king seen some new nation such as netherland and celtic religion now also play role in your national strife to glory 
recommended
this game will ruin your life but buy it but it will seriously ruin your life

recommended
civilization v is one of those few games that is enjoyable whether youre playing alone with friends with people you dont know or even passing it around with people at your house its just a fun game the amount of different scenarios that can happen is infinite and as you progress you have this feeling of being a world leader which is very satisfying and is something i have never seen delivered successfully in a game you can be what you want whether it be a nuclear warlord or a peaceseeking nation the game is always fun you can choose to start at the beginning of civilization and a huge selection of different iconic eras such as the medieval renessance ancient etc or you can even start in modern times or in the future to come every game you play lays down new options of how you want to go about doing things keeping it fresh and fun a great investment

recommended
big fan of the game very addictive you spend most of your time going just one turn more
recommended
ive put 300 hours into this game and thats more than i put into relationships haha ill be here all week people
recommended
civilization v is a wonderful game and experience to be had not only do you learn a little bit about real world information about various civilization leaders but the game itself is also quite enjoyable the game is also highly addictive and can become a major timesink this expansion dlc adds quite a lot of new touches enhancing the game so much more than the original standalone game if you can afford it or have the patience to wait for the next steam sale or holiday sale i would strongly recommend civilization gold which gets you the game and the two expansion downloadable content for gods and kings and brave new world sometimes the game can feel a bit slow so those that have more patience would likely enjoy this game as with anything i would recommend checking trailers some gameplay on youtube and so on to potentially entice you giving you a better informed decision to pick it up for yourself or not i hereby give my recommendation to this game
recommended
very interesting and informative game your brains will level up with this game i recommend it 3
recommended
civ v is the closest thing we currently have to stasis sleep i started this game up and suddenly two days were gone over 29 hours gone from my life this game could really take out all the tedium of intergalactic space travel a more appropriate analogy may compare civ v to a highly addictive drug but id like to make it perfectly clear that i love this game even if it tears my family apart i seriously wish i didnt come into work this morning im jonesing so hard
recommended
one of the best strategy games ive played immensely time consuming but great fun 1010

recommended
civ v is probably the best looking and most enjoyable game in the civilization series plus major updates to gameplay every few months very worth it buy it
recommended
civilization 5 is a great entry in the series and a good one for beginners to start with since it has the designflaws of civilization revolution not as good as civilization 3 or 4 but its prettier and works better online than both of them so it gets the job done the expansionpacks cure what the vanillaversion lacked so make sure to get those right away otherwise you wont enjoy the game and even if you do you miss out on a lot of content tldr the game is bland if played vanilla with expansion  dlc the game is great
recommended
so addictive sooooo addictive
recommended
spectacularly good game definately one to pick up with friends and play when you get bored of repetetive fps i would recomend also getting the brave new world dlc aswell
recommended
though ive never really enjoyed strategy games sid meiers civilization v has definately been an enjoyable game to play though things arent always historically correct cough cough america in the ancient era its still fun trying to outlast the ai or the barbarians overall this is one of the best games ive played so far if you have the money get it
recommended
really this is a yes and no recomendation i like the new map setup and no unit stacking but its too simplified and sure dlcs fix that but that is $60 usd for both
recommended
a tremendous strategy game that evolves and changes as time progresses and features many ways to expand your empire its even more fun with the expansions
recommended
this game has on several occasions left me playing until the break of dawn unintentionally that is a rare feat make sure you get gods & kings as well as brave new world for the complete civ v experience
recommended
perfect for the war mongering menace within us
recommended
this game is awesome  cause its the only game that i can torture and enslave people in order toi make ing armies and factories and  everyone cause my town is military based  ing epic with tankes and  and viking berserkers  im steve the deamon and i approve this message

who needs to waste their time on real life things when you can become the king of the ing planet

this game is a time machine be careful on multiple occasions while playing i was flung several hours forward in time but perceived none of it its like those stories people tell you about having missing hours in their life driving home from work and all of a sudden youre home and cant remember anyhitng at all about the trip back they could have sworn the just turned the key and now theyre in their driveway yeah same thing here i start the game at 9pm i make like 4 moves and its 4am all of sudden s crazy man
recommended
a suprisingly good game one of the best i have played in a very long time

siv v a very good game indeed but needing some improvents including some new characters like stalin and hitler because when i get home after a hard day of work i like to recreate the genocides that happened in the 193040s it brings a tear to my heart of happiness when i see it being done this game is great for almost everyone that likes to think 1% of the us population 1 final problem with the game is that when you are allys with a citystate or ruler not once can you ask friendly troops if they want to have sex with other troops very prejudice against homosexuals i see anyway would recommend to most folks 6969
recommended
ive played this series from civ2 onwards and i continue to be amazed with the depth of gameplay be warned that this is is one of those  just one more turn games and will keep you up late at night
recommended
1010 would buy again

this is most likely a game

[quick infomation] im completely new to the civilization v series but this title is one you should consider picking up the game is about you taking control of a civilization for example china you can choose to start in the ancient age all up til the information age you can also choose to spawn in the real world or a random map or just build a map [gameplay] the gameplay is turnbased you do what ever you want to do in a turn press next turn and the ai or if multiplayer a human does what ever they want you can choose different kinds of game speeds quick standard epic & marathon the difference between the game speeds is how long research production & grow takes but movement of units isnt slowed the maps is made of hexs it opens up for lots of tactical opportunities [gameplay time] if you start from the ancient era and with quick speed you can easily expect a few hours unless you rush your enemies a marathon can take multiple days but over the course of multiple days you can get tired with your civilization so i do not recommend playing at this speed i normally take epic to have a acceptable science speed and so i have time to explore in a good time but marathon is just to boring since there isnt much to do while you wait for the cities to finish production in the course of 2 weeks ive already played around 100 hours only a few games can keep my attention so strong and im still playing [community] the game features mod support the mods are in the main menu just click on the and connect to steam workshop and there are already many mods for you to use even more time on the game [multiplayer] the multiplayer is not tagged on it has a great multiplayer it is pretty much just like singleplayer but just with humans but the turns takes some time late game you can actually turn something called pitboss on this will do so that every time its your turn in multiplayer it can either email you or send you a steam invite while you do other stuff but i like the single player more since there isnt that waiting time but one quite annoying thing that cant really be fixed is that there will allways be a good one in a game if you are the good one it will really decrease the other players morale if they have a bad time they will proberly quit or just be kind of sadmad at you friends so this game is best at its single player [final score] 910
recommended
this game is great
recommended
time flies in this game i need to buy diapers to conquer the world
recommended
urmurgurd this game is the tankiest tank of all tankdom if you have friends get them to get it if they dont they are not your friends if they get it the fun will never end
recommended
great game for the rts user
recommended
civ v is a good game if your into strategy and all that
recommended
its good but this game will just eat up all of your time
recommended
combat is better than iv but everything else is a little less fun from what i understand bnw really makes this the game it is supposed to be it is still a great game though
recommended
how many hours have i lost what year is it why is my underwear solid these are all questions i ask myself when i finish playing a game of civ 5 and all of it is worth the pain of 100 asleep buttocks seriously though this game is great and worth every penny you could pick up and through at it
recommended
ive logged almost 500 hours in this game best civ so far
recommended
one of the most addicting games ever
recommended
im not a huge strategy player but this one hooked me i cannot reccommend this game if you plan on doing anything with your life other than playing it the hours vanish when you start it up
recommended
basicly its like paper please but its not 1010 paper please is good game
recommended
immersive fun easy to pick up but hard to master really should not miss out on any sid meier games especially not civ
recommended
just  another  turn  ^^

ressearched internet before computers 90001337

recommended
great
recommended
as a mind games lover i highly reccomend this game even if you one of the people who dont love looking up for many tutorials and guides to play a game this game briliant once you play it you cant get enought as some one who made more then 10 saves atleast and still every new game is more crazy then the other just the felling from making your first city with one population all the way to a huge empire with an advanced army i highly reccomend this game to everyone no metter what types of game you love actionadventure or any other type this game is fun for everyone
recommended
this game never ends and is very addicting first game set it to random lasted 15hrs totaly worth the buy but id say till it goes on sale so you can buy all the dlc and the game cheaply
recommended
good game would play 1010
recommended
it was once said that man can be entertained for hours on end with the simple image of boobs while this is true man gains nothing from this other than an erection dirty tissues and a hard to explain smell on his  purchasing this game is not only a visual pleasure for your brain it helps you understand that 10 hours in a chair can really mean something your wife or significant other may leave you due to the new smell that has appeared but at least you can cleanse the land of all that oppose you without being called a racist or going to jail
recommended
controlling your own civilization who wouldnt love that and with the expansion packs you can just keep going forever you can also get the satisfaction of beating your militaristic friends with science there is only one thing i dont like about this gamethose damned barbarians
recommended
best strategy game ive ever played its silly how addicting this game is once you start a game and you get into it  you instantly forget about time
recommended
the game is easy to learn and once you learn it you cant stop there is so much variety with each game that you have each one lasting about 6 hours you can never stop playing you have been warned i also reccomend getting the expansions they make it much more intresting with more stuff to do and balanced
recommended
one more turn am i right lol
recommended
ciiv 5 is a great game for those who wish to become a warmongering menace to the rest of the world fight your enemies sack their cities and enslave their population ahem i mean ask them nicely to join youin the name of peace of course nah just kidding rampage through their territory and when they ask for peace extend to them the warm glow brought only by a nuclear missile remember kids my words are backed by nuclear weapons im warlord gandhi and i approve this message
recommended
certainly a fun game it is fabulous to declare war with everyone on the first turn and win the game add some friends into the mix for more awesome i would not recommend this game to someone who is not patient games take upwards of 3 hours to complete on average
recommended
this has to be the greatest investment ive made on steam in the two years ive been using it civilization v is an amazing turnbased strategy game and although im not a seasoned fan of the franchise as ive only been playing this for a year it deserves the hundreds of reccomendations it has and im sure that even with beyond earth being released civ v will continue to be competitive throughout steam i have to say this is there is no word good enough to describe this game
recommended
definatly one of my favorites
recommended
>long time player >played a game with ethipoia and india >turns out ethipoia doesnt care about food when both ethipoia and gundi both nuke you on the same turn >good game would get nuked by peace leader and a starving country again 42010
recommended
too hard to understand i hate it how can i get my money back that is what i used to say to this game i completely change my mind this game is endless fun
recommended
sid meier is apparantely da creator of da world since he has many civilizations 1010 would civil again
recommended
this game is worth every cent i paid for it
recommended
great game a must for every strategy lover
recommended
good old civ
recommended
the fluidity and addictive nature of this game really made me feel comfortable as a first time strategy game player a must buy unless you value your social life
recommended
one of the best turn based strategy games remember not only war strategy fun to play expecially with friends but a word of warning really heavy on the processor in the late game atleast on mp hybrid mode my advice use standard turns in mp too helps a bit so if you like turn based strategy were you dont have to kill everybody play this brave new world makes it lot better 
recommended
this is simply a master piece with unlimited replay value and outstanding complexity this game could just be the end of all other games
recommended
i enjoy this game very much sadly it makes the hours fly by without notice multiple ways to win with diversification on the races plenty to try with great replayability
recommended
great game with unlimited potential easy installation on mods and i got the gold edition gnk for only 15 dollars
recommended
an amazing game the expansions make this game greater but the base game works just fine when getting this game realise games take a long time to complete overall great way to waste time 1010
recommended
i am your king now give me your virgins ahem very nice game makes you feel powerful really deep very thought provoking excellent
recommended
girlfriend is jealous of the game
recommended
fun game with seriously flawed ai
recommended
ive played the very first and am debating getting the new one this one is miles better then the first but just as enjoyable if not more so the different scenarios and ways to win mean you can always pick up the game and do something different i play on the easy setting most of the time just for the enjoyment of an easy world domination i think its easy to play but that may be as ive just had to learn improvements on each edition great waste of a day 
recommended
i recently tried the expansion to this game brave new world and i must say that i am very impressed the new voting system in the united nations absolutely gives new play options for experenced players it keeps you thinking about more than just conquest and finally gives you a reason to be diplomatic
recommended
its alright
recommended
one of the most enjoyable games i have ever played
recommended
civ v is a good game and i have played civ since civ 3 i would however recommend getting bnw  brave new world  for a vastly more enjoyable game experience
recommended
stunningly good turnbased strategy no wonder  giggity  its one of the most played games on steam getting it for the singeplayer is a nobrainer but beware the multipayer is very unstable
recommended
wontstopuntillihavedestroyedeverything
recommended
i do injoy the game style of the game as being both challenging and fun is aways a plus in a turn based game
recommended
this game is great for people who are firsttime strategy gamers the idea of the time line from begining of civilization to the future is very rare for all i know this is the only game that has this time line
recommended
great game
recommended
you will forget to eat because of this game
recommended
user friendly for those who are fairly unfamiliar with the rts genre and gameplay its addicting enough to the point where id be up till 3am and not realize it just blankly looking at my screen and yelling ing god damn alexander stop trying to start a war with me it is amazingly fun and the games can go on for a very long time i think my first game lasted about 910 hours its an rts fans staple and for good reason
recommended
warning exercise caution if you are considering picking up civ 5 then you must beaware of its incredibly addictive nature this is the game series that spawned the phrase just one more turn 8 hours later just one more turn
recommended
iron ore > friendship
recommended
this is quite possibly the best game i own i have had hours and hours of fun on this not only on my own but also with my girlfriend in the hotseat mode and also online with my friends 1010
recommended
dont even think you can just go ahead and play a few rounds of this for an hour or so you would end up spending your whole day playing it dehydrated and hungry just to plan your revenge on the damn greece its freaking awesome
recommended
amazing strategic gameplay especially in late game this is one of those games which you need friends to play with or you wont get too much enjoyment out of the game i would choose this game any day of the week over any of the other strategic turn based and not turn based games available on steam it is a pricey game but it is well worth it i got it for 20 usd on sale i would recommend also getting all dlcs if not all dlcs then at least get brave new world andor gods and kings it really ups the gameplay and the amount of things you can do in the game 1010 would nuke and giant death robot again
recommended
best game ever so much fun played it for more the 100 i suggest this to all strategy loving people
recommended
new to the civilization series played it for 8 hours on the first day
recommended
this is one of the best games ever made of its kind you can it play for hours without getting bored i recommend this game to everyone who is interested in a well made strategic game it offers enough to keep you interested wether you play it alone or with friends
recommended
this is one of the best strategy game ever you can keep playing for hours even days dont mind my hrs record ive played this game long before i bought its steam version
recommended
in my opinion its one o the best in the series ex aequo with civ 3 performace isnt too bad even on old 4 years old pc or my not so powerful school laptop definitely its worth full price now even better with 50% off grab it and grab a friend or few to play and have fun
recommended
in love with this game
recommended
apart from a few crashes here and there partially my own error it is an amazing game for best experience you need the dlc
recommended
this is the game i play the most nuff said
recommended
you start out trying to be nice to everyone as they all offer you  deals and denounce you for no reason as you get further and further ahead eventually someone declares war and you having had quite enough of their  bomb them back into the stone age then they offer you horses if youll stop murdering them while in the midst of the modern age you seize one little capital and suddenly everyone in the world hates you for warmongering so you decide to live up to their expectations and conquer the world such is life in civ v  anonymous of fj

if youre going to buy this be ready to buy expansion packs if not dont
recommended
i am an avid player of strategy games like age of mythology and age of empires but when i saw this game i thought i wouldnt like it but i changed my mind quickly after i got it the gameplay is great the endless playability is amazing the online support is fantastic and the fact that you dont have to have a 10 ping internet connection to be able to play well since it is a slow turn based game the game comes with multiple expansion packs that add countless more hours of playtime to your account and mods are completely optional i rarely find myself playing with mods due to the endless replayability of the game 1010
recommended
its been a while since i lost myself in a game but i found myself enjoying this so much i ended up loosing half a day without realising it its a super enjoyable game that id recommend to all but do try the demo first if your unsure
recommended
this game is amazing i highly recommend it play the tutorial first though you will need it if you arent used to turnbased strategy games
recommended
edit all of this is written assuming youll buy the two expansions aswell dont get it without them i have not written a review for this yet somehow good game fun with people not the best civ to date but still good if you dont mind dealing with an old game get iv instead but this is alright substitute and most of the  can be added in by mods no modded multiplayer though and a ed up trading bug which hasnt been fixed after years
recommended
this is a great game untill you have ing siam the dutch and japan taking their bombers and ing you straight in the  but other then the japanese samurais slowly taking my  in if you feel the need to be ed so hard this is the game for you tenouttaten would play again
recommended
welcome to civilization 5 a turnbased strategy game where you are tasked with building the biggest empire and winning the game either by means of science military diplomacy or cultural influence choose the civilization you wish whether thats sending russia to space or having genghis khan become world leader what is good about this is that it is so immersive you can really get stuck into a game and before you know it youre late for work yet while that is fairly undesirable you cant help yourself from advancing into the next era or hold off a few more turns until the wonder youve been working on is completed or even telling yourself youll just keep playing till you win days may fly by but the sense of achievement when you complete a game of civ 5 is overwhelming and makes you just feel pretty good to play the game you will require a quickthinking brain as sometimes the slightest of decisions can result in finding an army on your front door or could leave you at the bottom of the research table to stay afloat you must act fast and establish the means to produce a military quickly should you be attacked but also to keep your research going but dont have too many citizens or your people will become unhappy great strategy game that will be played for years to come definately recommended
recommended
i think that the game has an interesting array of oppertunities to make each game different from the last i rate this a yes game for someone who gets bored easily and wants a challenge to ceep himher occupied
recommended
well this game is very enjoyable for its strategy based control system i also love the fact that it contains historical information which makes it a bit educational as well but what makes this game very enjoyable is the game play itself since you can raise a great empire in any direction you want to go from a peacemaker to a powerful overlord who crushes their enemies its a refreshing break from your typical hack and slasher games or fps based games not to mention the graphics are nice as well if you like starcraft then youll like this game as well
recommended
civilization 5 is all about building up your own civilization with your own religion and rules you can do anything you like which allows you to customize your game even further

sid meiers civilization v complete is a turnedbased 4x strategy game from the stone age to the space age lead your civilization to span the globe competing against your rivals as you establish cities research technologies and build your units to stand the test of time this review is based on the base game the gods & kings and brave new world expansions and 13 dlcs that add additional civilizations map generators and game scenarios pros  bringing the game to hexagons and limiting it to 1 unit per tile are two bold steps away from past versions that completely revolutionized the strategy section of the game as you must now plan prepare and place your units you have a huge selection of distinct civilizations to chose from each of their leaders being memorable opponents may they be friend or foe depending of which religion they adopt in the early game or which social ideology they identify to in the late game will you use brute force to have your armies march through your enemies overrun other cultures with yours with the tourism generated by your arists writers musicians or artifacts from archeological digs use trade routes and influence to have other nations and city states to elect you world leader of the united nations or surpass humanitys science as you send the first interstallar ship to alpha centauri cons  there is little in form of story quests or accomplishments to be had in a game the ai negociation although better than past civilizations is still broken when it comes to negociating or reasonning with it the game itself is a resource hog and the game will slow down in late game no manner how powerful your pc or mac is verdict  i strongly recommand this game the replayability is incredible you can play a thousand game and never play the same one twice the variety of civilizations allow you to try different approach different styles and different strengths with each play through
recommended
tons of fun both on singleplayer or multiplayer highly suggest getting this definatly worth your money

seriously hi is one of the best games ive ever played theres amassive world aninfinite amount of possibilities for playhrough and a great community in the steam workshop especially great with the gods and kings  brave new world dlc also really appreciated the mta nui map mo brought back some memories

with hindsight i can tell you that even at full price the full civ v package including dlcs is well worth the price this is one of the most complex interesting and engaging games that ive ever played you have a massive list of civs to play from which all have unique playstyles suited to them so you can play an infinite amount of games each of which can easily last 10 hours with ai controlled opponents or your friends online not only do the variety of civs make the game so deep but also the map choices that youre given you can choose your favourite map type of which there are continents islands and pangea to name a few which are all randomly generated or pick the random map type for a surprise if you somehow get bored of that there are also a number of scenarios that you can play in as well as the ability to crank up the difficulty to insane levels or  easy ones if you just enjoy stomping on everyone i can guarantee that if you think that youll enjoy this game that you will i thought about it for a year and finally got it in the winter sale and can only sing it praises but if youre really unsure about whether you want it and you dont want to drop the money on it then there is a demo available to get you hooked so i recommend trying that out before buying the game i highly recommend this game at a 910 it will absolutely ruin your life i should currently be doing work but just one more turn
recommended
great game its worth your monies if your willing to sell your soul to the game for about 30 hours strait for an amazing time d

france killed me with a nuke 1210

took over whole world only had india left until domination victory completion the only victory type enabled it was turn 430 i lost five turns later the nukes man the nukes 1000100 would get nuked again
recommended
this game is amazing you may have seen sid meiers civization beyond earth i still recommend this game rather than that because there as been more work on it than the new one if you buy this game you will want to buy all of the exspansions for it the exspansions exspand the game so much the base game is not near as fun as all of the exspansions combined i really would reccomend this game i play with my uncle all of the time and we kill each otheror work together and not even talking about all of the fun of smack talk this game is amazing to play and even better playing with freinds and family if you buy this game make sure to get someone you know to play with you also make sure to practice so much that you crush whoever you play with in an istant this game lets you achive complete and utter power buy this game
recommended
this game would probably be a lot better if my friends werent so  and played with me but other than that great game make sure you get both expansions
recommended
the newest iteration of one of the greatest series in gaming 250 hours on my steam version which is one of three versions that ive sunk a lot of time into
recommended
fantastic strategy game with the expansions its still pretty good without them challenging satisfying and replayable
recommended
one of the best strategy games ive played  an improvement in many aspects over civ iv as of the last expansion the game feels fully realised balancing combat economics diplomacy religion and culture superbly ai graphics and ui are all up to scratch while the mechanics are accessible but with timeconsuming depth equally fun alone or with friends  no other game has the same one more turn addiction  1010
recommended
easily my favorite strategy game and one of my top games overall it requires smarts cunning diplomicy skills and lots of multitasking with the complete edition now out you can buy the game and all the dlc which makes the game even better for a very fair price i can only say good things about this game except for one thing the combat is fairly lacking they had a good idea with all of the terrain bonuses and debuffs but when it comes to pvp its just hard to be able to attack and move your troops around because a lot of the time its whoever clicks first wins obviously thats not the case all the time and the combat is still pretty ok but if i had to make any complaint it would be that however all around this is a fastastic game and easily worth buying the complete edition
recommended
germany and russia went on a quest to rule the world 105 would conquer again ign

the next installation in sid meiers civilization series of games civilization v is a wonderful turnbased strategy game in which players can forge the history of an earthlike world as they rule it augustus caesar may declare war on george washington catherine the great may find that her cities are being bombed by mahatma gandhi initially met with some criticism over how it plays in comparison to its numerical predecessor civilization iv civ v is still an excellent game that is improved immensely by its dlc please note that anyone buying dlc may be better off buying only brave new world rather than brave new world and gods and kings as brave new world adds everything added in gods and kings save for a few civilizations if you enjoy turn based strategy games with a focus on decisive victories through conquest culture diplomacy or science you certainly can not go wrong with civilization v
recommended
awesome game im actually adicted
recommended
this is really an upgrade from the old versions the complexity and multitudes in achieving victory combined with the different civilizational aspects provides an extreme diversity in each game the multiplayer experience is really the pinnacle of what started as civnet this game is truly enjoyable in the company of friends in multiplayer mode
recommended
until you have conquered the world as banana king of ethiopia one with an insatiable lust for bananas going as far as to commit genocide through nuclear weaponry just for their tasty goodness you have not lived

great game really enjoying it
recommended
great for people who dont mind slow paced games
recommended
if i had to pick one game to play for the rest of my life it would be this one every game i start feels fresh i never feel like there is nothing new to experience plus its really fun to play with friends
recommended
if you like rtss then this game is for you its one of my favs
recommended
this game is awesome get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of it
recommended
its like crack but you can quit crack
recommended
while ive never played a civilization game before this i absolutely fell in love with this game utterly fantastic 1010 would recommend
recommended
gotta love a game where if youre too nice to ghandi he nukes you 1010
recommended
very addicting especially with mods
recommended
deeply strategic great fun with freinds you will play entire days on it even better with all the dlc but try to buy it during a sale its really expensive
recommended
great game tons of things to do tons of fun if youre into rtss youll love these games
recommended
kiss goodbye to the sun because this is the biggest time sink ever
recommended
civilization 5 is a great entry in the series and a good one for beginners to start with since it has the designflaws of civilization revolution not as good as civilization 3 or 4 but its prettier and works better online than both of them so it gets the job done the expansionpacks cure what the vanillaversion lacked so make sure to get those right away otherwise you wont enjoy the game and even if you do you miss out on a lot of content tldr the game is bland if played vanilla with expansion  dlc the game is great
recommended
so addictive sooooo addictive
recommended
spectacularly good game definately one to pick up with friends and play when you get bored of repetetive fps i would recomend also getting the brave new world dlc aswell
recommended
though ive never really enjoyed strategy games sid meiers civilization v has definately been an enjoyable game to play though things arent always historically correct cough cough america in the ancient era its still fun trying to outlast the ai or the barbarians overall this is one of the best games ive played so far if you have the money get it
recommended
really this is a yes and no recomendation i like the new map setup and no unit stacking but its too simplified and sure dlcs fix that but that is $60 usd for both
recommended
takes about 48 hours to understand about an eigth of it but wow rewarding as ever extremely good game
recommended
the first time i tried civ 5 i wasnt much of a fan of the strategy genre of games that was until i play civ 5 it just simply has profoundly amazing gameplay stunning graphics and the replayability is great for trying out different styles of playing the game it has exceeded my expectations and i highly reccomend it
recommended
very good game a shame there are almost no nordicgermanic civs in standard got gold now
recommended
a great game i played it for a lot of hours the dlc of bnw brought a lot of new options to play the game sometimes the difficulty of the ais doesnt really resemble the difficulty you choose and of course the multiplayer is awesome d
recommended
i would recomend this game but only for those who have friends it is quite long and boring if you have no one to play with but thats just me
recommended
civilization v wgods & kings expansion is the best just one more turn game ever there are many mods for the game as well as a brand new expansion pack coming this summer
recommended
you know when you say to yourself in the morning ill do a few turns before going to work 1010 would never stop again
recommended
while more simpler and straightforward than other entries in the civilization series civilization v  despite possessing an overwhelming sense of something missing is a fun and enjoyable game nonetheless a game that seems more tailored to newcomers to the franchise civilization v pays great respect to presentation with a more alive and animated gameplay that civilization iv had left mostly to the imagination bringing new life into the world that players have been running around in for the past two decades while experienced civilization players may find emptiness in the many removed and replaced features and aspects compared to civilization iv and previous entries in the franchise others can find elation and waste countless hours with a game that on its own proves to be one hell of an experience what contributes mostly to the games attractive atmosphere are the opponents you play against in civilization v  all leaders that you compete alongside have been given such rich personalities through vivid animation and luscious voice acting giving new strategy to gameplay that isnt necesarily a physical aspect of the game but rather an emotional one for example caesars passiveagressive attitude and wu zetians consistently defiant personality gives weight to the players actions against these particular people deepening the fog of war and giving a new dimension to the gameplay while civilization v is undoubtedly better with the gods and kings and brave new world expansion packs which have been released in the years following the games original release the original vanilla release is still a great game on its own having played it bare for five years i still think civilization v is one of the best pc games on the market bold and beautiful its definitely a game you must play at least once before you die or twice or a hundred times
recommended
an awesome game i highly recommend it for a histo freak like me or just to relax the gameplay is relaxing and smooth depends on what difficulty it is it is great the mods in the workshop are mostly for the dlcs and the dlcs are also 30 bucks each so i would take the complete edition for that matter but if you are not in for the dlcs buy this game
recommended
playing civ 5 is like playing civ 5 you forget there are other games
recommended
i reccomend this game if you like turn based stratergy games i dont reccomend this game if you want to spend hours upon hours doing something useful
recommended
fun need to get the full version soon
recommended
really good game perfect for a group of friends to play with each other
recommended
murdered nobunaga as senator armstrong from metal gear rising then got nuked by ghandi 1010
recommended
probably the fifth game in the civilization series to date as such it fits its description well and as has been pointed out by shady figures of the various adulatorious delinquents that lurk in the shady fora surrounding the subject is playable enough to be truly identified as a game
recommended
the change to hexagonal shapes and removal of unit stacking has made combat more strategic and harder not sure if this game is better than civ 4 but its as good
recommended
awesome game wish there was more countries to play as though
recommended
1110 would lose most of my firends and social life again
recommended
yeah you should probably buy this game seriously do it
recommended
1010 would get nuked by ghandi again
recommended
a really fantastic game
recommended
one of the funnest games i have ever played easy relaxing and i get so caught up in it i loose myself
recommended
very good game
recommended
for years i ran a hobby club in my sons school focusing on civ iii civ v is the extension of that franchise and they have wisely adopted the hex format for their maps a livelong strategic game enthusiast who has designed my own games based upon the us civil war i find that the civ v developers are making the effort  and succeeding  at delivering a peerless strategic gaming experience onward vinceremos
recommended
a fantastic strategy game which is extremely addicting where you lead a civilization from prehistoric times into the future you can play on your own or with friends if you get bored of the game you can purchase some dlcs to make your experience even better a must buy for anyone who loves strategy games
recommended
ive never played any other strategy games likes this before but that didnt stop me from getting addicted to this my first night i played something like seven hours
recommended
civilization you are my doom my bane my everything my love you keep me so busy i forget the world you are great in so many ways and hurt me in so many others great game though seriously ive always loved the series and this one has a special place in my gaming library now after so much time in it i always enjoy what comes with my civ games
recommended
more addictive than cocaine 1010 would press next turn button again
recommended
this stuff is good i like this stuff
recommended
cool game but enemy calculations take a little long thus it gets lenghy if u play with lot of ai  the difficulty settings seem a bit easy
recommended
this game is really bad for my character every time i play it i become insane and just kill everyone in the game
recommended
and you thought skyrim was life consuming
recommended
i dont think there has ever been a game that makes me lose track of time as much as this
recommended
fun game wish it was less timeconsuming
recommended
one of my favorite games on steam much improved from civ 4 and easier for the regular player to pick up if you like any kind of rts or city building game then this is for you its basically a much simpler version of the total war games
recommended
this game is amazing
recommended
my most played steam game at least when i had a job where i could get away with it ive spent many enjoyable hours trying in vain to prevet world wars and build an arts culutre based civ would definitely play again for just one more turn
recommended
worth the money
recommended
lots of fun i recommend mods also
recommended
gosh i cant get enough of this game
recommended
very addictive and fun
recommended
my civ was full of illiterate  so i left them for dead to go live the pirate life on the sea 1010 would let egypt starve to death again
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is definately worth a play alot of people say its pretty much civ 2 with updated graphics which i donot think is a bad thing
recommended
this is a game i have wanted for a ong time and now i have played it i think it is even better than i could imagin
recommended
brother bought the game steamshared it to me two weeks later i got the game bought by myself
recommended
one of the best
recommended
the only game in which you will be nuked by ghandi and wage war on saudi arabia for taking all your  land you knew you were gonna settle there sorry i got a little carried away there its just that im a little bit absolutely livid anyways here are some pros and cons of civ v pros no longer will you sit down and wait for minutes to go by because gmod has nothing for you to play enjoy being a  to everybody around you with almost no consequence because why would you not play on the easiest difficulty nuclear warfare isnt as bad as it should be one of your cities just exploded make another seven extreme online capabilities mods mods mods cons ghandi saudi arabia ghandi ghandi ing ghandi why ghandi why theres more difficulties than chieftain
recommended
brilliant gameplay challenging when you could face off huge armies against many countires countless armies strategic treeadvancement depending on how you like winning the game love the aspects like creating a religion that would ensure a diplomatic win and such
recommended
probably the best game in the world 
recommended
diplomacy culture and science victories can be summarized in clicking on the right buildings until you win only fun if you win via domination
recommended
one of the best games i have played i highly recommend checking this out and on sale woah youll regret not
recommended
very original game which has brought lots of fun memories for me and my buddies  if you want a strategic game based on real time events buy this
recommended
i played 500 pm i looked at the clock the slavs had guns already 600 pm i looked at the clock everyone hates me for destroying carthage 700 pm i killed everybody who opposed me 800 pm i looked at the clock 600 am 1010 still have the last turn syndrome i guess
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is a very fun and strategic game the mechanics in the game are amazing and i would recommend this game to anyone  those who want to go to war those who want to build a civilization those who want to dominate the economy or those who want to do scientific advancements
recommended
love this game
recommended
great fun with friends
recommended
if you wanna be trapped in your room by the chrystal meth of turn based strategy for daysthis is an absolute recommendationif you still have a job and family thisll strain your relationships for a few weeks
recommended
love this game i myself am a huge fan of the civ series
recommended
really fun once you learn how to play
recommended
either die as a legend or live long enough to see mongolia betray you
recommended
the game with the two expansions g&k  bnw changes completely from the vanilla game originally released it is a completely new experience you have new units plus a lot of new features to try the new ideologies plus tourism and the related cultural victory is a great new addition really i havent got any problems finishing the game first on marathon length on prince no special ai bonuses the only drawback i find is that without many bonuses the ai has a hard time to keep up with the player after the industrial era especially if you run for the artillery unit and start decimating the rest of the factions higher difficulty levels give many different ai bonuses to balance the game some people may not really like this because it is very easy to notice the ai bonuses especially early in the game
recommended
the last time i played civilization was civ2 although i bought both civ3 and civ4 i played for less than an hour each because they really sucked as for civ5 i had little faith in it but bought it anyway because i collect the series and i waited until it released the complete scenario packages at discount prices before buying it happily civ5 was nowhere near the suckiness of its predecessors its really very good and addictive much like civ2 however after all this time presumably dozens of patches and updates there are still a lot of bugs some annoying and some even showstoppers good thing the showstoppers can be corrected by a simple savegame reload but the worst is probably its very slow even on my intel i7 raid ssd system it could even take for the game to think a couple of minutes each turn when you have conquered much of the world map last but not least ai seems weak a hundred hours gameplay later the computer players have never declared war on me its always me declaring war on them 4 out of 5 stars at the mostand i am being generous nonetheless i still recommend it
recommended
civ 5 is a brilliant game it has beautiful graphics perfect performance on proper machines that can take it with detailed and handy systems for creating your own civ i suggest the dlc due to its offering of a new religion you can personalise which is always fun gets boring pretty quickly ive found it best to play in multiplayer with friends as it gets very boring very quickly as theres not much action at the start even if you set the speed to fast beautiful will run on most computers boring at points
recommended
awesome game i had a 1000 year long war with japan then i got nukes
recommended
other than slow load times especially when you are running mods and playing on a large scale with lots of civilizations this game is too fun adding wonder and building mods also adds so much more depth to the game yet can slightly imbalance some strategies
recommended
best turn by turn strategy game ever but remember to tink
recommended
awesome game  maybe a little easier than civ 4 but still needs some thinking nice graphics and sounds it is most fun with the brave new worlds dlc 910
recommended
910  this is a great game tive points  contender for most addicting game i have ever played literally youll say ill just start playinholy  its been seven hours civ 5 perfectly encapsulates an allround fun experience there is so much to do in a single playthrough but all of it comes together in a brilliant package every civilization is different and requires different tactics but all are fun to play as personally my favourite is greece becasue of this youll have so many campagins you just lose your life multiplayer is unbelieveabley fun a whole day can just be spent with your friends just having a brilliant time combat is fun wonder races are challenging every civ has personality the map is beautiful it is just fun tive points  there are negatives however mainly being in dlc do not buy the base game bnw is required to play the game to its full capabilities without it the game is probably a 710 the only beef i have with this game is that it is made to produce dlc you could see it from a mile off just like with beyond earth im also not a fan of the difficulty settings id prefer it if the ai were smarter and not just given buffs to improve their play this means it is no where near the most challenging stratergy game when competing against the likes of its paradox brethren for instance overall this is a very fun and addictive stratergy game but bnw is required
recommended
every hour spent on this game has been a good investment i was skeptical at first seeing as how i had never seen myself as a strategy game fan but civ 5 changed my perspective on that within the first few minutes the diversity and depth of the game is astonishing and is worth everything and more
recommended
this is probably my favorite turnbased strategyboard game that ive played you should play it
recommended
one of my favorite 4x games provided that you get the brave new world dlcalso has a great mod community a must own for 4x lovers
recommended
civ 5 is one of those different games you know your just bored of playing a fps and youre like oh i feel like i want to play a game that is actually not a fps and thats were civ 5 comes in through the door and punches you in the face and is like what the  man why does no one like me and everyone only plays fps games and im like because no one has no ing clue on what the history was for the japanese the end
recommended
to be honest i cant believe i got this amazing game for free the developers deserve recognision for making such a fun stratergestic game like no other this provides hours and hours of fun on multiplayer and yes even singleplayer before you know it its bed time and youve got to part with this smooth running great looking fantastic game its defintley something your guna play often with a group of friends great 710
recommended
its like meth but youll lose more friends by using this
recommended
civ 5 is a horrible game

this game is simply amazing

recommended
buy it and become addicted
recommended
this game is freaking awesome
recommended
i nuked everyone as gandhi 1010
recommended
wanted to see how france would do in the middle of africa want to reach space want to create a cultural influence which makes other civilizations culture look insignificant or maybe your faith in the powers that be will lead you to glory want to do all of this and more go ahead these things arent only the greatest parts of civilization 5 as you lead your small minute civilization to greatness or failure if you are destroyed by the strongest who can stand the test of time but never mind that can you the main strength of this game is the wide amount of flexibility allowed for every leader but still keeping their image and real life legacies intact so what if the russia didnt actually go down the freedom path or america didnt choose piety over rationalism it all adds to the way the game is smooth and easy going whilst making sure none of the leaders are changed in any way to their real life counterparts overall this game is a strong interpretation of the real world many games such as the democracy franchise simulate the political aspects of modern life but no game can better civilzation v on its simulation of the development of mankind
recommended
great game
recommended
i played all the civilization games and enjoy wasting my time on it
recommended
great strategic game strongly advise trying the demo
recommended
an amazing game people who want a challenge have to buy this
recommended
countries and stuff
recommended
this game is ing fabulous highly recommended the gods & kings and brave new world expansion packs are a must have
recommended
soooooo addicting
recommended
oh dear god where did all my time go where am i
recommended
warning highly addictive sid meirs civilization v is a turnbased strategy game designed to take you through the eras of mankind while you expand your civilisation there truly isnt another game on the market which delivers an experience quite like this the game features no story driven campaign mode the closest being scenario games through dlc instead you setup your game preferences and launch the game typically begins with one combat unit and one settler unit who will form your first city this is where your story begins the game will always offer a completely different experience from the last match played due to its random seed generator different civilisations personalities and resource placement personally i feel what can limit a good experience of this game is a lack of imagination one match i formed an alliance with my neighbour rome early in the game because of mongolias warmongering and mass expansion of its territories so together i the ottomans and rome formed a coalition military and advanced on mongolia to knock them down a peg or two soon after we declared war on mongolia and we sustained a few loses romes forces pulled back i could only assume this was due to their economy being in recession and couldnt afford to train new troops and risk rome being defenceless my economy however was booming due to my northern trade routes with the english so my forces pressed on determined to liberate the captured citystate of monaco from the blood thirsty mongolians my troops succeeded at a high cost losing many regiments and more men being crushed by the mongolian might on their journey home back to the capital it was at this moment rome stabbed me in the back and invaded my lands with a huge force destroying my trade routes with the english and bringing my income to its knees the rest of the game and my relationship with rome turned into a back and forth battle of gaining and loosing territory from each other while my relationship with mongolia grew stronger why did rome do this i hear you ask because they were simple being racists or at least thats how i interoperated it through a politicians indirect use of language unlike many strategy games turnbased and realtime civ v can be picked up pretty quickly if this is your first civ title youll be familiar with the formula in not long at all its a very easy game to learn but can be a hard game to win sometimes it can feel like the ai isnt even trying other times you can come under constant invasions if i had to pick the worse point about this game itd be the ai in diplomacy isnt perfect with a few of the dialogue options making no difference to what the outcome will be
recommended
great addition to the civilization series with all the dlc the game evolves and becomes an even more intriguing and challenging experience
recommended
egypt is overpowered
recommended
this a highly fun and addicting game it is a little different from civ 4 like getting rid of health of cities  sadly  and the stacks of units  thankfully  i also recommend getting the expansion packs as they add much more bulk to the game  more diplomacy  international trade  religion  etc  1010
recommended
this is a absoloutsly fantastic strategy game the best of its kind extremely highly reccomended
recommended
this game didnt cure my virginity 
recommended
lots of fun you should also get civ 5 sdk
recommended
a very casual turnbased strategy game great game do not hesitate just buy it
recommended
this game was good on the free weekend cant wait to eventually get it with the bundle d
recommended
this game can get very addicting and is very fun in multiplayer other strategy games multiplayers should mimic this one as well as have there one kind how you play the game is very addictive and its like you never want to stop and always say just one mroe turn turns out to be 24 turns def a must buy for anybody even if your not a big fan of strategy games as this one doesnt require as much thought process as many other strategy games
recommended
simply one of the best strategy games ive ever played the best thing about civilization is that its so different every time you play it it never gets boring 1210 would bang
recommended
holy crap this is fun archers op 1010 would nuke everyone again
recommended
great game but you need lots of time and all the expansions im a big fan of the civ series and have spent countless hours on the past games
recommended

recommended
civilization 5 civ v i s one of the greatest strategy games ever just like all the predecessors lots of difrent way to play and never ending game time
recommended
i highly recommend this game the graphics are awesome and the gameplay is so open that you can run any civ how you want although some strategies are more effective than others with certain factions the game allows for so much variation between individual games and you will never play the same match twice because of random starting points and different civs that you face
recommended
what can i say pew pew lets go to war or not your choice
recommended
ing caesaralways there to  thing upfor  sake i just trespass your land once
recommended
its good
recommended
only get if you like turnbased strategy games that can make hours disappear from your day
recommended
i have not played many hours of civ 5 but i would like to give my intial thoughts and views on this game i would like to start by comparing this game to a board game think catan with a little bit of risk moved in now that you can view it as this now add in a little of age of empires this is a turned based version of these gamesboard games are usually turned based the atmosphere is great and the initail game i played had me stuck for 6 hours straight this game is very good as it keeps you stuck in for the long haul the objectives in the game are great as there is more than one way to win you can build a giant army and march across the battlefeild crushing your enemys going the cultural root and increasing your artistic side of the city this gives the game varity and replayability the diffrent racesworld leaders you can choose from also gives the game a great uniqueness that allows for hours of gameplay there is no story there is just advance you civilisation 5 to the best point by researching diffrent things and building unique buildings from throughout history there is a multiplayer that i have not yet delved into i believe the multiplayer would increase the game time by at least another 23 hours i have an estimation that each game on normal of about 68 hours this game takes some thinking and a few of the actions take a while to figure out this game is very good at explaining what you have to do to learn how to play from what i have played so far i would say this is a very great game and has given me the longest single sitting in anygame i have played in for a very very long time well worth a look at the time of this review the game and the dlc is avalible on humblebundlecom for $15 as well as some other games
recommended
new to civ play civ 5
recommended
civ 5 is the best 4x game ever made better then even the great civ 5 not only does it look great it feels and plays great get the bnw and gk to make it even better who doesent want to be gandhi and take over the world i would also suggest you play it with friends since back stabbing your friends never felt so good i give it a 8510 and a 9510 if you got some of the dlc like bnw and gk
recommended
worst game ive ever played 9991000

this game taught me more about foreign politics than the education system has
recommended
i have played the civilization iv as well and i got to say that this truly beats the iv i will absolutely recommend this game
recommended
i love civ 5 but the only problem i have with it is not the game its the mods they are all for civ 5 brave new world i saw a cool mod that brought the lord of the rings to civ 5 but it was for brave new world i recomend people who played other civ games but for those who like mods to spice their game up i do not recomend
recommended
very good i think the decision to tone it down from iv was wellminded but i think they oversimplified it it felt kind of scummy to have to get gk and bnw to get features that would be a one stop shop in iv graphics are good i like the civilopedia and the historical accuracy i reccomend getting bnw instead of gk because bnw adds the equivalent of 2 expansion packs for the price of one unless you really want the maya or the celts still good game like the scenarios and pitboss dont think that games with expansion packs you dont have should be shown it saves a lot of time but if you like changing history and doing trolls to ai that dont know that youre trolling them get this game
recommended
one more turn
recommended
the best game
recommended
its like risk only you can save and come back to with withouyr your cheating little brother moving all your crap around
recommended
look at my play time and you figure out wether i think this is a good game or not you cant go wrong with it
recommended
great stuff if you like spending a lot of time on turn based strategy a lot of good things can be said about the game and im sure everyone said it already as a bad thing ill say if you like loading and saving a lot you might get bored easily as loading screens take ages to go by
recommended
civ v is my favorite civ so far maybe not counting civ ii but at this point my recollections are mostly nostalgia i may have put more hours into civ iv but that was because of fall from heaven an excellent mod civ v introduced so many wondeful changes including hex based maps 1 unit per hex to stop idiotic unit stacking though i think they should have let civilian units stack on each other and a revamped system for defining your civilization through policies the gods and kings added more of everything which is what i wanted it to do
recommended
sell the house sell the car sell the kids find someone else forget it im never coming back forget it typical civ player an hour after theyve started playing this game will devour your time and you will love every minute of it buy it now
recommended
classic game the fifth iteration is by far the best after a bit shaky 4 the fifth take on the immortal classic by sid meier hits the sweet spot not only is it gorgeous smooth and welldesigned graphically but it offers a great variety of features and complexity which does not feel forced recommend to play with both addons available to date gods and kings was not particularly good when it came out felt a bit early and not ready the second addon though fixed all of the problems while expanding those that felt a bit lacking if you got that turnbaseditch look no further than this game 
recommended
amazing you should get this if you dont already have it  always kill every other civilization oo or they keel you
recommended
without a doubt one of the most dangerous addictive gaves i have played
recommended
the beans have never been cooler
recommended
definitly one of the greatest games of all time playing as some of the greatest civilizations ever to walk the earth you must race for victory unlike some games in this there is multiple paths to take on your way to victory including scientific advancement taking over the world and discovering the united nation this game never gets old and is always fun to play
recommended
this game is amazing get it
recommended
sid meiers latest entry in the award winning civilization series is fantastic it allows you to rule a country however you would like be it peacefully allying yourself with others or steamrolling them with the feet of your armies the two expansions although steeply priced is a must for the full experience and i reccomend the dlc strongly if you love 4x games and have a lot of money in gifted steam cards than i highly reccomend considering civilization v however if you couldnt put a lot of time into one saved game a standard game could be awhile then you might want to look at less time intensive titles 1010
recommended
buy this game and it will eat your brains 010 needs shrek civ
recommended
its a great game full of adventures and upgrades you can research really excisting projects and monuments it looks a bit like age of empires ii but i think this game is more fun and more expensive
recommended
game constantly crashes i rarely go 10 turns without having to restart the whole game this is with running off 8 gb of ram with an intel core i5 processor very frustrating on the rate occasion the game works it is a great game and highly addictive
recommended
this is a good game but sooo much dlc they want all our money
recommended
our words are backed with nuclear weapons  mahatma gandhi the terrible of india nothing more to say 1010
recommended
amazing strategy game it is very fun although it is far better if you can get a group of friends together highly recommend
recommended
im going to get right to the point right now civilization v with gods and kings and brave new world might just be one of the best pc games ive ever played the potential for ingame experiences are limitless and the amount of customization is greatly welcomed which goes from individual unit names to complete civilization mods in addition to that are the scenarios which also have multiple ways to win as you rewrite history or complete it again gameplay wise the ai has gotten much better with the dlc on the vanilla verson of this game there is room for improvement in quite a few aspects which for the most part as far as i know have been fixed with the dlcs while this may not be a big problem for players new to the civ series for those who have been into civilization for a while may be disapointed with the basic version of this game however if you are willing to get the dlc the game is absolutely spectacular in other words new players should have no issues with the game but some more experienced players might be upset with the vanilla version with the dlc this game is one of the best out there but the vanilla civ v along with gods & kings and brave new world is $90 in all so if you want the best experience imo i would slowly get the dlcs until you are all caught up or you are satisfied as for fun value i would say this is the best purchase on steam that i have made 500 hours well spent and hopefully many more the game is as challenging as you want it to be but regardless you will find yourself going for justonemoreturn you might lose a bit of your social life and find that you just used up 8 hours when you thought it was only 23 hours but damn it at least it was fun overall with out a doubt i would recommend it
recommended
one of the all time best turnbased strategy games everything that made iv great plus much needed improvements to graphics and game mechanics dont expect to just play a short game be ready to sink a few hours into trying to dominate the world brave new world and gods and kings dlc really are necessary to get the full experience however
recommended
a game that requires commitment but once you get on the right track it is very enjoyable
recommended
this game is amazing i recommend the brave new world pack
recommended
i say playing as oda nobunaga and getting george cromwell born in the land of the rising sun really made me smile and gandhi nuked osaka twice
recommended
i bought this game about a year and a half ago i had read many reviews saying that this was a terrible game and that buying this would be a mistake i originally heeded these and bought civ 4 instead one day i was at target and saw it on the shelf and decided to try it out and see how it was i am so glad i decided to buy it i have 90 hours and it is still fun the one unit per tile is nice because it eliminates the person who would group 50 units on one tile and totally demolish you the original damage system was good and with the 2 expansion packs it is even better i remember that in civ 4 i frequently saw archers take down helicopters and it angered me it now has a damage system of 1100 so with each archer giving 1 damage it would now take 100 archers to take down one helicopter the original game is very good and the 2 currently available expansion packs make it even better gods and kings adds religion more countries more units etc brave new world improves religion adds tade routes adds civs units etc the game is worth $30 but commonly goes on sale for $750 so you should just wait for a sale i would give this a 910
recommended
this is worse than crack  1110  would buy again 
recommended
if you buy a game purely from how much hours you get from it this game should be worth 100 its  how much time i spent the first week i got this game i spent the whole first week playing this game wake up play eat sleep wake up play eat sleep for a week for one game of civ just buy it if you want to lose the rest of your days it is now belong to sid meier
recommended
this game is amazing
recommended
a must have for anyone who likes turn based strategy games the game itself is fun and simple its a bit overwhelming at first but when you get down to it and play a couple of turns do a bit of reading on the units and structures itll all make sense it is however a lengthy game it could take hours or days to finish a single game this is practically this games only major flaw
recommended
addicting  like its predecessors a game to spend the whole day saying  just one more turn how i missed my civ marathons ^^ 
recommended
its ok
recommended
i think this is a wonderful game and i have played manyu hours of multiplayer that gameplay is really fun and i reccommend this game
recommended
a great play for those who are willing to stay on the same game for hours and hours the game itself has tons of replayability and has some great well priced expansion packs that add even more stuff to the game
recommended
i can deffinitly recommend this game to all strategy game lovers if anyone ever played any of the earlier civilization games you should not expect it to be too much like the older ones yet even though stuff has been changed or even taken away that is more than outweighed by new additions extremely well done graphics the new soundtracks and the new combat system
recommended
seriously its civ 5 if you dont own this game alreadyyou have something wrong with your head brain if you ever wanted to nuke ghandi backstab boudicca and setup trade agreements with geroge washington all in the same turn this is your game if you ever wanted to invade rome with a mix of spearman and tanks well youre stupid but buy this game if you havent bought this game buy this game
recommended
best stratergy game of the decade
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played incredibely fun when playing with friends
recommended
excellent game just enough of everything i played original g&k and bnw while there are some thing id like to see improved amazing game overall
recommended
this game is one of the best ive ever played its a deep simulation game that is good to play in both single player and multiplayer id definately recommend this to any strategy fan that has somehow missed this i think that this with bnw is better than civ iv but civ iv is good too
recommended
you may have heard jokes regarding this game and its ilk that go something along the lines of just one more turn oh hey its 6am you are mistaken those are not jokes
recommended
who knew a strategy game could be so dang fun
recommended
absoloutlet love this game really good game to pass the time especially when bored
recommended
greatest game ever
recommended
a brilliant game on the higher levels it is challenging yet just as addictive multiplayer gameplay is amazing especially with expansion packs enabled however make sure you and your partners have a stable internet connection as the game may have a tendancy to drop midway through there are many mods available for this game and i adivse you all to check them out i am an avid fan of sid meier and cannot wat to see what they come out with next definately recommended
recommended
with way more than 200 hours of gameplay steam is always about 40% of what i actually played this is my most played game in my library this is not the greatest game of all time but it is probably in my top three with portal 2 as the greatest game of all time while this game does take long it is worth it and very consuming i love this game and i would most definitely recommend it i love this game
recommended
so my friend said this was a good game i bought it omg this game is easy to get the hang of but extremely difficult to master so many different civilizations and so many different factors a turn based game where you control all of your units and build buildings and wonders construct the statue of liberty and the pyramids in 1 city and build other cities to grow your civilization there is so much to do on this game and so much replayability there are so many variants you could play as one leader one time and play that leader again the next game and the outcome could be completely different you could win a culture victory one time and a domination victory another time and the expansion packs add a bazzilion more things to do like there wasnt enough already simply get this game
recommended
brilliant the best turn based game by far hours can be spent playing this game with the possibility of victory being just one more click away with the current expansion there are plently of scerniros to play in along with a large community of mods just watch out for gandhi
recommended
one of the best investments i ever made and once you start playing you really dont want to stop until you win also makes any day gone in a flash 
recommended
brave new world expands economic and cultural development but pacifies civilization v peaceful management of your empires culture and economy is now more active and challenging irrespective of empire size war has been strongly discouraged via excessive economic and diplomatic penalties overall theres a huge amount of base game content and completely new features in the series keep the game engaging throughout full reviews on my blog httpwwwmegabearsfannetpost20131019civilizationvbravenewworldexpansionreviewaspx review of the major fall patch for brave new world 2013 httpwwwmegabearsfannetpost20131125civvbnwfallpatchreviewaspx
recommended
this is a amazing game that i recommend anyone to buy but warning you may spend a lot of time playing this game
recommended
so i bought it friday night by the end of sunday i had played 16 hours highly addicting the games are upwards of 8 hours each and require a great amount of strategymilitary technology diplomacy resource management etc if you love rts games or even if you dont get this civ is probably the the best turnbased strategy series 1110 would play forever
recommended
1010 would nuke gandhi again
recommended
this is a game for people with big  7 inch plus only
recommended
good game but terrible online connection issues which never get sorted
recommended
great strategy game better with friends i recommend this game for everyone
recommended
i love this game of stratagy and thinking ahead its good for training yourself to think ahead and think what your opponets might do next
recommended
single player is fun i have been playing it a lot the past week and even though i feel like i still dont get everything i dont have to in order for it to be fun after getting a really good deal for the game and all existing dlc i feel like i havent even scratched the surface in things i can do only major complaint i have is that players online suck not as players though they will mostly pick overpowered civs to try to compensate for something no as people they do they will quit the first time something doesnt go their way lose units to barbarians cause they are being dumb lose out on a world wonder they were building etc to the point where you are playing against all ai before you can even build up an army to face the other civs that takes all the fun out of trying to play online
recommended
this game comes with an addiction problem
recommended
the best turn based strategy game out there
recommended
an excellent strategy and conquest game completely worth the 20$
recommended
1 more turned my spring break away 1010
recommended
awesome game which requires much intelligence
recommended
sometimes i play this game and my dog starts floating
recommended
aight listen up at first it may seem like a boring  game but thats because you havent played it yet my a listen as soon as you have a few warriors and builders up the game gets incredibly fun like you can  people and be like yo what it is  and divebomb entire ing cities bruh if you do have any power in real life  get civ 5 and rule entire nations bruh this game is better than watching shrek  on an onion and eating it as part of the shrekian ritual to worship our lord and savior shrek now thats saying something and even if you geet bored aand youre like i beat the game on every single difficulty with every leader now what theres a bunch of stuff you can download n stuff now go buy this game or if you already own it play it nuff said tldr  you read the whole thinng you lazy piece of 
recommended
the greate and best strategy ever there are a lot of kinds of development of ur state in this game you can become a rich person and make boom to other countries on the other hand u can fight for every piece of land and struggle seemingly insignificant from the poor state so this game is rly enjoyable and diversful 9510
recommended
takes forever but is fun only get if you like strategy games
recommended
the greatest game ever
recommended
this game is amazing
recommended
i have played this way way way way way way way way too much but i dont regret a minute of it
recommended
this game is great love it
recommended
do not get this game if you have a short attention span this is a strategy game that requires a lot of thinking planning and time
recommended
the game feels finished and plays well its an improvement over civ 4 in every way save mutliplayer which is awful lacking mod support animated leader heads etc fleshed out multiplayer would be much appreciated
recommended
this is one of the better simulator games out there accurately representing the hundreds of years it takes to build a dirt road ten kilometres long
recommended
civ v is the best in the series so far definitely one of my favorite games of all time
recommended
its worse than a plane flight
recommended
the best game ever well i have played this game for 60hrs now so i think its time for me to do a rewiew i only have one word for this game and that word is awesome the game is adictive and fun becaus you make your own story like dayz you do not have a specific goal exceppt make your civilization soo good and big as possibal for you that dont know a  about this game read this you start the game in the ancient time with some few settlers and warriors then you found your capital city on a good place and start build things and units in your town when you research new technology you will be able to build new stuff and when all of the technology in that era is researcht you will enter a new era on you way to a great empire you will meet other nations and city states that you may choose to be friend with or wage war agienst this is where the hard part start and when you start to make choices that madder and its here the endless replayability is becaus you maybe whant to have world domination or be a friendly guy that help empires with food and other stuff well thats the basic and i cant wright everything but i promise you that this game is one of the best games ever made becaus off the free choices and the power you feal when you controll a great empire or win a big world war and one more thing if you think this game is nice i strongly recommend the total war series becaus it has some simular stuff to civ 5 but here you get a game that is focesed on war and its a combination of turn based stratigy and rts where you will get a close view of the battlefield with your troops rts stands for real time stratigy if you dident know
recommended
a pretty good strategy game with historically relevant civilations only really lacking some versatility 710
recommended
such strategy much countries many faith such resources
recommended
one of the best strategy games out there
recommended
awesome if gold edition
recommended
i love this game if you have a life you might want to discard it now
recommended
highly addictive the just one more turn and ill go to bed mentality has kept me up late to many times playing this game
recommended
this game was a fan since civ 4 and this game is a great sequel so i do really reccomend this if your a fan of strategy
recommended
this game lets you play through history your way playing as the japanese england ect this is one of the best games i own currently
recommended
fun with friends
recommended
this game is easily my favorite game in my library it provide all the things i love in a game a social aspect great quality and overall stratagy go get it now
recommended
its fun to play but hard to get the hang of at first
recommended
awesome people who like to take over the world
recommended
the game itself is really good but if youve never played any civilization or something similiar before you shouldve try it out first maybe your friend has it because well personally i love turnbase strategy game so i thought this gamed be fun after playing a bit i can see why people are so addicted to this game but somehow i cant enjoy it probably because its too slow for me i regret buying this game but seriously try it if you like it this game is really worth the money
recommended
fun but it would most definetly be better with workshop support for the mac
recommended
civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played i definitely recommend that you buy it
recommended
a great 4x game that just keeps on getting better with each dlc cant wait for the latest one
recommended
its like a rts just with more civilized people
recommended
this game is awesome until you meet ghandi he is actually the worst person ever
recommended
this game is great for people who are looking for a long strategy game to play very indept and very enjoyable
recommended
surprisingly addictive game extremely diluted grand strategy fit for newcomers to the genreidiots if you play games like crusader kings avoid but if your coming from games like call of duty or starcraft this might be for you wait nvm ghandi just nuked my capital brb
recommended
an realy awsome game i liked it and it actually teach me some stuff you can learn stuff from the game and i had a great time playing with it
recommended
if you are going to play this be sure to have alot of hours  yes literally some days it takes forever but when you have world domination nothing beats that felling myself really enjoys spending countless hours on this game just because you get to conquer all in any way you want
recommended
heaps of fun to play with your friends and the single player is fun if you feel like trashing some bots with large militaries
recommended
warning may cause severe addiction losing grip of reality and pain in your butt
recommended
civ v is my deault game pure and simple only got an hour play a few turns and save cleaning up the house turned based is excellent to be able to walk away from while the other players are simulated the additional senarios leave much content yet to be explored but what i have only adds to the greatness mods pirates and hobbits on tatooine and done
recommended
its civ and the best one yet what more can i say
recommended
the classic game is back and better than everfeaturing fun startegy and resource manegmentthis is the best in the classic strategy game seriesthe ideal game for thise who like strategy games
recommended
incredible must buy
recommended
this game has wrecked my sleeping pattern on many occasions historically accurate to build stonehenge in babylon and a great wall around mongolia 1010 would spend days dennouncing ghandi again
recommended
long and confusing but fun when use to
recommended
do not buy unless you want to waste 300 hours of your life playing an amazing game
recommended
its k not as good as lira but yeah
recommended
great game with unlimited replay value
recommended
totaly awesomethe gameplay is greatthe graphics are awesome and its just allaround epic
recommended
this was worth failing spanish
recommended
if youre reading this 20 years in the future for some odd reason scroll up and buy the game i dont even care if civ vi or civ vii has come out in that span of time you should still buy this and get addicted in the process
recommended
its reet gud
recommended
i play this way too much this is a great followup for the civ franchise the dlc is worth it at any price but you still get a great game without the dlc if you buy this youll get used to the hours flying by
recommended
this game is highley recommend for any one to who wants to play it
recommended
just as addictive as all the previous civilizations a wide variety of civilizations to pick from with different units and benefits that give you a slight edge in certain playstyles a worthy successor
recommended
not a bad game it is a real time passer
recommended
great game really timeconsuming though 1010
recommended
ive always enjoyed the civ franchise but they are soooo expensive i really reccomend waiting until the game and its expansions go on sale to purchase
recommended
ruin your life with one simple game
recommended
fun game as a person who is not that into strategy games its not too hard learn and is quite enjoyable
recommended
basically the best turn based strategy game ever if you like long extended games with multiple win conditions most of which do not even involve conquering this is the game for you
recommended
i love how immersive this game is just one more turn couldnt be more true i have over 100 games in my library but i keep coming back to this one
recommended
one more turn and ill write this comment
recommended
this game is absolutely incredible i have played over 233 hours of civilization v and i have enjoyed every second of it it is a highly indepth strategy game and despite having countless features and nuances they are all seamless every part of this game is intuitive and nothing seems even remotely out of place this is probably as close to perfect as the strategy genre has ever come
recommended
pretty all around outstanding
recommended
its an awsome strategy game
recommended
spent over 100 hours on this game easily one of the best strategy games ever
recommended
impressive game good graphics  much better than 4
recommended
this is one of my all time favorite games however please observe this warning this game is like crack if you have something you have to do in the next couple hours like sleep work take care of a child really anything that requires you to have some track of what time it is do not start a game personal example and reason im in the dog house came home after work around 10pm kissed the wife ate dinner decide to play a little civ v around 1030pm wife went to bed i started playing lost track of time and became extremely engrossed in the game the progression of my civilization which technology i should research next ghandi just nuked me so now i must exact revenge ghandi is gone now who is next on my list next thing i know my wife comes in the room and says are you really still playing the kid will be awake in 2 hours and you have to go to work in 6 hours what the hell is wrong with you my first reaction was there is no way ive been playing for 7 hours i checked the time and sure enough it had gotten way out of hand just remember to keep a clock somewhere nearby and within view if you are planning on playing this game
recommended
its like skyrim but with civilizations
recommended
awesome game very addictive
recommended
too many hours in this game just one more turn 
recommended
pretty good game
recommended
its addicting delete it from your computer before you flunk college
recommended
the true benchmark for turnbased strategy
recommended
civilization v is a very slow paced game that can take days to complete singleplayer is one of the most boring experiences i have had in a game grab a few friends to play with and this is a solid 810 very few glitches i found and tons of replayability for those casual gamers out there this is the way to go building your empire or knocking others down this is the best empire building game out there solo rating 410 multiplayer rating 810
recommended
this game is amazing it could not get ant better i heard there going to make a civ 6 cant wait
recommended
great game to waste your youth
recommended
810 glorious really although the concept of time needs to be addressed you need to have it in ample amounts to fully appreciate the creation
recommended
any multiplayer game lets you stab your friends in the back but only civ lets you keep pushing the same knife in deeper for weeks at a time
recommended
man this game was one of the first games i got on steam and i love it to bits the best part about it is the historical inaccuracies of it like discovering the nuke with the maya and bringing about the actual end of the world when you get bored of playing the game conventionally mods can completely change the feel of the game for me however i was playing the vanilla version of civ 5 for 100 hours i have no life so when i got gods and kingsbrave new world it was like a whole new game to explore i am still enjoying the game to this day and i most definately will buy the next sid meiers game on the lineup 6910  swaggy as   p
recommended
this game is realy fun
recommended
this game damn its good especially if you like strategy games warning highly addictive but if this going to be the first game you ever play you are gonna have a bad time
recommended
civ 5 is a game i recommend for many types of people strategy lovers risktype game lovers and history buffs alike should enjoy this game without even needing a review if youre on the edge about getting this game i encourage you to buy it its a very popular game for a very good reason i do warn however that if you enjoy fast fpslike action this is not the game for you the game is all about thinking and requires remembering certain complicated procedures of the game there are lots of menus lots of buttons and options and numbers that measure seemingly nothing which is a bit intimidating at first but i promise it gets a hell of a lot easier when you get into the mindset of a leader as a history buff i love the game for its accuracy its like a history teachers dream on steroids dont let the potential education value discriminate from the fact that this game is mindwashingly timewastingly fun be ready to spend hours on this game i lose many nights myself
recommended
i have put so much time into this game the civ series always delivers
recommended
if youre looking for an amazing strategy game to play with friends this is the way to go  takes a few games to get used to but eventually it can be really fun especially multiplayer
recommended
another excellent entry in the civilization franchise switching to a nostacking model is a big change but one the game pulls off expansions only improve the game buy all of them
recommended
you can build your own country run cities and declare war on other people sounds fun but youve got to manage your economy culture and other stuff like that but you get to nuke people so yes buy it
recommended
i have forgotten the sounds of birds and childrens laughter sunlight is a faint memory my friends have reported me missing and the neighbours have complained of the smell 1010rebuying for complete edition soon
recommended
its a fun game i enjoy it when i have nothing to do if youre interested in history youll probably like this even though its fun it has some technical problems 1 the ai sucks it does stupid moves and makes cities in 14 tiles islands with very limited resources you can go to multiplayer to fix this but multiplayer has its own share of problems 2 multiplayer is buggy and needs work sometimes you loose connection and there is a noticable delay even with low ping theres some other issues with it but im going to try to keep this review short 3 the game has long load times it takes 2 minutes to load to the main menu screen on my laptop 451 minute on my desktop if you have a ssd store this game on it itll help update recently aspyr ported this game to linux i have tried it and it suffers from some issues some fixable and some ignorable 4 if youre a linux user the game runs only in directx 9 mode other than that the port is really good surprisingly the game runs faster on linux compared to windows using the intel driver on the requirements it says that the intel hd 3xxx series wont work but i can confirm it does with a workaround there is artifacting text when the steam overlay is on just turn it off or set the overlay settings to low fixes the problem
recommended
an overall fun game with tons of replay value that is detrimented by the sheer amount of dlc if you didnt buy all the dlc from the getgo enjoy forking out a bunch of cash to be able to enjoy the full game or have fun in singleplayer since almost all multiplayer matches require dlc edit i managed to get two of the expansion packs and it makes the game more deep and enjoyable but i still think those who are suckered into buying any other version that the complete edition are going to be disappointed at the money they have to spend to fully enjoy the game still a great game
recommended
go to market and buy this game thats one of strategy games i like the most you need to conquer rome in 100 moves can you do it can your brain and eyes do that for you if yes go and buy this game i rate 1010
recommended
completly worth buying mass multiplayer with good instructions and a interactive singleplayer i recomend considering a dlc or two
recommended
one more turn @&
recommended
what can you say about one of the best series of true strategy games as with every version of civilization there are small changes which makes an old player a little annoyed but once you get used to the changes and get into the enhancements you know why you purchase every one of sid meiers branded games since the first civ  amazing game play single player multiplayer many different variations never the same game twice several difficult levels to challenge players of all skills levels defnitely one for the more intellectual gamers out there
recommended
civ 5 is one of those games that people who like the idea of owning their own empire will enjoy you can wage war with other nations and be happy with fruits of your conquests even though many risks were taken with dlc you can watch as your religion spreads across the world also for diplomats you can negotiate land resources and forge alliances i would recommend this game for people who have a lot of patience and time on their hands because this game is addicting as hell
recommended
first civilization game i have ever played i regret purchasing it and wasting my time on it my productivity has gone down and it takes many more turns in order for me to accomplish anything irl 1010

2 words ing awesome  just remember dont trust gandhi awesome gameplay god of rts speacial units makes it more awesome 9510 from me
recommended
a game where i can finally make china and japan fight a game where gandhi can drop 10 nukes on america just for the laughs 1010
recommended
this game is awesome i love how it takes time to build up and you can go from the primted to the very advanced the only thing i see weird in it is when the ai leaders denouce you for no reason when your already friendly with them besides that i think the game is perfect heres a tip when playing on two player make sure you have your food right next to you eatting it all day because thats how long the game takes to finsh i love and you will to
recommended
dont let your guard down especially raging barbarian they will always haunt you steal your worker raze your city and dont be friend with askia damn i still grudging him until now
recommended
this is an addictive turnbased strategy game that will keep you at your computer for hours at at time i always find myself saying ill play just one more turn then ill get off then i find myself playing 1520 more turns before i finally pull myself away this is because theres always something interesting happening during every turn and you feel the need to take advantage of it this game also has low specifications so you dont need a super fast computer to play it fun immersive historical and captivating  definitely worth the price

this is a history fanatics dream game and i love it
recommended
i would say this is a great predessor of the good old civ 4 i have good memories of civ 4 and this does not disappoint there might be some historical unaccuracies such as nuke happy gahndi but still i can not say that makes this game bad if anything you should deffinetly buy this game to play you do not have to depend on multiplayer to find something fun to do in this game because you can do so much in it without anybody else with you there are so many diffrent ways to play to get victory other than war you can be a cultural based civ diplomatic or even my personal favorite buy yourself victory buy this game 1010
recommended
it should be slavery as a social policy and i cant understand why some evil historical rulers like hitler stalin vlad the impaler arent there genghis khan was an absolutely bloodthirsty ruler and i can play him as a pacifist its just a game nevertheless civ5 is maybe the best strategy game ever produced its real fun to control all aspects of a civilization such as economics religion military
recommended
this is the best 4x game ever
recommended
great entry in the franchise
recommended
ive only played a little bit but 1010 ign seriously gg
recommended
great game huge bush
recommended
amazing game you will have lots of fun even if you lose you will want to keep on playing
recommended
excellent strategy game for beginners and veterans alike eight difficulty levels allow players to finetune their difficulty levels and user created mapsciv packages allow for ridiculous replayability excellent community on the web for single player and multiplayer dlc is reasonably priced and goes on sale often firaxis could patch balance issues a little more frequently but its still pretty balanced for the most part
recommended
ever since alpha centuri ive been looking for a simalar game that is more updated and can actually play multiplayer civ 5 comes close but alpha centuri still wins im afraid but dont think that this isnt an awesome game it is still one of the best games in my inventory
recommended
the best strategy gamesseries one of the best games will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours puts the best of military strategy together with things like cultural and technological strategy and adds diplomacy a little lacking but game play makes up for it to create one of if not the best games i have ever played the internal improvements such as wonders and buildings and choosing how to shape your civilization towards a certain victory condition even adds to the strategy throw in the goty edition along with g&k and bnw and you have a highly developed and emerged strategy game that will give you thousands of hours of entertainment each civilization gives you a completely different experience and there are hundreds upon hundreds of combinations you can try the dlc may get a little pricey and the ai has some issues but it is still by far one of my favorite games
recommended
this game lets you act out your anger on the chinese by building a mass army and taking over their cities and renaming them stuff like land of the small weewees 1010 goty
recommended
great game played over 140 hours and loving it d
recommended
this is a great game kys if u think otherwise
recommended
my go to game i love this game
recommended
want a strategy game thats not too compex id say civ v fits the mold you essentially face off against ai or human players to become the best real world nationempire in a made up earthlike planet scenarios such as the mongols developing cultural superiority swedes conquering the world and the mayans sending the first man to the moon can happen all of which resulting in victory for that civilization compared to other strategy games civ v may not have as much depth as other strategy games including civ iv and there are many features that could be added or improved upon but thats not to say that its a mindless game you need to manage your cities and armies and your empire overall well if you wish to win ive spent hours upon hours playing this game and it still sparks my interests if you do buy civ v id suggest buying the gold edition on sale the game itself plus all of the dlc that goes with it is expensive but ive seen the gold edition which has all but one piece of the games dlc go on sale for about $12 if you see that deal and you like strategy games that arent too complex then take it
recommended
this game is great for buying wives losing them in the forest and finding them slayn by internet trolls that look like vin deisal
recommended
play dis  ma n1gg4 kick some  launch some nukes take over some other civilizations pillage & plunder or have peaceful relationships with other civs and swipe them in a cultural or science win 9810 multiplayer can be buggy
recommended
i recommend this game to everyone who likes strategyboard games it feels like playing a board game but much more fun go buy now
recommended
addictive and well made cant wait for the next civ
recommended
the next installation in sid meiers civilization series of games civilization v is a wonderful turnbased strategy game in which players can forge the history of an earthlike world as they rule it augustus caesar may declare war on george washington catherine the great may find that her cities are being bombed by mahatma gandhi initially met with some criticism over how it plays in comparison to its numerical predecessor civilization iv civ v is still an excellent game that is improved immensely by its dlc please note that anyone buying dlc may be better off buying only brave new world rather than brave new world and gods and kings as brave new world adds everything added in gods and kings save for a few civilizations if you enjoy turn based strategy games with a focus on decisive victories through conquest culture diplomacy or science you certainly can not go wrong with civilization v
recommended
awesome game im actually adicted
recommended
this is really an upgrade from the old versions the complexity and multitudes in achieving victory combined with the different civilizational aspects provides an extreme diversity in each game the multiplayer experience is really the pinnacle of what started as civnet this game is truly enjoyable in the company of friends in multiplayer mode
recommended
i have loved the civilization series bbuuuttt spending most of my time on civ 4 logging thousands of hours then playing civ 5 there is a huge gap and its so different im not saying its bad change alot of the new stuff i was looking for in civ4 but i personally feel that if civ 4 and civ 5 had a baby it would be a perfect game p i have a hard time transitioning between the 2 games now but i do love how the game can be different every time and if your like me you like to have more fun then is ment to have with these games to create a story out of this sooo addictive game i do enjoy how you can make a defensive line and hold back the enemy instead of in civ 4 where making a line of troops are so easy to cut through due to stacking troops which over all i love stacking troops the nukes are sooooo over powering builds a couple and can decimate any army in your path i really love how there is actually a set number of resources and many different ways to spend it so you have to think ahead instead of just spamming troops with no limit besides gold  also compared to civ 4 instead of the ai spamming catapults they need to build normal troops it is definitly improved from civ 4 and would definitly recrommend and really meets needs of how some of the newish games are but always remember clicking the button is half the fun
recommended
played with friends tried to be neutral one friend starts giving me troops other friend nukes me as a safety precaution 1110
recommended
only worth buying if you can get the entire thing  all dlcs massively discounted its good fun dont get me wrong but theyve basically made a decent game then broken it into parts to milk all the money they can from the franchise civ5 base  g&k  bnw  a decent game and worth buying in a bundle at 11
recommended
i think i have a problem just got the game today already played 11 hours i have friend wait correction i had friends 1010
recommended
i love this game it has an amazing progression system and tech tree a lof of units and many unique to certain leaders giving you incentive to play all of the factions
recommended
one does not simply play this game for less than half an hour in one sitting
recommended
civilization v is altogether a great game that i recommend everyone should play
recommended
best game of all time
recommended
got denounced by america for promoting international games 1010 for realism
recommended
one of the best games ever if you have a nice group of friends to play with me and my pals play all the time worth the buy also note you do not need gold to get brave new world
recommended
love it you all should play this great game
recommended
great game that you can play multiple times and each time is different
recommended
this game is good everyone should buy it
recommended
buy this so you can play with me pls
recommended
the game is amazing very difficult to tear yourself away once you get going the expansion packs are highly recommended as well
recommended
if you dont own this game you should
recommended
what can you say about civ v if you dont already have thisbuy it addictive as anything and so much fun yes its an rts but the turns dont get in the way you will want to win on each and every civilization available
recommended
this is a very entertaining game i find it very challenging though that may say more about me as a player than it does about the game its a very good game from a genre i dont typically enjoy
recommended
get itend of story
recommended
great fun game lots of flexibility and never gets old
recommended
fairly dank
recommended
it is a very very very great turn based sratagy games and the creators did a formidable job on it 1
recommended
this is one of my favorite games ever if you dont have this game something is wrong with you
recommended
this is a pretty dense strategy game so many things to customize from rainfall to world age and at least a dozen playable characters hours will be spent playing this game if you like it im sure you will
recommended
wasnt really into turnbased strategy games but this is really good
recommended
since playing 98 hours of civ5 i have learnt two things 1 trust noone 2 make sure you check the time at some point because youve probably been playing this game for 12 hours straight buy it now
recommended
stock up on the hot pockets and mountain dew
recommended
a horribly addicting game hours upon hours lost to this game
recommended
just one more turn great its been 4 hours
recommended
>playing single player >ghandi goes to war with me >cries >2 or 3 barbarian armys come out of nowhere and attack me >cries harder
recommended
from what i played of this game it is a very good 4x however i would recomend picking up brave new world along with the game as it sorts out a few problems the game had on launch however if you like playing with more sinarios and civs then you could pick up gods and kings for a few new bits of content the changes that where made to cultural victorys make a lot more sense as in previous civ games it was a little too easy to mass produce culture in citys and slowly but surely take over the world not to mention you can now pick which religion you adopt and can add perks to help you with the type of victory you would like to accoplish and lastly the big change and the most welcome from my perspective battles they had to be the most frustrating thing about the previous game as tons of eneimes could inhabit the same tile as each other making seeing what was coming at you a nightmare not anymore though and thankfully with the addition of ranged units that can attack without being attacked themselfs it makes combat incredibley fun and strategic and no need to worry about a stray bandit coming in and taking over a city as they now have health that needs to be taken down before they can be captured so if you are looking for a knew game to waste some precious hours on i see no reason why this one cant be for you
recommended
omg so epic much stategy such wow
recommended
i love this game out of all 53 games in my library civilization v is my favorite its so easy to learn and understand its also very addictive there have been many mornings where ive needed to get up at 8 am and still be up at 4 or 5 am playing this game the mod support is also incredible a lot of extra civilizations have been added for extra gameplay theres also a ton of extra maps to download and play too i would also recommend getting the brave new world expansion when its on sale it adds a lot to the game one of the best things about it is the international trading that comes in the expansion it gives you a lot of extra gold civ v is awesome buy it
recommended
its i very interesting strategy game it is a lot of fun but it takes a lot of time to finish one game
recommended
1010 will have to take history exam again
recommended
i used logically irresistible methods and initiatives grounded in cooperation friendship and paternalism in the name of the righteouslyguided godemperor to reluctantly yet out of necessity annex under ethically restrained duress the entire continent which composed the egyptian empire into my greater east asian coprosperity sphere working together we shall strive to protect the far east which includes northeast africa from the savage and insatiable barbarian greed and aggression which inevitably results from western imperialism and all of its various excesses and immoralities i also made anime into an entire religion by implying that it wasnt one already 3810 i guess its okay  mr haha funnymaymay ign
recommended
scumbag ghandi kill him yearly when you reach riflemen and he still has medieval units also watch for napoleon  he likes to fight  bring units close to his borders to slow him down
recommended
why should you buy this game you can create a personality cult religion you can nuke people you dont like you can send rockets into spehss you can burn cities and lands you also build stuff
recommended
enormous amounts of diversity tactical strategies and historical anachronisms delightful game
recommended
eh pretty good
recommended
a very weak recomadation as it has poor mulitplayer i belive it has been patched but not tested it but when it works its great fun waring with friends and ai is pretty good when you put the diffuctiy up there is no cobbled story element which is great for all of its flaws it has many great redeming features and truly a must have pc game
recommended
its a great game the only problem is that you always want to play and sometimes a match takes several hours
recommended
play its cheap and can last you a long time
recommended
i never thought that civilization v would be something i enjoyed it was a gift from my husband and i gave it a shot only to humor him yet somehow it entranced me for ten hours straight that first play i love it great for people who are history fans like me the game play is smooth and easy to understand and is far more addicting than it may appear
recommended
out of all of the time wasters on earth sid meiers civilization v is probably the best and most effective
recommended
i literally had to force myself to stop playing
recommended
civilization is a fantastic game and has a wide variety of choices and different paths to go you are able to see the start of a civilization and then you can see the end of your civilization in an armada of nukes this game has everything
recommended
i mistakenly bought this game before conversion to local value and without sale discounts no regrets 1510
recommended
great game
recommended
[wonder you were building] has been built in a far off land wrrooowwn
recommended
im pretty new to the pc genere as i got my laptop this christmas and i also have never reviewed a game before that being said i have to say even though i havent played the game as long as most usually play it its easy to see why this game has so much critical acclaim im only on turn 135 and im hooked the game makes me feel like im actually a conqueror or i can be a diplomat or i can partner up with another civilization and take down an opponent thats been giving both of us trouble the choices on how you take over the world are endless i love how your opponents are given real world historic leaders as their avatars and you get one too each avatar is random unless you set it otherwise and each has their own special ability and traits this entire review has been about the single player version of the game i havent even tried multiplayer yet but i plan on it soon i love this game and cant wait to delve into it soon 1010 with the non official badass seal of approval
recommended
warmongering ghandi has ruined my life
recommended
more addictive than heroin
recommended
this is a game where you control your empire and nuke the bejesus out of whatever the heck you want but watch out for nations like the peace loving india they will tank the crap out of you and stick you on the end of their tank barrels for entertainment 1110 would get death roboted by persia
recommended
very much recommended can seem boring at firstespecially if you arent familiar with the series earlier games but once you get into it theres no going back d deep and addictive gameplay
recommended
smashingly brilliant
recommended
i was first introduced to civilization on ps3 after playing it and having a blast conquering the game i started looking for ports of it on the pc at this pivitol moment i had discovered civiliazation 5 along with steam playing this game  as a person who loves rts games and grew up with commmand and conquer and other such games i had a near instant gamegazm and almost creamed myself metaphorically speaking the lush deep and imersive strategy along with slew of subjective style winscenarios technology culture domination etc was great the choices for leaders and empires is also well diversed and colourful in its own right this game is very addictive and with all the dlc thats available for it makes it truly one of greats if i were to say anything bad about this game it would have to be that my computer is not good enough to run it in its full glory my rating for this is 1010
recommended
solo or with a group this is a fantasticly in depth game
recommended
>boot up civ 5 at 7pm >multiplayer >host game >invite friends >start game > >5am
recommended
as a loooong time civ player i was a little underwhelmed by the inital civ v offering though it was a good base but with the first expansion it achieves a lof the potential i had hoped for awesome game theres a reason so many people are always playing it
recommended
civ v keeps me from playing my other games it is so good and soo fun endless replayability it will turn you into a tactical city building fan
recommended
great game but if you play against meill probably nuke you
recommended
one of the most educational games ever
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
this is a great game
recommended
great strategy game looking forward to the next one in the series
recommended
luv this game so much recomend to anyone if you love any type of stategy even if you arent into turn based it is soooooo adicting definitly get the complete edition definitely worth it you could hate video games and fall in love with civ v
recommended
easily one of the best games ive ever played i played this game on single player for days without getting bored and could play it almost endlessly with friends on multiplayer
recommended
amazing game gameplay time lasts for 100 of hours and the game improves greatly with the expansion packs g&k and bnw so you can replay again and again and againand again
recommended
my friend took newyork from me so i couldnt have the fountin of youth decided he didnt want the fountin so he razed the city and demanded 2 gold and 1 horse for a peace between our nations 1010 would lose again
recommended
1010 would nuke civs three eras behind in technology again
recommended
this game can become very addicting
recommended
this game makes my netherregions very confused 1010
recommended
good game but fix fuking multiplayer
recommended
played a little bit
recommended
this is an amazing series and this game is the epitome of it you definately need to play sorry for my poor spelling 
recommended
i love this game espically the mutiplayer it is so fun to get a bunch of friends together and play this game with them i recommed this 100% to anyone
recommended
civ v is the type of game you play with the intention of finishing in 20 minutes civ v then laughs at you and makes you kneel before it as you play until dawn civilization 5 is an amazing game it reminds me of when i used to play command and conquer zero hour civ v is packed to the brim with content every time you play you learn something new if you have some money you should definitely pick up civ v next time it goes on sale
recommended
i have been playing the civilization series since the late 1980s when i had it for my atari st and msdos the series has remained true to its roots all along civilization v has continued in that tradition i can highly recommend this game i have not yet spent any time in multiplayer and more than likely wont very often if at all not because of the game but because i prefer to play solo the ui and control is well done graphics and sounds also very well done the fact that it has user made content support via the workshop is a huge boost to the game options makes it infinatly replayable with that new content so far the 2 things that i do not like is the fact you can not stack units which makes it tough to overwealm an enemy city or fortification the other thing i do not like is the fact that land units can move across the sea without having to board sips to me it kind of dumbs down that part of the game and takes some of the challenge away in previous versions of civilization you had to have ships to transport units across the sea overall the game is a lot of fun and in the end that all that really matters would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed the earlier versions or who enjoys strategic games
recommended
meh not that good but worth a shot
recommended
not much else needs to be said after you see that ive played this game for almost 700 hours since it came out im a huge fan of civilization and have played every iteration since the first each has built upon the last and i cant wait to see if there will be a civ vi sometime in the near future a turn based strategy classic that will remain in my top 5 of all time
recommended
let the confederate take charge
recommended
great global strategy of all time
recommended
to start off i feel i should issue a warning this game is incredibly addictive if you have the patience for it i personally think its a game you either love or hate within the first few hours of play for those of you like me who have given it a chance beyond those few hours of engaging enjoyment you got hooked and most likely will end up investing an absolute tonne of hours into civ 5 making it well worth the money civ is one of the best turn based strategy games i have played on top of that the extra dlc specifically gods and kings and a brave new world add a fair bit to the game and i would suggest them as a good accompanying purchase basic breakdown of the game is you choose your world leaderrace each with unique skills that tend to fit them decently well compared to their historic counterparts next you settle upon new land of your choosing begin earning production points science points faith points gold etc to make your city grow and branch out to make new cities in land further away as you discover more and more of the map youve been given seems simple not quite you have constant pokes from barbarians and barbarian camps hostile countries and city states you can try to win them over and steamroll other opponents or try and squish each and every single city you happen to come across the choice is really yours a few things that really stand out for me is the fact that it allows a lot of leway for different playstyles something of which i utterly love i enjoy when a game doesnt make these invisible little hallways to make sure you only walk in that and only that direction per say it lets you freely make your own mistakes or victories another point i will happily give it is that all maps are randomly generated adding even more content and depth for the game as you never know what youre going to be thrown you could start on a map that will only give you a lot of production upfront or one that gives you a lot of gold or maybe one that already has luxury resources its all up to chance and another point it hands down warrants is for the incredible voice acting and languages they are impeccable graphics for a lot of top down rts games that i have played dont seem to leave much room for detail civ5 blows most if not all of the others out of the water with their attention to detail zooming in closer to your map and cities are a joy and if that all werent enough the work put into making all the character details histories traits and historically accurate backgrounds for wonders and characters are remarkable now in saying that this is not a history simulator do not come into this thinking it will all be 100% historically accurate doing so would be incredibly difficult and would in turn not make it sid meiers civ due to how ais would play you have accurate backgrounds and info files for world wonders natural wonders and all leaders thats about it ai will not react exactly like they would have back however many years mind you i only add this in here as i have actually heard a few complaints about it however its major failings lie within the ai now if youre not constantly playing against someone in a pvp duel you have nothing but the ai to deal with this can be a bit of a headache as they end up with unfair advantages such as finding an abundance of luxury resources all the time no matter the difficulty if youre just starting out on civ this can be a quite daunting put off if you are a civ veteran youll see even more flaws even within the trading system it will sometimes bug never coming out to a fair trade or even worse not giving you anything for what youve offered wanting to sus out what you would get for a certain trade most of the time wont work no matter how much or how little the bot can have in its inventory all in all though it is an incredible game well worth its weight in goldsee what i did there with how many hours you will end up investing into it
recommended
great game 
recommended
12 hours a game gr8 with friends but will get mad if they take forever to end their turn 69

recommended
noice really noice 
recommended
this game never gets old its very easy to log in 100 hrs cant wait to play beyond earth 910
recommended
great
recommended
do not play if youve promised yourself just 20 minutes for that will pass in a blink of an eye civ 5 maybe the most recent the most expansive and potentially most daunting of the classic civilization series  reinforced with a 234page manual that comes with it with those factors in mind its easy to imagine strategy newcomers running away from civ 5 in droves but give it another look please civ 5 is the culmination of over 20 years of series development each game has been better than the last which is a feat in itself  and welcomes both seasoned veterans and newbies alike the devs have beavered away on features that worked and ditched those that players felt weak however the single most impressive attribute about civ 5 is the ability to play the game how you want to play it want to be a peaceloving pacifist society you can be want to be a total powermongering and ruthless despot again your choice i wish i had more space to promote this buy it  910
recommended
its boring historically an inaccurate mess not immersive and slow paced as all hell also one of the greatest damn strategy games ive played and know it to be the best ill play for long until civ vi that is supports a ton of playstyles and even losing a game would not bother as its incredibly fun to just build and develop your empire also watch out starting it once means all of your games will dust in your steam library for the next one to four weeks
recommended
a game for people like me who have a craps load of time to create a civilization anyway its a lot of fun try it out
recommended
civilization v an indepth stategy game with historical figures and events sid meier knows stategy and when there are at times over 90000 people still playing civ v to this day you see the proof how well this stategy game is made stategy games have always been my take a break from the shooter games civ v is the best of that break if there is one strategy game to buy civ v is it is it your time to jump in to history and have the control
recommended
great gamethis game will have you say yeah ill play for a little bit and there you are 5 hours later and you keep saying one more turnone more turn
recommended
this may be too adictive for some people but it is so worth it
recommended
never before have i played a game as majestic as this the graphics are simply amazing the soundtrack immerses you in the whole experience and its the kinda game where you sit down to play and the next thing you know its 4 am
recommended
my dad and i used to play chess my son and i play civilization its the new strategy game
recommended
awesome d best strats game i have ever played d 10 outta 10
recommended
awesome game just be careful not to start playing if you need to do anything else that day and absolutely do not start playing if you would like to sleep anytime soon highly addictive beautiful graphics and an awesome community if you havent already check out the civfanatics forum [forumcivfanaticscom] for strategies mods and more
recommended
civilazations has always been one of my favorite games do what you want command armies or grow a culture the world will never forget research technology and race to be the first to build monuments to your own greatness civilizations is a game where every move you make from the insignificant to the vital changes the game and writes the story there are no crappy one or the other ethical decisions in this game you choose what is right you write the ethics and judge only yourself five ramps all of that up a notch adding cultural bonuses and legitimate cultural gameplay at least with brave new world if youre new to civ this is a great game to get started on if youve played civ before this game is going to present new options new challenges and a whole new way to write your story truely a masterpiece of modern strategy
recommended
civilization v is like if risk and a tycoon had a baby no i have no idea what im talking about just play it
recommended
what can i say about this game if youve ever played previous iterations of this game i started with civilization ii then youre probably already addicted and own it for newcomers i think firaxis have done an amazing job simplifying the ui and providing useful prompts for new mechanics as they appear so this is a great version to start with even with the simplifications all the depth youd expect from this game is still there and you can expose it easily the city management screen for example with the gods & kings and brave new world dlc firaxis have made what i think is by far the most entertaining civilization yet so to summarise buy this game if you have any love for strategy and a w streak just be prepared to lose entire days to it
recommended
this is a game you can easily lose a day too 4x games always look incredibly boring too watch but once you start playing one you just cant stop gods and kings and brave new world are pretty much required too get as the base game was a little too basic the five different victroy types make finding new strategys all the more fun
recommended
its great
recommended
i whole heartedly love this game the first day i got it i spent the whole day with my friend playing it stayed up till 6 am this game is one of my top 10 its easy to pick up and play the games are long but you can change settings to make it shorter this games makes me feel like the creator had the consumer in mind while creating this game 910
recommended
i really enjoy the coop of this game my brother and i play as often as we can
recommended
i dont understand how this game can be one of the most popular strategy games its shit im not kidding awful hexagonestyle gameplay didnt like it at all but i have to admit that in the beginning when i first tried it out i liked the diplomacy aspect of the game the rest no so much
recommended
one of the best 4x strategy games out there
recommended
one of the best turnbased strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player this is one game that any strategy enthusiast or hell anyone stratcurious should check out
recommended
very very fun game now if you dont like aoe and risk type games you wont like this if you do you will love this you just have to remember its like risk with turns thats about all its like aoe because you have to get resources ectectect its not like either of those in the ways of creating a city attacking trading and research well its kinda a tiny tiny bit like aoe with the research its like aoe with the cant see anything to start withor at least tell you get a satalite  then its like you typed marco polo its like risk cuase you it takes turn kinda like drafting but not its like aoe cuase you see your troops but you have sections you can move a amount you can move and other things all in all i loved the game would buy it again if that meant playing it and winningagain  thanks
recommended
none of my friends want to play this game with me anymore which is a shame becauase this is a beast of a multiplayer if your lucky enough to have cooperative friends cherish every moment with them in this game
recommended
great turn based game always end up spending more time playing than i wanted to
recommended
this game is very realistic the japanese first started in north america where they were at constant odds with their neigbours russia and songhai they managed to conquer them all and set across the seas where they setteled in modern day europe where they also met geroge washington and the arabs the arabs were very strong and conquering everyone including america so then japan libertaed america from their arab opperssors but the americans decided to invade japan with its longswords men but they were no match against the japanese giant death robots
recommended
the zulu kept calling me punyso i nuked them 1010would nuke again
recommended
dont buy this game unless you have the sparetime for it youll get hooked for hours  even considering staying home from work to play just one more turn
recommended
civilization v is by itself a good game but not the best in the series civilization v with the two expansions gods and kings and brave new world turns this game into by far the most addicting and streamlined entry yet engaging in border disputes tech stealing and global commerce are vary satifying unless you are the one being exploited
recommended
this game includes hours of fun and helps you learn about history
recommended
just one more turn is what youll end up saying to your self cant wait to try playing this with the steam controller while sitting on the couch
recommended
it may be simpler than earlier civ games but it makes up for that in refinement many mechanics are missing but that ones that are here are very fun to use multiplayer is also fun in a lan you will not mind its flaws when you actually start playing it though as you will be immersed in a heavily addictive game just one more turn
recommended
be warned this game is a drug

this is the best turnbased strategy game you will ever play and its not that expensive either nudge nudge

this is a very good game i have nothing bad to say about it it is one of the best turn based games ive played and have nothing bad to say about it in my experiences
recommended
this game is akin to heroin also you can play with one hand this is critical because i can still play while holding my infant son
recommended
civilization v is the most realistic strategy games i have ever played with smart ai trading and politic aspect this game adds up to be the perfect strategy simulator as you age from cavemen to towering robots every thing you do creates a story in it self
recommended
intelligent gaming at its finest
recommended
a quite addicting 4x that has a fair amount of factions to pick from would recommend to but the complete edition because it feels somewhat incomplete without the dlc
recommended
you will invest many hours into this game
recommended
excellent strategy definatly a good sit down game when you have lots of free time and willing friend to join you

top 10 things to know 1 ghandi happiness and peace thermonuclear warfare and death for everyone 2 war is best 3 only make the game last for a long time if you want the ai to hate you 4 the ai declares war for no good reason 5 onemoreturn 6 ceasarextreme backstabberi think he wants what was don to him to happen to everyone 7 dem stealth bombers tho 8 dem nukes tho 9 prepare to pledge your life to the allpowerful nextturn button 10 backstabbing simulator 20something serious review this is a great 4x strategy game and if thats what youre looking for buy it it has a fully functional multiplayer as well as singleplayer you essentially play as different civilizations from history and try to win using various different methods which are explained in the tutorial
recommended
the game is well designed but with some minor problems for some peoples connection while in multiplayer single player is good
recommended
wow this game this entire franchise is simply genius it seems like such a simple topic at first and like so many other dominate the world through firstperson mrated combat games but once you start playing you realize that its far more indepth and dynamic and just plain addictive than those plus it isnt rated m that ability to bo one of the best games in my opinion like minecraft terraria and the zoo tycoon franchise all of which i love is really a pretty herculean task in a world dominated by violenceaddicted teens who would love nothing more than to lop a strangers head off way to go sid

i was a day 1 purcahser of vanilla civ v my initial imprassion was that it was a hollow game and it did not contrast well with civ iv and civ ii i recently picked up civ v complete and have put quite a few hours into it including a marathon pangea on prince with 22 civs on standard it was a one more turn experience which prompted me to change my review to positive the good hexes they obsolete all previous games audiovisual especialy the impressionistic art the leaderheads and the great works the religion system is really good the trade system is good the bad the culture system is not a dynamic as it was in civ iv likewise civics were more intuitive than policies the ugly the ai cannot fight one unit per tile the two are linked in my mind
recommended
civilization 5 is a well made strategic game with very nice graphics it is hard to understand in the beginning but if you invest time into reading about the game then it wont take long to understand it it is also fun because a game is never the same and there are many ways to victory to discover there are a lot of characters with each their own bonuses and there are also a lot of ways to play the game you can play it with agression and win by war or you can go the more peaceful way and try to get a science victory the game gives great support while playing and also has its own kind of guide book in it the only thing people might find troubling is that this game takes a lot of your time one small sized game can often take 6 hours so the bigger games will definetly cost more time one thing i personally like about this game is that it also has a lot of history in it you get to see a lot of art works from great artists and you get to know how curtain object came in this world like the atom bomb it also has some really nice quotes in it and even some music pieces from old musicians i really recommend this game if you like a lot of strategy and thinking it is not the normal build your own city kind of game so dont go into this game with that thought it is not like the anno games from ubisoft or the setler games
recommended
addicting
recommended
very fun game many great features in the expansion pack so make sure you get the whole thing if you are thinking of buying this game the situations are fun and multiplaayer works great citizen managment can be confusing and hard to master the best combination for specific situations and times so dont mess with that unless you know what you are doing every thing else is great and easy to learn all the leaders are great and fun to play as and against great game and worth every penny

you have been warned one more turn ends up becoming a few hundred more

rewarding infinite replayability best turn based strategy ive ever played 1010

amazing game each new version of the game brings more and more stuff
recommended
to build a civilization from scratch and pace out human history is completely worth the 1033 hours ive devoted to playing this game i fully intend to play this game for at least a thousand more hours 1010
recommended
i love this game plain and simple i got the complete edition for $25 dollars during a steam sale and damn i dont regret it with the dlc the game has a plethora of civs to play as along with better mechanics and features than vanilla civ 5 each civ in the game has their own unique abilty unique unitunique buildingunique improvement there are 5 victory types time based whoever has the most points at turn 500 diplomatic winning the world leader vote in the un cultural having your culture being influencial on all others science build spaceship parts to go populate another planet and domination take all other capital cities civ 5 will suck you in especially if you like turned based strategy games already and history theres a large amount of map types to build your civilization in from a fractal earth to the actual globe theres a map type for everyone each ai also plays differently based on their historic counterparts gandhi is peaceful the aztecs are warmongers etc so a bit of knowledge of history can help you or you cna learn more about history by playing pretty cool total reccomendation even to people on the fence about it try it see if you like it love it lose your life to it also poland can into space
recommended
buy it play it done nothing else needs to be said

ive played civ5 since i joined steam and played it for over 420 hours it was worth every second most dlc is worth purchasing when on sale the actual gameplay is awesome you can be a warmongerous scientific political religous or culture based civilization or mix of all plenty of civilizations and units to choose from especially in the dlcs and expansion packs the workshop and mods for this game is one of the best in a game i have seen a bit on the expensive side especially considering in civ4 all of the features that were realesed as dlc for civ5 were already included in civ4 graphics are beautiful gameplay is fun and challenging steam trading cards and achievments as well as a brilliant modding community 9510

sid meiers civilization v is possibly one of the best stratergy games that you will ever come across it topped all civs before it and is even better than beyond earth you could be sat there saying to yourself just a quick game the next thing you know youve spent over 5 hours of your life and jumped over 200 turns this game is a must buy
recommended
i do not know how to describe civ v except for amazing this rts game may be slow moving but its stratagy is beyond compare civ v incorporates history and gaming in a way that makes it one of the greatest games ive played
recommended
one of my favorites when you first start the game you can hardly stop you can choose a famous leader from throughout the time and each have it speciality and you choose how you will conquer the world by by war by politic or science and more its all up to you this game is a must prepare to be consumed for hours d 1010 <3
recommended
this game is amazing to the point of rebuilding great empires or civilizations and breaking them down to control the world
recommended
civ 5 is one the best stradegy games i have played in a while it will take you many hours to complete a game and there are hundreds of hours of replayablity the multiplayer also works well if you are trying to find a new stradegy game that you can spend a lot of time in look no farther
recommended
one of the most fun and all consuming games ive had the pleasure of playing from holding a small mountain pass against multiple waves napoleans cavelry all 300 style with a single group of spearmen to fostering new trade agreements with the egyptions across the sea this game is fun you sit down thinking oh just a few turns then ill save and make some dinner but the next thing you know its 4am and you need to be in to work for 6am simple mechanics that are easy and fun to learn multiple ways to win from the classic rts plan of kill everyone to the more complex cultural and tourrism victory tons of replay value as every game plays out diffrently
recommended
if you have 1 day to live dont play civ v it will take those 24 hours and crush them there is no game more addicting than this
recommended
love this game i deffintly recomend buying the complete pack it is stupid to just buy civilization v with no dlc
recommended
one of the best strategic games of this era best replacement for chess in decades 
recommended
this game was my very first turnbased game and i have to say its worth the money even the dlc sadly it removed some of the qualities from civ 4 for all you oldies but its still a new and awesome game thats worth playing the dlc is what adds more to the game making it better strategy wise and especially fun with friends the multiplayer is much better with the improvised patches that help make it better and smoother the craziest part about this game is that they can last weeks if you play on marathon mode with friends or a bunch of ai the ai decision making is not the best but its feasible and they can make some suprising actions no matter how long you play ive been playing this game for nearly 2 years and it still never gets old even with friends and new content made by the fans at the workshop ill continue to play it every now and then and in my eyes is considered classicworthy material its hell of a lot better than civbe the worst possible thing is playing a marathon match with 12 ai playing as bismarck in the year 3422 with ghandi and all of a sudden you get nuked near the end and lose it all all two weeks of progress to dominate the world cultrually scientifically forcefully or diplomatically
recommended
this game is fantastic i play it with my friends and the internet and solo all of the time i highly recomend it to anybody who ikes a good turn based stratagy game
recommended
a good game indeed i r8 th8 88 m8

recommended
gosh i cant get enough of this game
recommended
very addictive and fun
recommended
if you want to rule the worldand raise your empire this game is for you
recommended
super fun war game playing with friend is the best way to play this game but is still reccomendable on single player build up cities upon cities of foundation on your civilisation and watch is thrive or be destroyed be superior forces great game only problem is tabbing out is super laggy and also the steam severs are of poor qualty on this game would reccomend creating own server 910
recommended
an excellent addition to the civ series streamlines a lot of micromanaging uses hexes instead of squares and has a totally overhauled for civ and awesome combat system not quite up to alpha centauri levels of greatness but superb nevertheless on balance better than civ iv i say this as a former civ iv addict
recommended
civilization is like the best its so relaxing to just have it your own pace and i am only writing this because is have too
recommended
favorite game of alltime
recommended
this game has so many ways to play its ridiculous you can play as a warmongering america or you can play as a cultural germany or a scientific iroquois the game is easy to pick up if you put a little time into it the game runs clean and smooth on nearly everythng and for a over the top strategy game its awfully pretty too multiplayer games can get very intense if youve a friend who has this game great for lan parties because anything can happen 9510 only problem is it can get a bit gltchy in multiplayer with loading but only vanilla civ v has this problem definitely recommend getting the dlcs when they go on sale
recommended
1010 thumbs up
recommended
one of the best stratagie games ever made
recommended
greatest game known to man period ill cut anyone who says different
recommended
nice game it will let you to understand real historical actions wars coups etc and you will have a great time especially playing with friends 
recommended
great game
recommended
its funbut only with brave new world
recommended
different than civ 4 but not necessarily in bad ways great way to sink a couple hundred hours though >>
recommended
amazing game very well directed and the music is fabulous i would give it a 910
recommended
delivers as expected a must have for any civ player
recommended
its a awsome game i like how there is no adds that pop up while you are playing i like all the different civs
recommended
hours of fun and fustration waiting for your turn lol great game
recommended
excellent game especially after the 2 expansions lots of great civs and they are really unique best played with friends but single player is just as good if you dont have the game make sure to get the complete edition when it goes on sale for like 7 dollars or so highly recommend
recommended
really when it comes down to it you probably already know this game is awesome and you either a havent tried it or b know its awesome from personal experience give it a go if you havent especially if turnbased stratcitybuilders seem kinda interesting to you tha major difference ive found between civ 5 and its predecessor civ 4 is that civ 5 is really clunky and boring without all the dlc i played standalone civ 4 for countless hours civ 5 simply didnt click with me until i bought the dlc at the urging of a friend moral of the story is buy the game and all the dlc during a sale its worth it
recommended
for a long time i used to hear stuff about this game there is a big joke online about ll play 1 more turn and 10 hours pass or i play until i realise its 7am and i have to go to work and for a long time i thought it was funny but never really understood it until i bought the game its phenomenal and many times when i go to save i realise that i wasnt saving 15 minutes later but 3 hours later my 1st session ended exactly as the jokes i have heard so many times on forums and in steam reviews i do have to note that this is the kind of strategy that is tailored exactly for my tastes so i got hooked immediately i highly recommend this im just having fun and learning the ropes with the base civ v i dont even have the expansions yet and i hear they make the game 10x times better you can always jump in for a world conquest and enjoy hours of fun the amount of playtime you can get out of this is insane just pure value for money this game is a huge bargain <3 1010
recommended
585 hours played out of 5 stars
recommended
this game omg
recommended
this is a great historical city builder that you half to get your hands on the dlcs improve the game by so much and the depth to this game is so great this game is a must have
recommended
i dont play this game oftenbut when i do i play 10 or more hours straight
recommended
civilization v is a pinnacle for all strategy games out there great improvments in many areas compared to its older cousins the game itself is very addictive and like the previous versions you tend to lose a lot of time out of your day to this game without realizing it this just proves how mesmerizingly fun this game can be at first i thought this game would be difficult to grasp because of the idea of religion being abolished altogether however it was the exact opposite if you have played the previous civilization games this one will be pretty easy to grasp and pick up on for new gamers being introduced to strategy games there is a very nice tutorial within the game itself that explains everything you need to know and to understand it easily its a great game to start with if your new to civilization andor strategy games in general this is one of the best of best out there there could be no better time to start civilization than right now
recommended
its pretty fun with a lot of options for replayability its great with friends too
recommended
faith is an option
recommended
this is the best civ game i have ever played
recommended
i was just strolling around during the industrial era as the germans and i see some indian troops i befriend them not knowing what horror i unleashed upon my 3 city empire he comes two turns later and offers me open borders and i accept assuming he is really chill dude i send out two of my heavily promoted riflemen that defend my main cities when all of a sudden ghandi sends his troops straight at all of cities except berlin i thought that he just sent them to protect me assuming that he may have believe to be an attack from the japanese that i was at war with even though the fighting stopped for a while next turn i get a declaration of war from ghandi feeling very betrayed i sent my cannons towards his modern infantry with all of my might after this i see a horrible sight from all of his cities about 5 or 6 he sent nukes at all of my cities and right infront of my riflemen cutting them off from saving us from what happened next seven modern infantry come rolling in at my final doorstep in an attempt to stop them i spend my whole treasurey on troops to defend only to be attacked head on by ghandi my whole lifes work down the drain never trust ghandi by the way great game
recommended
great game totally worth the buy
recommended
this game is a very fun turn based game that it is more entertaining when playing with friends i reccomend buying the game when it is on sale because it can go as low as $1250 and this game has great graphics and wonderful gameplay waiting to be played by you and your countless other friends
recommended
great addition to the civilization series i would totally recommend this game it is enjoayble and although falls short compared to the previous offering in level of detail and polish the new gameplay will definitely capture your attention for many hours
recommended
there is no need for a serious review of this game just gandhi and more gandhi and more gandhi and some nuclear fallout  911 would watch again
recommended
the best grandstrategy game of all time
recommended
if you buy this game you will be addicted to it forever
recommended
best civ game so far mods are great definantly recommend this game
recommended
as someone that is still learning the game i found that the asyouplay tutorials are not the most helpful and dont really help in shallowing the learning curve however from what i have played there is a lot to control the game is deatail deep and offers a challenge when you need it
recommended
all right
recommended
i only had this game for 2 days
recommended
best game ive played
recommended
can i has being civilized
recommended
oh gosh dangit i made the mistake of installing this game and sunk 12 hours into it over two successive days playing a quick game in two sessions best mistake ever ive been a fan of the civ series ever since i discovered civ ii and have played every version since except for civ rev the facebook game and civ iand that includes the test of time games and both versions of colonization and this is another worthy entry in the family im a big fan of how it gives you the tools to analyze your strategies and change them on the fly
recommended
my first match start > finish off neighbor civs 3 > took lands > took 2 city states allied to them > allied with remaining city states with gold > tricked remaining civs into war > gifted tons of units to city states close to civs > went at war with them > terrorize with atomic bombs > what is this world leader thing me 46 delegates them 6 each > you have triumphed over your foes through the art of diplomacy your cunning and wisdom have earned you great friends and have divided and sown confusion amoung your enemies forever will your be remembered as the leader who brought peace to a weary world  diplomatic victory
recommended
civ v is a superb game if you bought all the dlc if not it is not really worth the money but with both major dlc it really shines especially in multiplayer
recommended
this game will ruin your life i fully recommend it
recommended
my absolute favorite game it is amazing
recommended
the notorious just one more turn games nuff said
recommended
very addicting game almost to the point where it is unhealthy so many ways you can go about this game from the scenarios mods dlcs total domination seems like i will be getting hundreds of hours of gameplay out of it and that isnt even including dlcs 30 bucks is a little steep for this game and the expansions dont seem to get any cheaper which by the looks of it gods and kings seems to be the best one that game of thrones mod tho if you stumble upon this game on sale it is a must buy 1010
recommended
i wasnt a fan of civilization series but this is the only game i enjoyed and even managed to learn how to play and do not trust gandhi
recommended
hours of fun gauranteed
recommended
great game with solid rules and structure
recommended
1010 love the game it is good
recommended
if you like turnbased games with a gridlike map then this is the game for you you get to choose a civilzation which has its perks and then build it from the ground up by creating cities researching tech making units etc it has an exelent style of gameplay ranging from unit health to resources around a city and cililzation happiness one thing i miss are goverments from early civilizations but overall its an exellent game
recommended
11hours 1st day nothing more
recommended
really fun game in my opinion its better with brave new world but even the base game but for 30 extra dollars its tottaly worth your money
recommended
this game is damn good 1010
recommended
out of all my steam games this is the one game i keep coming back to when it was first released i truly hated it it was a rushed and broken game now it has become one of my alltime favourite games the turn based nature of this game means you get the time to plan your empire and diplomatic strategy battles can become large chesslike conflicts that require you to look at the bigger picture  simple numbers will not win you a fight unless on the easiest difficulty of course the game is engaging with a gigantic tech tree to keep you interested there are also numerous scenarios to choose from such as the fall of rome and the american civil war you can also fully customise your game and create your own scenarios for you and your friends to play the vanilla game is massive and will keep you occupied for many an hour trying to crush bribe sleaze or geek your way to victory then there is the added bonus of the workshop turning this already huge game into an endless life sucking monster from which there is no return in all i love this game and if you like turn based strategy games this is definitely one you need in your collection
recommended
just one more tuuuuuuuuurn
recommended
ooh are you thinking about buying this game i love it and the reason i love it because i can play it im not one for impossible games that you have to do again and again and again and you still die before the checkpoint  you can set the difficulty on this and the difficulties seem to be pretty wide ranging very accessible to newer players but with progression for those people out there who are just amazing at whatever game they touch about playing it though  you have to have the time to devote to it those with families or busy social lives will probably start resenting their families or friends because they want to be playing and those without will never have a reason to stop you just set yourself targets of once ive got to there ill stop but by that time youre working on something else just one more turn and thats just the first game  theres so many variations because theres so much choice of progression throughout the game and then theres all those trophies i do love a good trophy collection that even when you finish the first game youre already plotting which leader and which strategy youll be next i really enjoy the expansion brave new world  im glad they brought religion back culture victories are much more interesting and trade routes are a good way to boost income and partially equalise the science of nations and if half the words im saying make no sense  dont worry a lot of the game can be automated the advisors dont steer you too far wrong and if youve put it on easy enough youre army will overpower the others soon enough to give you a satisfying first albeit violent victory
recommended
if you buy it get at least one of the expansion packs vinalla game is kinda meh
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
its good
recommended
i feel as though now is a good time to write a review of civ v given the relatively recent release of civ byond earth if you are new to the civ franchise buy this game in comparison to civ be this game is so much more polished and generally better but only with all the dlc without the dlc civ be is better once beyond earth gets its own share of overpriced but high quality dlc it will become the goto civ game but right now civ v is the number one title in the series
recommended
this game takes hours to complete a single match once played a 6 player multiplayer with my friends 8 hours later we were not past turn 150 granted some of them were new but we just couldnt move it along any faster i love this game i just wish the multiplayer was somehow more efficient
recommended
its really nice
recommended
i recommend this game for anyone that enjoy slow turn based strategy games if that does not apply to you then this game is not for you
recommended
easily the best entry in the series i have played if for no other reason than unit stacking is no more one unit per tile and a hex based grid system make the game feel more dynamic and tense one of the best strategy games i have ever played and likely the best turnbased i have played well worth the money the expansions are almost necessary however the game works well without either one but with both it unlocks the true potential of the game and truly makes you feel as if you are crafting the history of an empire
recommended
honestly one of my favorite games i have played in a long time my friends and i often play on a team and put the ai on deity the best way to play

sid meiers civilization v is one of the best additions to my steam library ever at the moment im roughly a bit more than 200 hours into the game which is personally a lot of time for me and i still play several turns each week pros  [laptops] does not require a mouse playable on the go i frequently travel by train and whenever it takes a while i grab my laptop and fire up civ  a large variety of civilizations to toy with even more when you purchase dlc and expansion packs with each their unique buildings units and traits  four speed options for the patient and less patient ones me i tried marathon mode big mistake but my ocd kicked in and i just had to finish it  a large amount of mechanics the game is complex but its a great once you get the hang of everything  for those who crave knowledge the game gives accurate information about the civilizations units and buildings  playable on tablets cons  might feel repetitive for some  noobunfriendly imo i wouldnt try playing on normal mode prince or online if youre not familiar to civ or the strategy genre  time consuming be prepared to lose a lot of time playing this game and maybe some sleep once you get hooked  waging war with an ai on lower difficulty levels may be very boring and feel ridiculously easy its common knowledge among players that the ai is terrible naval warfare conclusion civlization v is not a game for those who crave intense action and immediate results civ v is for those who like to put their brain to work and play that chesslike one step ahead way where a grave error can actually screw up your whole game to the strategists out there id highly recommend the game and its certainly worth its price i avoid rating simply because a rating mostly doesnt do anything justice a tip dont buy games or watch films just based on a rating and actually read reviews if you wish to consider something you might bump into lots of cool things that are supposedly considered bad though if i were to actually rate civ id say a 9510 nb i mentioned as one of the pros that civilization is playable on tablets normally this is not possible if you have an android tablet or ipad but there is a way to stream your pc to a tablet using splashtop which is available for both anrdoid and apple products there are several guides available online on how to do this
recommended
in this game you play as a historical person trying to win a science victoryculture victorydomination victory or a diplomatic victory this is an amazing where you begin with warriors and end with giant death robots this is the best game i ever played
recommended
high quality
recommended
if only this translated into my real bank account accrual
recommended
this game is hard strategy turnbased game if you dont patient enough you cant win it but if you are a freakin mind reader or a master of mind i suggest this game would be nice playing with your friends 
recommended
this game is amazing if your the kind of person who likes stratergy and defence basiclly you can choose from a leader of history and change history you can either go single player where you compete againsed computers or multiplayer where you find a server or make your own one the only downside is that there are a few bugs that do not let you go on to next turn or attack enemys when there near your city
recommended
civ v is a great game with lots of adventure and strategy its fun to build your own settlement and to discover new techniques and develop your own civ civ v does take a lot of time though an average game on the quick setting takes 4 hours if you have no patience i dont think civ v is the game for you this game will train your strategy skill and will help you with other strategy games
recommended
fantastic game hours of guaranteed fun
recommended
great game

cool cool 3234

im late to the party yes i know if youve seen my review on the newest game youll know that i hate it forever and ever this game is a beautiful piece of work its easy to understand start with a warrior get science upgrades make new things simple the new game start with a thingie what is that what is this science what is reputation this game is 9726 times better than any other game in the franchise if youre looking for a good civilization game buy this one or civ 3 that  was the bomb 910 great with friends great solo easy to understand and play amazing all around only problem is that if you are playing with your friends or strangers the nations they choose can be way more powerful than the one you choose for example russia and france russia gets 2x resources france gets 2x culture which do you think will do better nitpicking aside great game
recommended
great game love it
recommended
could use more pony mods
recommended
 im addicted
recommended
whenever i fail at anything in life the trombones from the price is right play in my head now i hear the sound of a wonder being built in a far away land instead 1010 would scream profanities at queen elizabeth again
recommended
the best game to play with your friends its like monopoly it ruins friendships
recommended
this is one of the best games this is my most played game in my library not only that i have a sucky computer even then i can fully enjoy the game honestly i dont care what anyone else has said get the game you will love it well if you like turnbased strategy games want me to tell you the best part of the game having a full blown nuclear ww3 at the end of the game seriously get the freaking game
recommended
its so easy to lose hours of time playing this game and its easy to have fun advancing your civ and plotting against other civs amazing game
recommended
hours of fun with friends
recommended
oh my god i spent 249 on this in the summer sale two years ago thinking it would run its course of being fun for a while and then give up on me after a few months yet it didnt i love this game so much it is soooo addictive
recommended
this taught me how to hate everyone
recommended
this is a review of the complete edition experience may be vastly different for standalone i have held off on the review until i finally broke the 100 hour mark due to exploring everything the game has to offeron that note let me tell you a hundred hours is not enough to explore everything the game has a large selection of civilisations to play as and i in these hundred hours have only completed about 6 full matchesi have only played as six of the forty three civilisations and i can tell you from the aztecs to the polish there is something there for youthe game is really easy to get into unlike some strategy games but the game takes time and will no doubt consume you so lets get on with this buy it now but all joking aside if you are remotely interested try the demo it gives you a sample bite that isnt even a percent of the full games experience so if you are new or a veteran of turn based strategy you should give this game a shot as it is definitely worth the priceor you could wait for the sales that pop up every few weeks
recommended
amazing game to play with friends
recommended
the first civ game ive played and probably will stick as one of my favorites though civ v on its own isnt that great id recommend getting g&k and bnw with civilization v
recommended
simply astounding one of the best strategic games ever will keep you hooked until you realize its like 330 am then your like  i better sleep so i can wake up and play more of this amazing game it is also a great way to take a bored day and turn it into a acomplished day full of choosing productions
recommended
i cant believe i havnt reviewed this game its ing great unless you play  with ionic bonds  against ghandi  as ghandi  as a scientific civilization because then you will be referred to as an op scrub by your friends  as japan because then you will be referred to as an op scrub by your friends  without dlc  without good connection  on deity difficulty  as a religious civilization you snooze you lose  with raging barbarians  on a giant map i find it annoying takes too long  on a small map friends find it annoying too clustered  when homework is due  when your mother is calling your full name  when a new episode of arrow is on  you have less than 12 years make no plans  you forgot to save your last game raging is understandable  im tired of making a list  lists are   lists are boring  with covalent bonds

my social life was razed to the ground my girlfriend was destroyed by barbarians its been three years of turns since my last shower an echo keeps ringing in my now demented mind one more turn civ v is love civ v is life

an excellent turn based game its hard to describe the game in full with the dlc and without theres just so much to it without dlc in game theres diplomacy warfare alliances and social policies that will shape the world of your civs and others with the gold edition gods and kings there is improved diplomacy religon and espionage is your religon the only acceptable one are you curious about your enemies motives with brave new world you can vote on pressing matters and it completely reworks the culturally victory from arts funding to policies that limit armies and nuclear weapons these things great enhance the game once the world congress is founded for the cultural victory you now have to spread your culture via tourism once everyone loves your culture you win believe me its quite difficult over all its a great game i really appreciate the work put into it and i hope to spend countless more hours playing it

a spectacular amazinglyfun game perfect for the history buffgamer a wide selection of civilizations to pick from and immersive gameplay that will keep you playing for hours seriously hours im not even joking i recall that there was one match that went on for almost four hours regardless this game is fascinating and involving and even has the history of units buildings wonders and leaders built into it i highly reccomend this game its a musthave just dont start playing it late in the day or at night
recommended
great fun game both online and offline would highly recommend playing with lots of friends as it makes for much more interesting gameplay only situation i have with the game is that it ends at a too early date and could go on a little longer apart from that i would say it is a great game to play very relaxing very fun 910

this game this ing game this is easily one of the best games ever but then again no game where you can play as a worldconquering ghandi is a bad game

sid meiers civilization v is possibly one of the best stratergy games that you will ever come across it topped all civs before it and is even better than beyond earth you could be sat there saying to yourself just a quick game the next thing you know youve spent over 5 hours of your life and jumped over 200 turns this game is a must buy
recommended
i do not know how to describe civ v except for amazing this rts game may be slow moving but its stratagy is beyond compare civ v incorporates history and gaming in a way that makes it one of the greatest games ive played
recommended
one of my favorites when you first start the game you can hardly stop you can choose a famous leader from throughout the time and each have it speciality and you choose how you will conquer the world by by war by politic or science and more its all up to you this game is a must prepare to be consumed for hours d 1010 <3

this game is amazing to the point of rebuilding great empires or civilizations and breaking them down to control the world

civ 5 is one the best stradegy games i have played in a while it will take you many hours to complete a game and there are hundreds of hours of replayablity the multiplayer also works well if you are trying to find a new stradegy game that you can spend a lot of time in look no farther

1st game on civ 5 made settler moved a bit settler got captured by settlers city got attacked lost the game 1010 would recomend
recommended
dear potential purchaser do not buy unless you have a lot of free time and do not have a a job b a relationship c friends in all seriousness this game is quite superb its like settlers of catan but more complex way more complex just a tip take advantage of gandhis lack of nukes preatomic age and just kill him

it is a great game with a better system than any civ game to date settling citys is a bit more difficut but that aside you can make hugre armys easily and crush your enimeys or take the peace and be friendly to everyone make your citizens happy and make trades often once again you should buy this game and play every nation and find the one that fits u great game buy it

if your a fan of strategy games give this game a spin civ 5 offers a ton of fun content available to each player with multiple ways to pave the path to victory the core game itself is a good game add gods and kings or brave new world and your playtime basically doubles and triples even with all my hours in civ i still dont tire of playing it 910 would play again

an amazing game if you are a turnbase fan than this certainly a game to buy i do recommed buying the gold version as the dlcs greatly improve the gameplay 1010
recommended
where do i begin the countless nights ive stayed up playing this game the fact that im thinking about my current game at work and devising a counter attack this game is addicting do not get it if you dont have time to play as a turnbased strategy game it gives you enough time to think about what the best course to take would be and then act on it this doesnt mean its slow or boring though ive sunk a couple hundred hours into it and theres still things im learning about i highly highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone except maybe cod players
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is a turn based strategy based around the world that gets you so addicted to it you can literally scream just one more turn and have ten or twenty more because its that fun however this game does have its drawbacks looking at the game basically there are a few goals that get more and more complicated as you progress throughout the game these goals may include settling citys with a settler as after you have gone through five hundred to one thousand turns there is hardly any land left to settle on because the ai the computer is also taking land another one of these goals is science points how fast you research something in the game if you get lots of these with buildings or social policys earned by settling citys and happiness level you can get better and better at the game for example when you research nuclear fission you get nukes this can cause extreme damages to cities and units around them starting you game aiming for science is not a bad idea but if you dont earn enough gold per turn earned by having buildings or trade routes to other cities you may fall into debt and if you run out of gold it starts taking your science instead of gold because you have no gold left and the final goal that gets harder and harder is your happiness level this is how happy your civilians are within the game this falls when your people are unhappy with certain buildings or if falls if you have taken an enemy country however if your happiness falls below zero your cities wont grow and if it falls below ten armies of revolting civilians appear near you capital ad start burning your stuff this may decrease your science or even gold so keep your citys happy there are many goals of this game that are all very different and special in their own ways science  a science victory is where you have to get your capital to produce parts of a rocket and launch them into space however you have to do this before any of the other players culture  for a culture victory you have to complete five culture trees which are all roughly made up of five social polices to get culture you need to be happy and you need to have built buildings that improve your culture per turn domination  after a while in your game you can choose to declare war on people and once you completely taken another persons cities they exit the game leaving one less player in the game domination victory works by only having you as the last player in the game in my opinion this is the most fun victory as it happens very late on in the game and is the last victory that can be won so there are many things in this game i really like the first thing is its simplicity any new player can hop on this game and get the basics in no time at all and it has things for people that are more experienced for example different tactics you can follow to make late or early game more enjoyable another thing i really like about civilization v is the adventure and freedom to explore for example at the beginning of the game you decide what you want to do not someone else as you have the freedom to build scouts and roam the land or just keep to your city however there are things in this game i really dont like for example the need for dlcs this game is really brought alive with dlcs as they add so much that should have been in the game anyway as well as balancing things that are way to overpowered in the first place like auto heal heals your unit to full health another thing i dont like so much about the game is to achieve a domination victory you basically have to disable all of the other victories as domination happens at the last stage of the game whilst all the others finish before it in this game there is an option to buy dlcs as i slightly spoke about above in what in what i dont like about the game the first dlc you will hear about is called brave new world and i personally love this dlc it adds so much to your game for example it adds religion which helps your economy and allows you to purchase units cheaper however this comes at a price as other people try to convert your cities and get rid of your perks another thing that brave new world adds is new people and technologies this is a major part of the game and it just makes it more fun for example one of the technologys it adds brings xcom squads to your game and they can parachute 40 tiles away from your territory allow for more dynamic wars overall this game is all i ever wanted it literally got me screaming just one more turn and this is why i think this game deserves a 45 rating its not perfect but if the game included brave new world with it instead of having to buy them separately it would be a 55 and a must have to any gamer review by james duncan

awesome game some of the best strategy ive ever seen coupled with diplomacy i recommend it for any strategy player
recommended
hours of fun and fustration waiting for your turn lol great game
recommended
excellent game especially after the 2 expansions lots of great civs and they are really unique best played with friends but single player is just as good if you dont have the game make sure to get the complete edition when it goes on sale for like 7 dollars or so highly recommend
recommended
really when it comes down to it you probably already know this game is awesome and you either a havent tried it or b know its awesome from personal experience give it a go if you havent especially if turnbased stratcitybuilders seem kinda interesting to you tha major difference ive found between civ 5 and its predecessor civ 4 is that civ 5 is really clunky and boring without all the dlc i played standalone civ 4 for countless hours civ 5 simply didnt click with me until i bought the dlc at the urging of a friend moral of the story is buy the game and all the dlc during a sale its worth it
recommended
for a long time i used to hear stuff about this game there is a big joke online about ll play 1 more turn and 10 hours pass or i play until i realise its 7am and i have to go to work and for a long time i thought it was funny but never really understood it until i bought the game its phenomenal and many times when i go to save i realise that i wasnt saving 15 minutes later but 3 hours later my 1st session ended exactly as the jokes i have heard so many times on forums and in steam reviews i do have to note that this is the kind of strategy that is tailored exactly for my tastes so i got hooked immediately i highly recommend this im just having fun and learning the ropes with the base civ v i dont even have the expansions yet and i hear they make the game 10x times better you can always jump in for a world conquest and enjoy hours of fun the amount of playtime you can get out of this is insane just pure value for money this game is a huge bargain <3 1010

if a console gamer asked me to give them a list of the top 5 pc games they needed to play one of the games id tell them to play would be civilization 5 it is absolutely one of the greatest games i have had the joy of playing the game just throws you in without a strict tutorial you might find in most rts games but honestly it doesnt take that much skill or overall knowledge of the games systems to start playing simply plop your settlers unto a hex the recommended placements are great and start playing its a turn based game so you have plenty of time to think through your moves and choices there are so many things to look out for happiness citystates economy trade researching the techtree culture city growth and each of those things may drastically effect gameplay enemy ai is fantastic but sidenote i recommend players with experience in rts to play at least on the prince level otherwise you wont get that much of a challange combat system works great with many details factoring into a buildingunits ability to attack and defend diplomacy improved with brave new world dlc is one thing ive wished was better but then again ive never played it with bnw dlc so perhaps its completely different but all you can really do besides trade is declare warpeace and denounce people the ai will come to you with wierd proposals like hey give me your awesome oil research and ill give you uh how about dat pottery that scenario might not be real but still ive definitely denied my share of strange trades which may lead to worse relations get it if turn based strategy floats your boat then by all means buy it especially when its on sale

civ is civ and will always hold a special place in my heart i played civ 2 the year it came out while in the 8th grade a few years later i got a free copy of civ 1 on a pc gamer cd and played them both for many years i love this game as i am not very good at rts games these days because i can not keep up with all the clicking and multitasking civ 5 is a lot of fun if you like to stratergise as there are always plenty of factors to consider with every move in the later game the average time i spend on a skirmish is about 6 hours so dont plan to have a quick 30 minute game before bed as you will be chanting one more turn as the sun comes up i used to play this game with my house mate when he had trouble sleeping 30 turns in and hes out like a light i hope you all enjoy this game as much as i do
recommended
i definetely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rts games one of my previous rts favorites was age of empires ii & iii and i wondered if it was anything like it the answer is not really this game has more depth into advancement for your empire and it is a turn based game also be warned that this game will suck up hours of your time as it can be very addicting and games do indeed last a long time typically you can however speed things up by changing your settings to create and research things quicker taking less turns to do stuff the game might be a little complicated at first and a bit discouraging when you see so many different stats to keep track for but its not as bad as it looks and it wont take long before you start getting the hang of how everything works also if you are hosting multiplayer be sure to uncheck quick combat in your host settings if you want attack animations enabled for online play i mention this because i thought it was bugged or thought thats just how the game was got me quite frustrated for a bit there before i found out how to enable it i personally would not pay full price for this game however i bought the complete edition when it was on sale for $1649 67% off score 9510
recommended
i recommend buying this game
recommended
was only going to play it for an hour or so but spent hours on ends playing it so good
recommended
sooooooooooooo good yooooo if you dont have this game yet than your missing out 1010 sick brah

thought id choose ghandi as an ally because well you know hes a nice guy was later invaded by this nice guy while i was entirely preoccupied by my conquering of russia 1010 right in the 
recommended
best strategy game ever perfect for multiplayer and extremely real when compared to real wars and world history
recommended
when i first started playing i foolishly thought ill play for a couple of hours little did i know those hours turned into a whole night session playing civ 5 as 4am approaches i realize how addicting this game is you have been warned you cant plan how long you will play the game will release you when it is done with you 
recommended
very good game if you like risk then you will like this game
recommended
a long playing stratergy game in which you can lead your civilization to victory or be crushed by more powerful and vicious leaders along the way learn how best to use your civ and keep your people from revolt this is not a game to knock over in a lunch break but one to languish on over a couple of days great fun to play with some friends
recommended
well what can i say ive got 491 hours put into this game and im still learning things even after all this i can still look at this game and wonder what if i tried this strategy would things happen differently i cant imagine any other game could possibly offer as much content as civilization 5s complete edition the only flaw happens to be with the ai at higher difficulties when you play for the first time they are more than a match for you at the regular difficulty because you simply dont have the knowledge to compete with them however as you play and learn more about the game you begin to understand how to optimize things and quickly learn ways to beat those pesky ai at higher difficulties the only way the game counters your skill is by giving those opposing civilizations bonus resources and units that a normal player would not have at the highest difficulties the sheer amount of advantages given to these civs can make them darn near unbeatable this creates a certain niche in your late game experience where either you manage to get extremely lucky with your civs location and manage to outproduce the other players or you end up getting stomped by an ai that was showered with a ridiculous amount of benefits regardless of this achilles heel ive found that these benefits are just balanced enough at king and immortal difficulties that the game still feels like a competition where you have a fighting chance playing with friends is a blast if your not very good at the game you can team up with a friend who may be a veteran and can carry you or if you want to play this with someone new its easy to set it up on a low difficulty and still be talkative and social in the end this game in my opinion has something for just about everyone
recommended
what can i say i have played this game off an on for years i am married with children and have a job so i do not have quite as much time as some of the marathon civ players look at some of the hours on record  3000 hours of gameplay is the equivatent of 15 years of 40 hour work weeks although i may not play it as much as others it is the replay value that always brings me back most games are done once you finish the campaign or storyline this game is fresh and fun every time years from now when youve put the kids in bed and you have a moment to yourself youll boot up the computer look at your games list and see civ v youll say to yourself i havent played that for a while as soon as you load the game it will be like you never left trust me i know
recommended
addictive game 1010
recommended
great way to forget about everything else for a few days hope you didnt have plans for your weekend because this game is going to eat every second
recommended
havent been playing it for long but for the time i did i couldnt stop playing soooooo addicting
recommended
theres a few features that would really improve the game massively but it still retains addictive and satisfying gameplay as someone who adores history and strategy this is a brilliant game i feel as if it is a true celebration of human history and culture
recommended
im going to be honest as a gamer i will enjoy all aspects of a game depending if its good or not i got the game from my game shop as a heavy recomendation from metacrtic youtube videos and google review searches even the cashier said you will like this overall this game is fun for those who like stratagey 810 however this is not my game because i dont get the game or concept of wtf i should be doing
recommended
great game i can spend hours on one game
recommended
no story doesnt matter you are in control of the earth it doesnt loose its charm the old games still hold up really well but this one is really great works on my cheap windows 8 tablet worth it
recommended
im only on turn one but its an okay game

i clicky and stuff happens sometimes clicky is bad i learn from bad clicky bad clicky leads to good clicky all in all i like to clicky

played as siam spain attacks ally send in the elephants

very good fun with loads of friends even with the cpus it can be hilarious you can nuke them later game or even just build a massive army and obliterate early game quite hard to do i play this with my friend loads and even some games take up to a whole day and we are yet to finish one but not far off i would recommended this game a lot but only if you like these kind of games stratergy civ v rules review by gunns4l0an
recommended
amazing game but dont expect to play a quick game i have spent over 50 hours on this game at the time of writing this review but have only just finished my first civ simply wonderful strategy game
recommended
throw money at this because it is awesome and i have almost got 200 hours play time on it making it my most played game and for good reason too
recommended
one of the best turn based strategy game ever made 
recommended
great game
recommended
definately buy the complete edition though its only a few dollars more and many times better than the vanilla version alone
recommended
i havent played a civ game in years and this one makes it extremely easy to get back into the fold it guides you along step by step to make it fun yet still challenging replayability is obviously very high as the game is different with every playthrough
recommended
this game is very enjoyable and a very fun game it can be historical with the quotes and stuff at times and i was just talking to my teacher about this game how it deals of what were doing and stuff fantastic you can even make the religion of spain soccer i also played as america and ended up in the middle east with alexander the great im dead i also ended up in canada with britain and germany forming a alliance great game challenging ai and even works with a touchscreen omg lets cross our fingers for a mobile sid 5
recommended
this game is great it only took me 100 hours to beat the game the first time then at 110 total hours i beat the game in 76 turns my life is complete
recommended
when you first play this game if you have alot of players can last hours this is not a bad thoguh becuase those hours will be full of fun if you like manageing citys buildings and an army this game has replay ability but can get boring in multiplayer becuase you can be deep into a game and people will leave and it just turns into and ai match
recommended
not sure if should buy coc or cs go keys
recommended
just buy the ing game you will not regret it
recommended
loved this game highly recomended
recommended
i just finished my first game after playing another turn great game
recommended
is good do play
recommended
as a long time strategy game fan i can happily say this is my game of choice in this generations games this is the game that sucks up most of my play time right after kerbal space program and i can easily reccommend it to anyone trying to decide to buy it especially right now while its on sale 1010 easy
recommended
good game wish i had the dlc
recommended
if you want a lax turn based strat game with some character with a touch of empire management look no further building on previous titles in the series civ5 comes out shining brightly it has a lovely range of nations to choose from in the base game with plenty of addons putting more in furthermore the steam workshop is partnered with the game allowing for creative mods to be made to enhance or change the game completely the game engine itself can be run in both dx9 and dx10 so for those with slower systems its easier to scale down the requirements on top of that if you have a high end tablet i5 cpuwindows 8 expect to enjoy the integrated touch screen capabilities inbedded in the game however if i had a gripe to give it would be how the ai doesnt scale well when it comes to difficulty and turn progression playing on the harder difficulties gives the ai massive early game boosts which can feel unfair at times but once the game session is half way through player progression usually grows exponetially i believe that this is a hard limitation to address and as such much couldnt be done on the other hand ive seen mods that have tweaked ai settings to balance this issue out something to check out ultimately i believe this is a great addition to the civilization franchise and you wont be disappointed
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is a superb game for the strategic gaming community of steam involving multiple simmulations of the development of a human civilization through the passage of time with a multitude of victorys and ways to achieve them from influential leaders of humanities past to play as from leaders such as catherine the russians to napoleon the french you embark on a conquest to subdue humanity through the means of a cultural economical technological or domination victory
recommended
with the brave new world expansion it is near perfect
recommended
1010 would get nuked by ghandi again
recommended
uh you get to rule a nation acting as the driving force to world domination choose your settlement develop some resources and  it i was like one turn away from building that wonder you prick
recommended
epic must play for strategy lovers
recommended
one of my favorite games this game is a strategy game and it is one of my favorite games of all time the game is based on a travel through time and you are against or with other states or countrys you take controle of a famouse leader and with that leader you have to either deffeat all the other states on the map or be the first person to advance to the future along the way you have to advance in technolegy and you can chose what your focus is going to be from the get go maybe your people will focus on moeny maybe on warfare or even religion the gameplay is very simple move your pices every single round or give them a comand such as attack or build along the way you have to make sure that your people are happy you have resources your tecnoligy is going well your citys are growing and much more this can sound complicated but after some time you get used to some of the controles and the game becomes much easier the game is fun when you play singleplayer and multiplayer but be avare that a game will take a long time this is not your typical lan party game that a normal game can take up to 10 hours the game is fantastic and a thumps up is all i can give it but trust me this thump is as high as it can get 10 out of 10
recommended
is a great startegi game
recommended
this is really good game where you need to control your civilization like the name tells theres many countrys you can achieve 287 achiements if you have all the dlcs you start on stone age and end on future
recommended
tbh ive only played about 59 hours on this game however this game is insanly addiction if you are looking to buy this game you should wait till oct cause they will release the newest game  beyond earth and of course theyre gonna make a sale for this game
recommended
old new doesnt matter so many countries more you understand this game more fun you will have
recommended
this game is real gud
recommended
i have not played much i know but dont think that that is a reason not to trust me as i have played many more hours offline now to the review pros lots of civilizations to play as 15 in depth 5 multiplayer 15 each nation has its own unitsmostly that is 1 put together good 1 good graphics 1 different difficulty levels 5 pretty easy to learn 5 amazing techtree 15 takes a while to finish game 5 essentialy unlimeted replayability 1 cons dumbed down from previous versions 1 not in as much detail as previous versions 5 civilization 5 is an awesome strategy game it has many more pros than cons and rates a 9510 the only problem i have experienced from this game is that it is dumbed down fromn the previous versions i would reccomend this game to begginers to the civilization series but many advanced players will love it as well thank you for reading game civilization 5 rating out of 10 95
recommended
this game is awesome thats all i got to say
recommended
marvellous strategy gamehighly addictive and a great way to pass lots of time ps i highly recommend everyone to get the dlcit has a ton of extra features and is worth every penny

i swore it wouldnt happen i had so much more happy memories of civ iv i had played hours of it and when civ v first came out i laughed in their faces hah i said they whine about that  game when civ iv was right there all along and then gods and kings came out spies religion factions i had to i bought the game for about 30 euro and gave it around 70 hours then a brave new world came out and of course i had to buy that and somehow civilization grew on me with the help of a friend who is much better then i am i was able to stop playing in prince difficulty somehow from there the hours slipped away from me at one point i found myself awake at 2am with a head cold planning to expand my empire on a map i had already dominated i had won yet i needed all my people to have public schools and stealth bombers this game does a very good job of conveying how countries rise and fall kind of it was a surprisingly new idea for me that a country can start in such a  situation and somehow rise out of the ashes thanks to the fall of other countries now if youve read this far down down you will have been disappointed to see no maymay about gandhi and nukes or something bizarre that happened out of context so here goes gandhi researched nukes but was too far behind so i won a space victory 1110 would stick my finger in a hot apple pie again
recommended
it is amazing
recommended
this game is fantastic ive played civilization revolution on 360 and this is 10 times better than that well worth the price
recommended
civilization v a classic real time strategy game this game was a game that i had to try out due to my previous exposure to the xbox version of civilization revolution at first when i had played this game i had disliked it due to major differences between civ v and civ rev some examples could be citystates and a larger tech tree however as i kept trying to understand this game i found myself owning other civilizations such as russia key items that i loved about this game was how they had much more civilizations such as the inca or koreans it really made me happy knowning that i could play as these nations due to those nations not being available for civ rev another item that i had liked in this game would be small items such as the nation having its actual language being played it made me happy hearing real english from george washington rather than hearing random sounds which had happen in civ rev as time progressed i have found myself to enjoy the game if i had to sell this game to someone who has never been exposed to the civilization series i would give them the advice of actually putting a time investment in the game
recommended
some features surpass civ4 but the combat system is still something i sorely miss however with the brave new world dlc the game became more interesting for me trade routes and defending them game my game new life i still wish paradox would get a budget like this for their games
recommended
a very fun game i highly recommend it when i first started the game i was like this is pretty cool but by the end when i was building giant armies sending out spies and mass building robots of death i was just blown away i also got the complete edition for fifteen dollars on 2k publishers weekend which is easily worth it even if you buy it at full price i would still recommend it the only con is it takes a little bit for the game to load up anyway i recommend trying it
recommended
in my opinion this could be one of the best games ever it is quite adictive has detailed graphics and has great multiplayer i have to also say that the celtic empire speaks welsh i love that being welsh myself i would highly recomend buying this game
recommended
really good game you should buy it
recommended
loved this game i never played the civ series before and i just bought this game because i heard the reviews were great when it came out and boy did i have fun i would definitely recommend this game if you like strategy games in general i was an rts fan before buying this ah yes ill never forget the time i nuked japan lol several times because i was a bored rich persian emperor or the time that i conquered the entire world as augustus caesar in the modern era or that time i completed my first science victory fun stuff i say
recommended
what do you mean its already tomorrow
recommended
wow so fun and great buy now
recommended
ill just play for half an hour 10 hours later just one more turn
recommended
i love this game so much i well recommend it to everyone it is awesome
recommended
it is a very good pick if your into strategic games you can wage war or peace with other nations and peoples and eventually rule the world wether it being by scientific dicovories or just being the best civilization there is will you rule the world

its ok

i must say this game is awesomehad played civ iv but this is way better its very complex you can control a nation from stone age til present you can choose what kind of style you like to play war or diplomacyin many cases you will be forced to go war on other nations also there are citystates by helping them either destroy another citystate or build a wonder you will have benfit with troops or other useful things the gameplay is smooth the graphics are fine so its worth of time playingalso to mention if you in a hurry or simply dont have time dont play this game because its too freaking long you can choose from many difficulty if you are new player and dont know anything about it the game will guide you and explain every mechanic or should i say what is useful for the type of game you want to play overall this game is very fun i highly recommend it
recommended
i like this game and it is fun cause i like it and it is fun
recommended
i think its a great strategy game i played this for hours i highly recommand buying this if you like strategy
recommended
dis is a greet game to play with friends if i had any oh thats thats really sad it has great entertainment for many hours of fun great replayability when you have no mates
recommended
with almost 130 hours on record and i havent experienced a crashbug and if i have its been minor i cant believe thats impressive to me but considering the amount of games rushed out the past few years filled with bugs and crashes this game is a godsend with that said its a good game tons of civ to choose from although youre limited to one leader now spying is stronger but simpler theres tons of options to mess with things seemed to have been balanced well victory conditions are also pretty cool i usually do conquest but if i get bored with that i can move onto other things
recommended
if your the type of gamer thats into slowpace turn based strategy games then i would recommend giving this game a try its full of suprises and fun packed battles that will keep you coming back for more
recommended
this game manages to make running a nation really fun by making it really streamlined and well organized you can be the powercrazed warmonger who rushes nukes in the technology tree or the peaceful type who just wants to get the highest amount of gold without getting in anyone elses way
recommended
this is the type of game that you will start playing one afternoon and dont notice how long youve been playing until the sun rises the next morning
recommended
one of the best strategy games ever really fun especially with friends get ready to give all your free time to this game because its really addicting
recommended
love this game thousands of hours played definitive 4x gamemust have for any pc gamer
recommended
awesome game
recommended
it shouldnt even be a question if you havent already bought civ v than do it now
recommended
this is the best game i have ever played
recommended
dont like strategy games love this one great game even for newbies in the strategy genre really good fun with friends shame the loading screens take a little while but it is all worth it to play a relaxing game of civ with mates
recommended
this game is great i have played over 100 hours and loved every second you can settle trade fight make alliances make enemies get ing owned by barbarians and build nukes 1010 will build more cities again map editor  mods  multiplayer  single player  ai very mean ghandi declared war on me 
recommended
its like risk but about 500% more complicated
recommended
singlehandedly the best game that i have ever bought it is the type of game which you can play in so many different ways whilst continuing to be exciting if you have the money to buy this game then snatch it up its worth every penny
recommended
are you having a giggle now you decide to go on sale after spending  oh you mother
recommended
1010 so far the best civ i have played
recommended
this game ruins friendships
recommended
just buy it next time its on sale you wont regret it well i guess you will regret it when it becomes your second most played game behind tf2 of course
recommended
pretty good game i cant say im a huge fan of it as i was of civ iv but its still a pretty solid game i dont like the huge amount of bugs and graphical issues which caused me and so many others not to be able to play it for months 6 for me if you see it on sale id say go for it
recommended
being a mainly fps or fpsrpg type games fan i thought id try a different genre so i bought the complete edition on the last steam sale to just see what all the fuss is about now i know its the most addictive where did the time go just one more turn game i have ever played highly recommended
recommended
very cool strategy game played it for long time and still playing

i have only played civ v for about 2 hours now having never played a single game of sid meiers let alone really and turned based strat games in general so far i can tell and understand why the hype for this game is so big yes at first it seems like it has a decently big learning curve i was kind of overwhelmed at first with what i was supposed to be doing etc but the nice thing about it is that instead of having to go through a huge tutorial for an explanation it tells you what you should be doing while you are starting off your country i like it a lot
recommended
so this game apparently has nukes planes swords guns wars cities huge maps and bombs  i love it i really recommend the game to all people who like creating building and destroying cities its sort of like a simulator in a sense
recommended
i love this game it was a little challenging when i firt started but after this its so fun
recommended
epic in multiplayer
recommended
too addicting
recommended
what you need to know this is probably one of the best stratagey games created if you have the 2 expansions then the game is well balanced to appeal to many different types of play whether you want to stick to your one little city on an island and go for a diplomatic victory or expand your civilization by the might of your military then this game will appeal to you i highly suggest playing with a group of friends or even just 1 multiplayer against other humans or even teaming up against comps is what makes this game great the only flaw is the amount of money you have to spend getting all the expansions so buy the complete edition when its on sale other than that i know its worth the value i have gotten more hours out of this game than any other
recommended
amazing and fun strategy game only the best can win it all
recommended
i personally enjoyed all civ games but this on stands out idk if people think beyond earth is better but i dont its a slow pased game that offers a fun experiance as one of its many civalazations starting in the ancient ara  you can play ancient amerca for some reasonas you progress you will need to establish trade or build a military while tradingi try to stay friendly but its your choice your civalazation so control it
recommended
this is a very very addicting game if you plan on having a social life do not get this make sure you leave the dog several bags of food before you start because you will forget everything once you start playing also get the expansion packs for the best experience and try out the mods because they are easy to get make sure you use the directx 10&11 version not windows 8 touchscreen version unless you are on a touchscreen device you will spend hours on this game and it is very fun i recommend this game highly
recommended
just the intro alone to brave new world makes it worth it to get this game
recommended
simply awesome 1010
recommended
i never would of thought this game would become one of my favorites of all time
recommended
it may seem like another rehash of the old civilization games of yore but once you start playing this game will get its hooks very very deep into you thanks to its massive amount of improvements streamlined but improved experience and hands down the best civilization yet
recommended
ive sunk two hundred and fifty hours into this game and i can say i couldnt be happyer this is a sold strategy epic well worth the investment 1010 edit as of 25012015 that be 601 hours hun
recommended
puny russia i crush you like little babby i crush you
recommended
its a great game however multiplayer is a mess i play multiplayer anyway thou one of my favorite features is that you can see the person you are talking to in singleplayer sadly multiplayer takes all of that away civ can have its moments most of them in multiplayer but i cant help but feel like i am doing the same thing over and over thats when u pause your current playthrou and continue later dont recommend the single version buy the complete pack for maximum value alot better with bnv and gak
recommended
why does anyone think gahndi is so bad hes done absolutely nothing to me actually hes pretty stupid imho seriously he builds all the cities and tries to go for a domination victory like what the 
recommended
this is one of the best bestif not the best game i have ever played it deserves a huge recommendation it has an absolutely astonishing gui especially for this series and great gameplay who doesnt want to dominate the world or if you dont want to do it that way you can dominate the world just through forming the united nations or becoming a huge cultural empire its all about your choices form a huge empire their territory their culture their religion etc
recommended
great game will cause you to lose track of time easily but its totally worth it be careful of gandhi and napoleon
recommended
sid meier never disappoints amazing gameplay a blast with friends
recommended
a new clothing for the old fashoned civ nice gameplay maybe a little easier respecting to previous chapters tons of fun with friends in mp no evident bugs you must get the version with all dlc its kinda having a different game recommended ps i payed 25 and it definitely worth it
recommended
u must have this game in ur steam account
recommended
this game is probably the best turn based strategy game of all time civ 5 has so many victory options and so much replayability though military domination is the most fun in my opinion there are also many great mods for civ 5 if purchased i definitely reccommend starting on warlord chieftain difficulty to get your bearings
recommended
i started playing to see what it was when i saw what time it was i had suddenly played it for 6 hours straight amazing
recommended
this game is a total riot with friends and when you start learning what youre doing it goes up another notch
recommended
910 multiplayer sucks there should be bans for leavers but if you play singleplayer endless fun
recommended
engagement engrosses students with lush graphics and intense historical story lines gameplay is quick and yet satisfying hooking inexperienced gamers and detailed enough to create infinite teaching moments learning approach there is a deep well of ingame social studies information that easily fits in with world history classes transfer of game knowledge back to class content will rely on the teacher working through the game experience later with the students support it wasnt created with educators in mind so it doesnt include any teacher curriculum however there is a devoted online community extensive support base and multiple difficulty levels
recommended
i know ive sid it before but i really admeier the work put into the game
recommended
where do i begin civ v is the one of the best games i have ever played in my 9 years of gaming i love the strategy aspect and the fact that there are so many things you need to pay attention to in order to win the game other than other games being like ahhaha im just guna shoot and den i win haha this game takes thought intellect and time i highly recommend buying this game
recommended
great game i love creating robo france 9595
recommended
the obsessionunending unstopable all three expansionsso addictedhelp me
recommended
if you want to rule the worldand raise your empire this game is for you
recommended
super fun war game playing with friend is the best way to play this game but is still reccomendable on single player build up cities upon cities of foundation on your civilisation and watch is thrive or be destroyed be superior forces great game only problem is tabbing out is super laggy and also the steam severs are of poor qualty on this game would reccomend creating own server 910
recommended
fun for hours
recommended
having played over 1000 hours on the game since i got it in june 2013 i have decided to write a review this game is great game it is slow paced but fun this game will not be a game that you play for a hours because a game can be over 2 hours long because this game is adicting when you play a game for over 26 hours straight you should know what an adicting game is and this games theme is great and it is a key feature in the game its nice and calm in peace tome but in war it is loud andepic the theme alone will keep you playing this game this game has one flaw its way to fun and going away from it is hard this game is such an improvment over civ 4 and is one that i play with respect and pride if you get this gamegood luck going away from it for times more than a month
recommended
just the best nothing more
recommended
buy the expansion packs civ 5 vanilla is okay but the expansion packs gods & kings brave new world make this game as amazing as it should have been at launch
recommended
awesome game first skirmish was 24 hours of playtime and i enjoyed every minute
recommended
this is a fantastic game i love games with a variety of routes you can take which is exactly what this is you could try to establish trade with other nations or just decimate them and take their land however at least on my computer i find that when loading saved games the game sometimes becomes riddled with graphical glitches for example i will load up a game and within a few turns the map and all outlines in the game start flashing on and off for me this eventually leads to a crash in the game im not sure if thats me my computer or the game its still a great game though
recommended
ok so i have a few hours on this game and i can say this game is one of the best ones out there on steam the gameplay is endless  you can choose from countless of leaders and play on all diferent kinds of maps the comunity is great with hundred upon hundreds of mods and something new every week i mean what game will you find where you can pit the aztecs the dutch and the zulus against eachother the multiplayer is also very fun if you can mangage to get some of your freinds together it is very fun to play with even if beyond earth was recently released this game is worth getting for sure id like to conclude with a quote from thomas jefferson civ 5 is an all around gaming experience also someone rescue me from this guys cave help  thomas jefferson march 29th 2015 1010
recommended
if you like civilizations and the roman numural v then i strongly recomend this game
recommended
i really recommend this game it is just so good but make sure you get the dlc it turns it into a whole nother game grayson my friend doesnt own it and he wont buy it cause hes a dumbass with aids but its okay he doesnt know what hes missing just make sure you get it
recommended
it is one of the most addictive entertaining games i have ever played
recommended
great game 
recommended
12 hours a game gr8 with friends but will get mad if they take forever to end their turn 69
recommended
i came i saw i got nuked by ghandi then a massive war destroyed my save file 1110
recommended
1110 one of the best games ive ever played sid meier again makes a fabulous game smooth gameplay and infinite replay value make it top notch with more than a dozen awesome civs and dlc that is very much worth the purchase its a game i asbolutely love cant wait for civilization beyond earth
recommended
if you get the dlcexpansions this game is almost as good as civ 4
recommended
if i could only play one and only one game for a year this would be it you will lose all your time playing this
recommended
kiss your life goodbye this game is greatif yo have played any civ games before you know how awesome they are civ 5 does not let you down endless amounts of fun playing with your friends online is awesome as well who doesnt wanna take over the world backstab your allies to dominate the world
recommended
once you download this game youll never go back just one more turn
recommended
its all good much better than the new sid meier games
recommended
super fun watch the centuries glide by
recommended
is rly good
recommended
good game to play alone or with people best to play when you have no plans for an entire day itll take up the majority of the day if you take forever deciding on things maybe its best to save lots of time for this it can be fun to play with friends but it is difficult to agree on things as each civilization must expand and conquor the world
recommended
one of the best games ever recommend getting the dlcs totally improves the game
recommended
its like crack but you can quit crack
recommended
cannot recommend enough seriously i tried hitting the recommend button again it didnt work
recommended
yes very buy wow much victory
recommended
one of the best games availible on steam greatest strategy game ive ever played 100% reccomend civilization v for its insanely infinite possiblities
recommended
just one more turn 
recommended
one of the best turn based strategies ever mods make it even better 1010 would civ again i wish beyond earth didnt suck
recommended
1st hour oooooh what does this do 4th hour make a farm make a unit make all dem things 10th hour die everyone die 50th hour ok i got this and this and this and this and that and that and those and those go here and here and here and there and here 141th hour in case you havent noticed i love this game highly recommend getting the complete edition
recommended
i recommend this game why because from my experiances it random on what will happen next within the game  if you start a new game  the only thing that does get boring it knowing what will be coming in the eras units etc its even more fun with friends
recommended
this game is addictive it uses the same tried and true formula of the other games and will keep you glued to the screen for hours as you just need one more turn the game is more balanced than ever if you get the 2 additional dlcs the first makes religion worthwhile and the 2nd adds more lategame options and a revamp of the cultural victory conditions
recommended
went on an expidition with my friend everything went smoothly until barbarians were slowly picking off people one by one only two people survived that day 2010 would feel again
recommended
this game has the potental to be really fun you need to find someone who can spend hours upon hours wasting their lives with you im not one for singleplayer on these types of games but playing on the same team with a friend and trying your hand at world domination  amazing fun atleast credit this game and try it somehow i highly recommend
recommended
fantastic game 1010
recommended
its ok
recommended
i find this as an amazing game however i am a little disappointed by the fact that mods are not supported in multiplayer this game is a bit time consuming but i have spent quite a bit of time and i have been having fun i recommend that you play with friends and have a good game of civ enjoy mein comrades
recommended
easly one of the most time consuming games out there but so fun with friends
recommended
most efficient way to waste time without even realizing it 1010 would waste entire day again
recommended
a very unique game sid meiers civilization v civ v is a 4x video game in the civilization series developed by firaxis games released on microsoft windows in september 2010 when it comes down to it civ v is a turn based strategy game the basic idea of a civilization game is to have the best civilization compared to your neighboring civilizations how you do that can be done in a few ways my first and favorite method is by complete domination of other civs what ill do is grow my civilization expand my borders and declare war on anyone thats a threat to me and my borders or simply to pick on the weak or expand my own territory and civilization as technology within my civilization progresses they go through different eras such the ones listed here ancient era classical era medieval era renaissance era industrial era modern era atomic era information era etc at first my army will just be a bunch of barbarians with axes archers catapaults etc but then as my technology advances eventually ill have modern era soldiers with rifles tanks aircraft and nuclear bombs i just have to be sure not to fall behind on the tech tree or else ill get destoryed by somone with a far more advanced army with guns while i still have axes ultimately ill have to conquer every civilizations original capital city to beat the game although if i dont conquer them fast enough then i may lose to another civ by means of other victory types how well other victory methods may not even regard any combat whatsoever you can have the best civilization with the best culturetourism knowledge of science be the first to launch a spaceship diplomacy or overall score if the time runs out etc i cant speak for these victory types since i always go for the domination path the maps in civ v are generated by random and offer plenty of variety every time and even if thats not enough than the modding community has you covered theyll have you covered with many other things as well such as custom guis unit skins stastitics etc i cant speak for multiplayer i prefer this time consuming game alone but speaking of time consuming civ v could take as long as a whole day or more just to complete one game but dont let that scare you off just save your game and pick up where you left off next time although there is plenty of customization that can be done in terms of settings to make the game speed faster or much longer as well as make the overall difficulty harder or gameplay more interesting if youre new to civilization games then this game is not newb friendly out of my 130 hours ive only won about 4 times out of plenty of games but that goes to show you that even if i lose civ is a fun addicting experience but for all players no matter the skill level i highly reccomend this site for a guidance httpwwwcarlsguidescomstrategycivilization5 also be sure to pick up civ v complete and not just civ v the base game its worth it
recommended
ive owned this game for about 3 weeks in that short time ive concluded that this is one of the best games ive ever played ever its really fun to play single player and even more fun to play with friends the only drawback is the sheer cost of the game and its dlc so if you have the money get it if you dont have the money save up or not your choice
recommended
this is where free time goes to die rip
recommended
warning this game is really addictive you think you can handle one more turn but after 12 hours you realize it wasn`t one turn i am person who really like strategic games and civilization v is the best strategic game so best game ever made 1110
recommended
900 hours the only reason i will stop playing this game is when the next civ comes out p
recommended
vanilla this game is decent but with brave new world and gods and kings this game is brilliant so much fun and so much time to be wasted i recomend this game to any and all
recommended
1310 ruins all friendships
recommended
awsome game you can just play it for hours and not get bored some things are a bit to over powerd but you almost have to play this game edit the dlc are really worth buying i bought them on sale so if i was you i would wait for a good sale or something that could drive the price down
recommended
the best way to waste a weekend
recommended
>think it wont be a great game buy it anyway >love it >play it all day think about it all night >stop doing basic things sleeping eating bathing my civilization is more important >play all day and all night do nothing else >ruined my life 1110 would play all day and all night again i without a doubt do not regret playing this game even though i hated strategy games i was persuaded by friends to buy this and am i glad i did this is one of the best games i have played its one of the top 3 which include bioshock infinite and skyrim each play through can be different depending on who you play with im talking about you alfie the amount of different ways you can play is amazing i cant get enough of it
recommended
this game combines the beautiful playstyle of the other civ games with outstanding dlc and an amazing aray of diversity in a game which at first glance can be repetative no matter how many campaigns or whatever you want to call them this game never gets boring 810
recommended
great game addicted
recommended
if only this translated into my real bank account accrual
recommended
this game is hard strategy turnbased game if you dont patient enough you cant win it but if you are a freakin mind reader or a master of mind i suggest this game would be nice playing with your friends 
recommended
this game is amazing if your the kind of person who likes stratergy and defence basiclly you can choose from a leader of history and change history you can either go single player where you compete againsed computers or multiplayer where you find a server or make your own one the only downside is that there are a few bugs that do not let you go on to next turn or attack enemys when there near your city
recommended
civ v is a great game with lots of adventure and strategy its fun to build your own settlement and to discover new techniques and develop your own civ civ v does take a lot of time though an average game on the quick setting takes 4 hours if you have no patience i dont think civ v is the game for you this game will train your strategy skill and will help you with other strategy games
recommended
fantastic game hours of guaranteed fun
recommended
great game

cool cool 3234

gam is fun wold reccomind this 2 ppeople out ther suggestionz kim jongun dlc  adolph hilter dlc if u c dis show 2 gayben plis this gaem is r8 88 m8 i mastrb8
recommended
fun to play with 2 other people games can last quite a while but they are never dull and there is always deep strategy involved
recommended
civ v is the pinnacle of the civ series  everything before a buildup to this everything after is just a shadow of it its an incredibly addictive and fun game and even if at later stages of the game most of your play time is reduced to just waiting time still flies i would absolutely recommend this game that said there are several minor gripes i have with it  turns late in the game last up to 30 minutes of waiting for ai to finish good for catching up with reading or doing some work on another monitor if you have such an opportunity but not for much else  sometimes internet games get randomly disconnected  when internet games get randomly disconnected the ai immediately takes over for the disconnected player and spends all his remaining moves if the host then saves reloads and reinvites the disconnected people back into the game their turns have been wasted  reinviting disconnected people most often doesnt work if game is already in progress the host will usually have to reload the game  no support of inviting steam players over lan  ai is given cheats on higher difficulty rather than a better strategy as such penalties for unhappiness or lack of gold do not apply to them and their units never get disbanded if they run out of cash thats just no fun and then theres my wishful thinking  itd be nice if the ai and a players interaction with it was in any way customizable  replaceable i would love to write a new ai brain and plug it into the game id add make it up to me options to the dialog when you catch the ai spying on you id add respect and geographical modifiers to an ais decision to attack you id add persuasion stats and perks to leaders and dialog trees similar to those in mass effect or deus ex hr leading to the optimal outcome in negotiations and more  itd be nice if there was a way to remove the barbarian ai from the game after a while  in later stages of the game the barbarian ai thinks for up to 5 minutes even though it has no camps or units remaining or even empty tiles on which to spawn  id love to be able to select which tiles to focus expansion on in the city view  previous civs supported this i think anyway definitely get this it leaves a lot to be desired but it offers so much youll forget about the downsides
recommended
amazing game really pulls you in once you get the basics a lot of variation and endless fun with your friends definitely a must have
recommended
i used to think this would be to hard for me to play but when i started its was easy and fun i recommend this game
recommended
11hours 1st day nothing more
recommended
really fun game in my opinion its better with brave new world but even the base game but for 30 extra dollars its tottaly worth your money
recommended
this game is damn good 1010
recommended
out of all my steam games this is the one game i keep coming back to when it was first released i truly hated it it was a rushed and broken game now it has become one of my alltime favourite games the turn based nature of this game means you get the time to plan your empire and diplomatic strategy battles can become large chesslike conflicts that require you to look at the bigger picture  simple numbers will not win you a fight unless on the easiest difficulty of course the game is engaging with a gigantic tech tree to keep you interested there are also numerous scenarios to choose from such as the fall of rome and the american civil war you can also fully customise your game and create your own scenarios for you and your friends to play the vanilla game is massive and will keep you occupied for many an hour trying to crush bribe sleaze or geek your way to victory then there is the added bonus of the workshop turning this already huge game into an endless life sucking monster from which there is no return in all i love this game and if you like turn based strategy games this is definitely one you need in your collection
recommended
just one more tuuuuuuuuurn
recommended
ooh are you thinking about buying this game i love it and the reason i love it because i can play it im not one for impossible games that you have to do again and again and again and you still die before the checkpoint  you can set the difficulty on this and the difficulties seem to be pretty wide ranging very accessible to newer players but with progression for those people out there who are just amazing at whatever game they touch about playing it though  you have to have the time to devote to it those with families or busy social lives will probably start resenting their families or friends because they want to be playing and those without will never have a reason to stop you just set yourself targets of once ive got to there ill stop but by that time youre working on something else just one more turn and thats just the first game  theres so many variations because theres so much choice of progression throughout the game and then theres all those trophies i do love a good trophy collection that even when you finish the first game youre already plotting which leader and which strategy youll be next i really enjoy the expansion brave new world  im glad they brought religion back culture victories are much more interesting and trade routes are a good way to boost income and partially equalise the science of nations and if half the words im saying make no sense  dont worry a lot of the game can be automated the advisors dont steer you too far wrong and if youve put it on easy enough youre army will overpower the others soon enough to give you a satisfying first albeit violent victory
recommended
my personal favorite of the entire civ series civ 5 civ 4 civ 2
recommended
chose random leader for my first game of civ 5 rolled gandhi set out to build a nice little empire everyone was happy and well fed cotton and whales were plentiful and wonders were constructed to inspire my people then montezuma showed up he wanted my land my people my wonders so i crushed him his empire burned beneath the feet of my armies and his capital crumbled by their hands but it would not stop there my bloodlust would not be satisfied until every nation on the planet met their brutal demise and meet it they did one by one until the green of india spanned the globe it remains the most true to form i have every played a civ leader 1010 would be  gandhi again
recommended
makes time disappear unsure where time ends up sorry for nuking your capital attila
recommended
best game i have ever played all the extra packets and dlcs make the game even more fantastic 1010
recommended
amazing game you can be whatever type of leader you want from a coldblooded  to a benevolent friendly president however dont trust gandhi hell get you if you give him the chance you can make friends with other nations and share riches and borders with or you can make enemies like gandhi that want to nuke you while promoting peace and love there are 5 victory types you got diplomatic victory where someone in the game creates the un and the nations vote for who should be the true world leader you got cultural victory where you win based on how many cultural points you have how many wonders you have built and how much people like your country in order to win you need to research the utopia project you got science victory where you beat everyone in a race to space just create a spaceship and before anyone else does you got time victory a more passive mode where the rules are let the best leader win whoever has the most points by the end of the game wins and finally you got domination victory where you get completely destroyed by such a pacifist leader like gandhi stay away from gandhi and bandits gandhi and bandits
recommended
as it turns out im really good at getting achievments that nobody else has in this game and all you have to do is be a  i dont know what that says about me as a person but i had fun getting it
recommended
great game

ximicacan ximicacan ximicacan the last words you hear before you die or if you bought the dlcs  a gei kho ossos vimba ngisho nawe bala aiveeveh 1010 would get scared of dead civilazations again
recommended
great game spent lots of time playing it
recommended
only recommend if you get both expansions with it the ai may be schizo and cheat a lot and the game may not have the depth of a grand strategy title but its still a fun time sink theres a lot of fun to be had with the civvictory type combos there are also a lot of great custom maps and mods for this game though using mods prevents you from getting achievements if thats your thing
recommended
a must own strategy game
recommended
so you just downloaded this game last night got up bright and early ready to play your new game hooray you started at 900 am a moment later it was 735 pm ghandi just got nukes elizabeth just declared war on you for the 15th time darius just built the ss booster just one more turn
recommended
i just finished my first game after playing another turn great game
recommended
is good do play
recommended
as a long time strategy game fan i can happily say this is my game of choice in this generations games this is the game that sucks up most of my play time right after kerbal space program and i can easily reccommend it to anyone trying to decide to buy it especially right now while its on sale 1010 easy
recommended
good game wish i had the dlc
recommended
if you want a lax turn based strat game with some character with a touch of empire management look no further building on previous titles in the series civ5 comes out shining brightly it has a lovely range of nations to choose from in the base game with plenty of addons putting more in furthermore the steam workshop is partnered with the game allowing for creative mods to be made to enhance or change the game completely the game engine itself can be run in both dx9 and dx10 so for those with slower systems its easier to scale down the requirements on top of that if you have a high end tablet i5 cpuwindows 8 expect to enjoy the integrated touch screen capabilities inbedded in the game however if i had a gripe to give it would be how the ai doesnt scale well when it comes to difficulty and turn progression playing on the harder difficulties gives the ai massive early game boosts which can feel unfair at times but once the game session is half way through player progression usually grows exponetially i believe that this is a hard limitation to address and as such much couldnt be done on the other hand ive seen mods that have tweaked ai settings to balance this issue out something to check out ultimately i believe this is a great addition to the civilization franchise and you wont be disappointed

sid meiers civilization v is a superb game for the strategic gaming community of steam involving multiple simmulations of the development of a human civilization through the passage of time with a multitude of victorys and ways to achieve them from influential leaders of humanities past to play as from leaders such as catherine the russians to napoleon the french you embark on a conquest to subdue humanity through the means of a cultural economical technological or domination victory
recommended
with the brave new world expansion it is near perfect
recommended
i haveny played this game for a long time but i still think it is very fun and addicting a lot of things can happen ingame which makes it all the more harder and more of a simulation game
recommended
its midnight dont plan on sleeping hours pass a phone call who could it be its washington he needs help the french are at it again  gets real i march my arms but theres a knock on the backdoor ghengis khan is here and hes  15 turns later i lose my capital and my cities burn 1010 will get my kids addicted

i really enjoyed civilization v and always find it to be a good game there are amny things i love about this gme for example i can rewrite history in whatever way you like also the many diffrent victory scenarios which make your games endlessly fun overall i rate this game a good 810 as the multiplayer is a bit wierd for me personally becasue it jumps between your units but apart from that good gam pros pretty game looks very attractive endless hours of fun cool multiplayer mode easy to grasp concept of the game cons not as much micromanagement as i would likthe details make a big difference multipalyer a bit wierd for me not sure about you
recommended
attacked france they did not surrender 1010 would get owned by france again
recommended
this is my meth

never played any of the previous civilization games but everyone kept telling me to give civilization v a try so i did at first i found it kind of confusing a lot of things to keep an eye on but after a couple of hours of play id figure it all out and i was hooked great game has provided me with many hours of great fun just one more turn

game of my life
recommended
awesome gameplay features truly a game for the strategic mind a easy game to play yet difficult to master the wide array of features and multiplayer possibilities can make one wish they could play all day all day or for an hour every once in a while the singleplayer mode can be just as challenging and equally as entertaining a 10 out 10 game
recommended
my 2`dn favorite game beaten by civ4 only thing i dislike abouth it is the limitasion of 1 unit pr tile easy to avoid with mods but then ofc you miss out on achivments all in all  a greate tbs
recommended
amazing game and great to play with your friends
recommended
once you start its hard to stop
recommended
all and all a good game for anyone with time to play it of course it has a save option but it is time consuming regardless
recommended
i opened this game and played it for 20 mins before i was going to go out with friends and then after i closed it i checked the time and its been 42 hours 1010 would play again
recommended
great
recommended
i would recomend this game but only for those who have friends it is quite long and boring if you have no one to play with but thats just me

took over rome and called gandhi a  all in one turn 1010
recommended
one of my favourite games to play there is hardly anything as fun as being able to command your own country and become whatever type of ruler you want there are hardly any problems with the game and any that are there are so discrete they are not even worth mentioning there are so many variations in game styles that it becomes impossible to get bored of this game i recomend however getting as much of the dlc as possible as it improves the game play ten fold although if you do not get the dlc you will still get hours of enjoyment out of this i would put this game up there with my top 5 and would definatly give this game 9510 awesome game keep up the hard work cant wait for the next one to come out
recommended
great game 1010

i have not played much i know but dont think that that is a reason not to trust me as i have played many more hours offline now to the review pros lots of civilizations to play as 15 in depth 5 multiplayer 15 each nation has its own unitsmostly that is 1 put together good 1 good graphics 1 different difficulty levels 5 pretty easy to learn 5 amazing techtree 15 takes a while to finish game 5 essentialy unlimeted replayability 1 cons dumbed down from previous versions 1 not in as much detail as previous versions 5 civilization 5 is an awesome strategy game it has many more pros than cons and rates a 9510 the only problem i have experienced from this game is that it is dumbed down fromn the previous versions i would reccomend this game to begginers to the civilization series but many advanced players will love it as well thank you for reading game civilization 5 rating out of 10 95
recommended
this game is awesome thats all i got to say
recommended
marvellous strategy gamehighly addictive and a great way to pass lots of time ps i highly recommend everyone to get the dlcit has a ton of extra features and is worth every penny

i swore it wouldnt happen i had so much more happy memories of civ iv i had played hours of it and when civ v first came out i laughed in their faces hah i said they whine about that  game when civ iv was right there all along and then gods and kings came out spies religion factions i had to i bought the game for about 30 euro and gave it around 70 hours then a brave new world came out and of course i had to buy that and somehow civilization grew on me with the help of a friend who is much better then i am i was able to stop playing in prince difficulty somehow from there the hours slipped away from me at one point i found myself awake at 2am with a head cold planning to expand my empire on a map i had already dominated i had won yet i needed all my people to have public schools and stealth bombers this game does a very good job of conveying how countries rise and fall kind of it was a surprisingly new idea for me that a country can start in such a  situation and somehow rise out of the ashes thanks to the fall of other countries now if youve read this far down down you will have been disappointed to see no maymay about gandhi and nukes or something bizarre that happened out of context so here goes gandhi researched nukes but was too far behind so i won a space victory 1110 would stick my finger in a hot apple pie again
recommended
it is amazing
recommended
this game is fantastic ive played civilization revolution on 360 and this is 10 times better than that well worth the price
recommended
loved this game highly recomended

i was never a big fan of the civilization series but this one has made me rethink my concepts about the accoladed turnbased strategy classic
recommended
if ghandi approaches you and asks for a friendship treaty do not sign it he will backstab you and destroy your hard earned cities and units  you ghandi
recommended
its a fun game

to like a startegy game is one thing but this this takes it to another level of strategy especially when you say to yourself one game or ill just finish my research then your head to head with your biggest rival with greece or something like that and realise i think ive been playing for 6 hours
recommended
its okay i guess 1110
recommended
pretty great my first 4x game and it seems very welcoming to new players i still have only touched the tip of the iceberg of this game so i dont think i have much more valuable insight on it it is very enjoyable and satisfying to throw days away on this game
recommended
this game is awesome civilization 5 recreates milatary and graphics throughout the series the main idea is to create a civilization that will stand the test of time the diplomatic meetings have also been recreated
recommended
this is a pretty good game for single player i dont see much value in playing it competitivly as all multiplayer games take 4 hours to complete even though you can usually tell who the winner is 3060 minutes into the game the multiplayer of this game revolves around where your starting settler spawns start in a terrible area enjoy playing from behind the entire game while the guy that didnt spawn inbetween two hostile ais in the middle of a desert sits back and builds up a 7 city empire while youre living in war stricken poverty even if you manage to overcome the adversities of your starting spawn youre still going to be anywhere from 1540 turns behind which is unrecoverable unless youre playing against an idiot or a n00b buy the game play the single player

stand in line as we march to the drums of the east paralyzed and possessed by crusaders deceased lost in the silence the call from the turbulent times bound by the science that lives on the lips of the wise the beating of a million drums the fire of a million guns the mother of a million sons civilization lost in the silence they bow to the call of the east tantalized and seduced by the demons released ears to the ground by the name of the merciless guide sky onto the fire that burns in the all seeing eye the beating of a million drums the fire of a million guns the mother of a million sons civilization the beating of a million drums the fire of a million guns the mother of a million sons civilization
recommended
spent 50 hours playing this game in hotseat nearly killed my best friend i give it 1010 also steam didnt record time properly so yea  since i was offline
recommended
i recomend this game if you own atleast one of the expansion if not its a pretty good one but you get more conetent with the expansions if you like world map strategy games its the series for you this game has deep gameplay and mechanics and oh so good multiplayer if you are a strategy fan or civ fan your probably going to like it
recommended
this is very good game that gets boing after like 300400 hours of play time biggest drawbacks are  ai of units  ai can build win with you by science but if you have like half a brain you will never lose by militarty conquest it is most apparent in ai moves accross ocean  even having submarine dont help them because they dont use them ai had my battleship on plate with two submarines in range and it just moved it without shotting at my ship it was like most wtf moment in game and i understood that unit moving was done by some half wit and not a programmer other that that game is well balanced i think it can be very entartaining form multiplayer purposes
recommended
amazing everything graphics gameplay you name it and it has it win a peace science culture or even a war victory this is the game for you if you love these command and strategy games but the game does require an exceeding amount of patience as one game can last hours and still end up in loss but it is absolutely one of the funnest things you can do on your devise and i would highley recommend getting it
recommended
a wonderful game since the first release civ 4 was great civ 5 is great too but it comes with better graphic and the hex grid with a different combat system i really enjoy this kind of game  lets do another turn  oh another turn  wait one more turn to me its a real keeper once started u cant stop lol it offers so many depth in politics economy trading research etc which is welcome by old players but it might be hard for new comers
recommended
its allright yeah
recommended
asked alexandra for some wool the whole world declared war on me lesson learned dont ask for wool

just one more turn ah  it you dont really need sleep do you
recommended
do not play this game it will devour your life it will pull you away from other games it will pull you away from your family and friends it will tear your soul apart 1010
recommended
not sure how i feel about gandhi nuking me
recommended
honestly one of the best games ive ever played worth every penny
recommended
this is my favorite game i have ever played because it never gets old you can just switch it up by choosing a different leader or victory type
recommended
absolutely the most addictive time consuming game ive ever played i dont even know why
recommended
this game is absolutely a 1010 100100 best game
recommended
this game is by far the best strategy game ive ever played making you think about complicated strategy and civilizations before you start especially on emperor or higher i usually go for growth and science wich is good for any victory if youre thinking of buying it i advise you to buy brave new world aswell since it makes the game so much better and when youve started theres no not clicking next turn
recommended
matt ing buy it already
recommended
no story doesnt matter you are in control of the earth it doesnt loose its charm the old games still hold up really well but this one is really great works on my cheap windows 8 tablet worth it
recommended
this is one of the best bestif not the best game i have ever played it deserves a huge recommendation it has an absolutely astonishing gui especially for this series and great gameplay who doesnt want to dominate the world or if you dont want to do it that way you can dominate the world just through forming the united nations or becoming a huge cultural empire its all about your choices form a huge empire their territory their culture their religion etc
recommended
great game will cause you to lose track of time easily but its totally worth it be careful of gandhi and napoleon
recommended
sid meier never disappoints amazing gameplay a blast with friends
recommended
a new clothing for the old fashoned civ nice gameplay maybe a little easier respecting to previous chapters tons of fun with friends in mp no evident bugs you must get the version with all dlc its kinda having a different game recommended ps i payed 25 and it definitely worth it
recommended
bought this for 749 from summer sale 2014 for that price the games has definitely paid off its value its entertaining hard and it takes some time to learn id say theres definitely more replay value in this game than in most of the total war series games for example  go from ancient era to future when total war games usually focus on 1 period of time  great game with or without friends but id say you get the most out of it with friends for me this is the best strategy game ive ever played
recommended
if i could have babies with a game this would be the one to have them with
recommended
1010 would invade the rest of the world again
recommended
money money money i just cant get enough
recommended
great turnbased strategy game although its boring without the the expansions gods and kings & brave new world the workshop offers great scenarios like red ww2 mod and fun mods like the pc gaming master race it also provides you with many gameplay fixes and improvements this game surely has its flaws but i had a lot of fun playing it even though i didnt play any strategygames before and i can recommend this game to anyone willing to spend some money on it
recommended
as a civ this is really easy to play and a nice game for some time  but not a really long time motivation
recommended
it is a great strategy game and i highly recommend it
recommended
fun if you like turn baised games
recommended
i play this game when i want to remember what the settelments of rustalius was like before the great rustalion war and how we destroyed our enemys while we become powerful

did you ever want to be president lead your nation to victory by lowering taxes and make sure that the citizens of your nations are happy then go play democracy 3 but on the other hand if you want a more startegic point of view sid meiers civilization v is an extrodinary game the game puts the player in the position of a leader of an area the size that the player picks before loading the world the game features infinetly replayable singleplayer and multiplayer when the player first starts playing sid meiers civilization v it can be very difficult and hard to understand but with some practice the game can become very addictive and a very fun game to play in my final oppinion sid meiers civilization v is 92 out of 10 stars sid meiers civilization v is not free it is currently priced at $2999 us dollars if you have any free games you would like me to review please contact me via steam and i will play the game and give it a review derrickspy123
recommended
tried to recreate world war 2 with washington bismarck catherine oda nobunaga and elizabeth it didnt work out as the ai civilizations were too passive i had to fool around with the civilization combinations until i got one consisting of ramkhamhaeng montezuma alexander pachacuti and gandhi this combination gave me the desired effect  nukes galore 1110 for unpredictability
recommended
this is an awesome game i played as rome and attacked the dutch with helicopters and invaded the swedish with giant mechs 1010 would squish stockholm with giant robots again also make sure to get the dlc they are awesome note i dont have anything against the dutch or the swedish i am just joking abouting squishing stockholm
recommended
it was gloriousglorious
recommended
repeat history or recreate it as for ghandithere was an original bug where the ai for him would reset his likeness relations with the player throughout the game ghandis fondness for you would scale up & up the more you accepted him however once ghandi had reached his full likeness potential he would reset back to his oringal state around the time of the modern era when nuclear power wasnt far ahead this meant that you were more of a complete stranger with a threatening military in your hands who needed to be eliminated its said that the bug was once fixed but the players pleaded for the ultimate ghandi back soon after  as a result the most peaceful man in the world wants to  your mother and children to create the ultimate racethe ghandi race 9810  would suck ghandi dry for uranium
recommended
put so many hours into this probs my favorite game cant wait for beyond earth
recommended
if you dont have this game youre not a true pc gamer kidding
recommended
gandhi declared war on the us and won 1010
recommended
one of the most time consuming and fun games i have ever played like one match takes about and around 8 hours on easy
recommended
me and civilization go way back and to be honest this installation didnt speak to me at once it is far less advance then the fourth and that can be a disappointment for some old timers like me but if u give it time you will see that the new battlesystem makes this a much more enjoyable combative experience than any in the series a must buy for everyone experience players will awe after some time new players will find this much more enjoyable then the fourth
recommended
first game 200 turns in kicked gandhi out of delhi in south scotland have 20ish cities  next highest is 6 my people are happy followers of blitzkrieg  what time is it

ive been playing civilization games for many years and still have the original boxes too i was very skeptical about moving from civ vi to civ v given the bad reviews out there at the time of purchase after 34 years and all the expansions ive found it to be a great addition the ai still needs improvements and the multiplayer is horrendous but the game itself is super i highly recommend the game and if you were to play it with other humans then id say choose friends and via lan

this game is ing amazing get it

recommended
one of the best games on the market without questioneven if you are new to turn based games civilization 5 is a simple and addictive experience that you will be playing for hours on end 910
recommended
keep your friends close and your enemies even closer
recommended
its about time i talked about civ 5 anyway to start off buy this and you will be addicted to it like pot you shout one or more turns wouldnt hurt what seemed like a few minutes turned into hrs and you finally notice that youre dead but you still continue to play civ 5 just my imagination anyway this game is in fact amazing its a great tbs that will keep you thinking about your tactics throughout the whole game save it will keep you hours on end and can be very unpredictable unless youve played alot like me the unique gameplay is very engaging and thus keeps you playing no matter what is happening sarcasm intended so there are still many things i would like to say but ill try keep this short obviously if you are thinking of buying this you should also buy civs many dlcs in a pack ofc as it will literally glue you to your computer screen sarcasm >< the game allows you to play lots of great leaders infamous and famous and ultimately crush other civilisations got your attention yet there are some things to note such as after you play civ with dlc you wouldnt want to go back to vanilla civ another thing i do want to point out is that for some reason civs achievements is very glitchy and therefore says like 15% completed and says that some i havent done even though i have done things like anex a city state which has been previously puppeted just something you might needed to know ^^ so overall civ 5 had given me many memorable hours of gameplay believe it or not i play on offline mode too and you can also smash your friends or get smashed in competative multiplayer for more fun but seriously this monster of a game should be banned as a drug but not really because i really like this drug xd 1110
recommended
im not addicted i can stop whenever i want
recommended
i massacred thousends of russians it was a ripoff of the third mission of cod modwarf2 but i enjoyed it
recommended
if your willing to stay up hours on end to defend your nation and ignore real worrld responsibility buy this game}
recommended
ive extensively played every game in this series and this newest entry does not disappoint the vanilla game itself is incredible with a limitless number of hours to play as every game is an entirely new experience the number of civilizations that you can choose from with unique units buildings and game changing abilities is astonishing and the level of detail put into the variety of different victory strategies is incredible building your own government by choosing which policies to put into effect and forming and spreading your own religion is extremely entertaining to say the least as well the multiplayer is incredible as well as the game in its entirety is used in multiplayer as well not just parts of it as so many indepth games seem to do this game will never get old for me and i hope the same goes for the rest of you who will be joining me
recommended
best strategy game to play
recommended
has a bit of a learning curve but once you get past that you will never want to stop playing once i decided to take a study break and start a game of civ after 2 hours i began to promise myself that i would be done at the end of the turn each turn every time i finished a turn i would think of all these things i had to do that i might not remember the next time i played i was able to force myself to take a shower probably 6 hours later and right when i got out i ran over and uninstalled the game while i still could
recommended
so i found myself at war with many countries while playing as japanthen ghandi contacted metold me he was sad to see me such a warmongererits the year 2000 me and ghandi are nuking everyone as an alliance eventually when it was me and ghandi as the final nations ghandi continued to stay alliancebut mehehehi betrayed ghandi nuking the hell out of himits about time ghandi tasted his own medicine
recommended
it is probably one of my favorite games ever so with the mods i can just about do anything with this this game is super fun eventhough i play on the easy mode i love the game bc of the wonders im a wonderfreak so this game provides it the graphics and gamestyle make it to the point that it isnt the regular boring turnbased game this game rocks 99910
recommended
are you prepared to use ghandi as your instrument of war against the genghis khan and his ally george washington in a race for nuclear weapons this is a game you play if you have a full month to kill its a game where you start at 7pm and then stop playing at 8am because you have to go to work this is the definition of video game crack
recommended
best game ever i wish there was a scenario maker
recommended
a limitless gaming time so many possibilities and having fun online or single playeror lan one of the best games in that category
recommended
a very good game to spend time along with friends or with mods will accompany you through many hours and longer personally recommend everyone to try it
recommended
this game is addicting when i start i cannot stop ive been playing sid meiers civilization series since forever and i loved every single one of them the only flaw imo is the multiplayer people always leave i hate that anyway 1010
recommended
the game is good with brave new world complete edition is recommended
recommended
very fun 1010 would play again
recommended
while many say its much simpler than civ 4 that doesnt stop it being an absolutley amazing game
recommended
in my opinion civ v with the latest dlcs is the best civ to date exceptional replayability trophies entertainment and balance of course it has been around long enough to hone itself to near perfection easily recommended for any 4x gamer who somehow has never heard of civ or sid meier
recommended
i love this game and reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of strategy 9510
recommended
when you play lan battles with friends do not go to the bathroom somehow like magic almost all of my cities and gold and almost everything somehow came under his control he claims it was the ai that took my stuff still hate gandhi 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010 would reccomend
recommended
playing peacefully the entire game becoming a highly technological civilization gets invaded by a foreign country defends borders agaisnt the invaders gets condemned by the world for being a warmongerer world congress embargoes me builds nukes takes over the world 1110 would take over the world cause i was bullied again
recommended
buy this game if you want to kill any chances of ever having a social life again 1010
recommended
civ v is just amazing i suggest buying it coz its just so much fun
recommended
this is probably the best strategy based game i have ever played  i have played civilization since civ 2  and i can personaly tell you that this game is incredible  it requires skill  while still being a game for casual easy going players the dlc are fantastic and are among the greatest i have ever played  over all it is a well crafted master piece that is a must buy for any gamer looking for a game to test his skills of leadership over all 1010 
recommended
played on deity montezuma spawns right next to me invades me and destroys me in 1 turns 1010 would watch the destruction of my civ again
recommended
superbly handled turn based game that spans throughout the ages perfectly balanced and requires someone actually thinking about the game to succeed easy to understand but hard to master its great seeing how far your civ can come starting from the very beginning with just farms to the end with spaceships giant death robots and nukes this is how a game of the world should be presented
recommended
you see ive owned this game for the past couple months but only in this past week or so i started playing and let me tell you it is nothing short of addictting
recommended
warning more addictive than your favorite designer drug
recommended
its ok played it a couple times
recommended
i dont know how many times ive said just one more turn its to the point where i cant trust myself amazing game
recommended
my most played steam game at least when i had a job where i could get away with it ive spent many enjoyable hours trying in vain to prevet world wars and build an arts culutre based civ would definitely play again for just one more turn
recommended
worth the money
recommended
one of the best
recommended
the only game in which you will be nuked by ghandi and wage war on saudi arabia for taking all your  land you knew you were gonna settle there sorry i got a little carried away there its just that im a little bit absolutely livid anyways here are some pros and cons of civ v pros no longer will you sit down and wait for minutes to go by because gmod has nothing for you to play enjoy being a  to everybody around you with almost no consequence because why would you not play on the easiest difficulty nuclear warfare isnt as bad as it should be one of your cities just exploded make another seven extreme online capabilities mods mods mods cons ghandi saudi arabia ghandi ghandi ing ghandi why ghandi why theres more difficulties than chieftain
recommended
brilliant gameplay challenging when you could face off huge armies against many countires countless armies strategic treeadvancement depending on how you like winning the game love the aspects like creating a religion that would ensure a diplomatic win and such

most addictive game that ive come across in a while each time you play it youre playing a different game 1010
recommended
this game is emaculate in my opinion par the ocassional issue with playing with people across the pond whether you enjoy smashing the ai or making alliances and betraying your friends this game is one of the best strategy games out there for it
recommended
amazingly fun and addictive splurge yourself and get brave new world its seriously the best
recommended
very fun and easy to get into stragety game the only story to speak of is your own civ is know for being addictive and having that one more turn moments in gaming and civ 5 is no different if you get into a really good game it cane have those moments but a boring game not so much in my opinion managing you nation and interacting with the other nations is the thing i enjoy most about civ 5 choosing to eather have peace or got to war with the other nations is what give this game the one more turn moment the ai can also be challanging at times but can be kinda dumb on lower difficultys lucklly this game is easy for new commers and can be hard for veterans ill be honest i suck at civ before i played civ 5 now i understand the mechanics that to the advisor systems and also help for some friends and that the biggest reason to get civ 5 multiplayer get some of you friends into this game and some fights are aruments are bound to break out along with some great fun moments of working together to solve other issues that you nations are having my biggest complanit with this game is how old it gets after about 10 or so games you have a set stragety for sucess and i find myself doing the same thing over and over agian which can get borning also if your with friends expect to wait what can seem like forever for them to finsih there turns and hear them complain about you when your take too long with your turns biggest issue is the bugs that can be annoying expetictly when online but there not game breaking get this and a couple of friend any you will have some funs times like i said i found it to be repeative at times but still very addicting and fun 910

day 86still havent finish my first game
recommended
possibly the greatest and most addicting turn based strategy game ever made it has great graphics and an amazing soundtrack i honestly am hardpressed to find anything to complain about other than the fact that it literally eats my time
recommended
the game is fun u can play with ur friends and conquer the world
recommended
a very fun and a stratagized game
recommended
this game will ruin your life with its one more turn mechanic just last night i was up till 5 in the morning since i just wanted to finish constructing the eifel tower and win a war against arabia this game has taken away much of my life and will continue to do so this is even without me playing any multiplayer 467 hrs and counting of world conquest
recommended
fun strategy game while there are some minor bugs and glitches as well as some minor annoyances there is still that just one more turn play that has been with the civilization series the game looks great and allows many playstyles just be aware of sometimes scumbag ai happiness issues and most of all be prepared for the long haul one game ive been playing accounts for roughly 15 hours of my playtime and im only about 75% done with it this is on standard time and map size and normal difficulty but anyways great game highly recommended
recommended
wonderful 4x strategy game that allows for many different approaches and play styles fun to play difficult to master
recommended
this game will suck the life out of you very addictive very well made and if you have a moster rig as i do you will enjoy it even more
recommended
oh hai i love this game probably one of the best games ive played theres a few things from civ 4 that i would put back in and the expansion is fantastic as well pick this up if you enjoy strategy but keep in mind that 1 game can last up to 8 hours if you survive the early to mid game  i give it 45 meows out of 5 wtf does that mean who knows
recommended
this is an overglorified board game
recommended
ahh civ time vampire extraordinaire not much to say about the fifth installment if you already know the series other than a get both expansions they add largely essential systems into the game religion tourism etc you can usually pick them up in a sale somewhere for pretty cheap now and b picture the sceneits 4am the curtains are still openit must be getting light soon the birds are chirping in the trees you havent moved in the last 8 hours those chores you were going to do yeah umm maybe tomorrowyou should probably think about going to bed but eat my nukes ghandi yep that still happens so 1010 daylight exercise proper diet sleep patterns theyre so overrated anyway
recommended
ill be back to finish this review after my next turn
recommended
as a complete noob to the civ series i got this as a throw in for preordering xcom enemy unknown and was surprised to find i spent probably as many hours in civ as i did in xcom a great game if youve got the time and lots of it
recommended
this game makes even the most unlikely leaders to become warlords including capitalists
recommended
have sank many hours into this game  a rich world and complex strategy game flaws multiple playthroughs can be repetitive ai civilizations are often unpredictable often declaring war on yours for no tangible reason despite previous cooperation i am told that the dlc packs go some way to fixing this
recommended
i have been playing this game wiht my frined and it is alot of fun it is best when you play with your frineds for along time as you play the game just keeps getting better
recommended
absolutely superb game i would reccommend this to anyone especially previous civ players because this game really does bring in additional aspects that have been missing from the fights in previous civs definitely worth buying the dlc in the sale too
recommended
brilliant altough i wouldnt recomend it unless you get the two big dlcs
recommended
civilization v is best enjoyed with the complete edition as it includes several new leaders  countries religion and balances to the game this grand strategy has taken plenty of my hours away in both singleplayer and multiplayer and is far better than beyond earth this is easily the definitive civilization game if you want to get a group of friends together to conquer others
recommended
this game is probably one of my favorite games of all time i sit down on a weekend to play for maybe an hour or so so i start a new game and an hour later a realized that 5 or so hours have passed so then i tell myself just one more turn and 1 turn later 50 turns have passed this game is soooo addicting and i recomend purchasing the complete edition if you do get this game
recommended
this game is well worth the price for singleplayer mode i have spent a lot of time beating the cpus it loses its flavor after about the 10th match but that is what mods and online play is for this game is fun and has endless replayability
recommended
life is done as i know it

one of my favorite games ever i give it 1010
recommended
the game is awesome i recomnd it to people that like strategy games
recommended
505 hours that is all i got to say
recommended
kind of on the fence about this one its definately a good game but in a world where for the same amount of money it asks we can get an amazing game you have to wonder about its true worth gameplay doesnt really get old but the game itself becomes predictable whether or not you realize it you start forming plans for every new game and such the multiplayer is unoptimized and it lacks a lot of the stuff single player has so i dont advise trying it on the positive side there are hundreds of civilizations to play as it has decent combat and some nice smaller things such as a cinematic view when you want it and a strategic view when you need it overall 45 experience
recommended
in love with this game
recommended
apart from a few crashes here and there partially my own error it is an amazing game for best experience you need the dlc
recommended
this is the game i play the most nuff said
recommended
you start out trying to be nice to everyone as they all offer you  deals and denounce you for no reason as you get further and further ahead eventually someone declares war and you having had quite enough of their  bomb them back into the stone age then they offer you horses if youll stop murdering them while in the midst of the modern age you seize one little capital and suddenly everyone in the world hates you for warmongering so you decide to live up to their expectations and conquer the world such is life in civ v  anonymous of fj

very good fun with loads of friends even with the cpus it can be hilarious you can nuke them later game or even just build a massive army and obliterate early game quite hard to do i play this with my friend loads and even some games take up to a whole day and we are yet to finish one but not far off i would recommended this game a lot but only if you like these kind of games stratergy civ v rules review by gunns4l0an
recommended
amazing game but dont expect to play a quick game i have spent over 50 hours on this game at the time of writing this review but have only just finished my first civ simply wonderful strategy game
recommended
attila tried to conquer my city then proced to slam his face against my wall did not work so he gave me a city as an apologize 1010 would recommend
recommended
always a favorite series of mine though each iteration takes some getting used to the expansions really help to flesh out the game
recommended
civilization v is a great game that you can play for over 250 hours and still not know every tactic or strategy and youll never beat it its a strategic game where not building that one military unit could be your downfall overall a solid game 810
recommended
highly addictive
recommended
ever wondered if you could go back in time and change the past ever thought about how did earlier major civilizations rose and fell as soon as they were in power or do you just simply enjoy watching paint dry then this is the game for you choose your favourite civilization over a vast collection and find out why they started sucking so hard before entering medieval age witness how an ally decides to stab your back after being best friends for a over centuries just because you didnt answer their demands this game offers a great opportunity to feel like being in charge of everything inside a civilization and if the computer ai started making you mad try out the multiplayer and invite your dearest friends soon youll end up having vicious fights about someone making their decisions for hours you will love getting revenge on those wasted minutes this game is a 55 and a great pick for some mild lan parties

author background welcome to my first ever review have fun reading and hoping this review can inform andor enrich you in any way a short introduction of myself and then lets start reviewing im a 35 year old male civilizationveteran who has been playing the civfranchise since the release of the first civilization married have two adorable young sons onto hopefully my knowledge and enthousiasm might spread residing in belgium europe important changes towards previous versions the biggest and one of the best changes in my opinion are the new hexagonal tiles versus the old square tiles this concept isnt new and was already being used in other older strategyhistory gamessims it makes you wonder why it took until civ5 before using these now it feels right when moving units around the map in older versions of civ it always felt like a bit of cheating to move a unit diagonally from one square tile to another suppose you could not move diagonally you would need double the movement points to move around squares forming a corner now while you can move diagonally you gain a distinct distance advantage while doing so 14 distance against 1 while moving straight diagonalsqrt2length 1414sqrt21 in a hexagonal system movement in all 6 directions measure the same distance size does matter the most pleasant change for me was the new combat system related to distance units just how cool was it to let it rain arrows and havoc upon your foes with that newly build archery unit besieging cities is much more fun now than it used to be the fact that hills andor mountains block range doesnt only add a bit of unit realism but is definitely a very important strategic implement because of units cant form stacks on tiles anymore they should be looked at as individual armies combine this with the reduced number of tiles max 6 instead of max 8 coming from the new hex grid directly surrounding a city you really have to think twice when positioning units to launch a coordinated city assault also bearing in mind the possibility for units to retreat to safe distance for healing these changes grant so much more strategic depth than in civ5s predecessors in fact civ5 is the first version im perfectly happy with when it comes to strategy like with any other older version of the game it all looks a bit better from the maps cities units unit animations menus etc everything is visually improved content vanilla version comes with 18 civilizations with 7 civs available in dlc and respectively 9 and 9 more with the expansions gods & kings and brave new world making a total of 43 civilizations to beat the game with each of the civs having their unique leader together with hisher personal traits and unique unitsbuildings map sizes range from duel very small to huge not having checked this thoroughly my guess is that the huge map is much larger than the greatest size in civ4 and by huge i do mean huge steam hooray civilization 5 is affiliated with steam this brings the community closer to the gamer its a great resource for free downloadable mods and guides discussion forums etc basically all the advantages steam gives to a gamer can be enjoyed now as well in your favorite strategy game civ 5 should be personally i just adore the steam achievements a welcome addition in a game that can be played over and over again with randomly generated maps over time i found it rather hard to keep playing when ive beaten and lost the game so often that no realultimate goal remained steam achievements solved this motivation problem for me i also concluded my gamingstyle improved due to the variation of games i had to play to unlock achievements my ultimate goal is to unlock all 287 of them and be rewarded a perfect game hope to do this before civ 6 is released at the time im writing this review i got 96 unlocked with 203 hours played downsides yes in a game so developed and grown over even a decade there are some downsides i have to mention first of all the ai you can begin to notice repetitive predictable ai behavior having played for lets say over 150 hours this is not new in comparison to older versions and i understand this is something that can remain an issue over a longer period of time in the future from now a computer remains a programmed machine right this may not be a problem to online gamers who play against other humans but i play civ against ai for 99% of the time also when playing on higher difficulty levels the benefits the computer controlled civs get become too prominent and annoying frustrated me especially on the two highest difficulty levels immortal and deity i recommend king and emperor levels for experienced players maybe immortal on smaller andor duelsized maps deity simply is too insane to spent too much time on another minor downside may be the fact firaxis removed religion from the game in the vanilla version that is with the installment of gods & kings religion can be brought back although it is implemented differently like it was in civ4 i must add some civspecific units might be overunderpowered towards other civspecific units all in all if this is all downside i can think of firaxis created another great title conclusion a truly musthave for every fan of the civilization franchise a great recommendation for everyone who loves turnbased strategy games with the game being released for years now the civilization 5 complete pack all dlc expansions gods & kings and brave new world is regularly on sale and can be purchased for less than 15 usd 12 having bought the complete pack myself for 13 its the best 13 ever spent so far buy this asap and start growing civilized even more greetings have fun
recommended
great strategy game from the civilization series the first one ive tried after getting this though ive since looked back at what it came from and it came from the excellent god father of strategy games civilization i absolutely great multiplayer still a little clunky but works very well when it gets going oh and theres a lot of great mods for this thing through steam workshop too which couldnt make it easier
recommended
great game with lots of hours of gameplay multiplayer and singleplayer well done 2k games for a great strategy if you want a pack i would recommend getting complete edition as it comes with most dlcs and is worth the money great game great game looking forward to the future of the game 
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played even better with dlc
recommended
starting the game up saying to yourself gonna play for 1 hour 25 hours later oh this hour went by quickly
recommended
its awesome and enjoyable like it so much
recommended
this game is amazing even though it has been out for a few years civilization v is becoming one of my favorite strategy games on steam
recommended
it is great garenteed to give you hours of amazing gameplay
recommended
best game ever hands down
recommended
in my opinion its the best strategygame i ever played cant wait for beyond earthgonna be great d 1010
recommended
very time consuming but very fun as well 1010
recommended
cant believe ive put 750 hours into this game over the years think that kind of says enough i love strategy games and sid meier does them best many people didnt like the new mechanics of civ v compared to other previous civs but actually i kind of liked them in fairness the ai really isnt all that appealing it kind of cheats to win and isnt all too bright but i love building my civs and taking on the world for domination
recommended
oh ill just play a little to pass some time next thing you know its the next day 1110
recommended
its a great game takes forever and a day to finish a game even though you can save at points the maps are huge and strategical planning is vital its very entertaining fun with friends if you plan to have a couple days to play it
recommended
quite a chill relaxing game which takes alot of thought to it quite fun trying to alter history like having the pentagon in russia or having the great pyramids of england
recommended
played 11 hours from 4 pm to 3 am and then woke up hen next morning and played it till around 2 pm so i guess you could say that it is an okay game
recommended
very enjoyable gameplay intense when other top civilizations declare war on you but if you can pick up on things quickly they can be easy to beat
recommended
look im reccomending a game
recommended
great game
recommended
good game to play with a some freinds better with the dlc
recommended
ive spent so much time in this game that its not even funny at least when noting the fact that ive yet to actually finish a game seriously i love this game though it can get a little tiring in the later stages of the games
recommended
this game is great to play with friends and is extremely enjoyable its a blast to play with others as you make alliances trade with other civs and race to make the best civilization single player mode is also quite fun though some of the ais are strange and the diplomacy is awkward still though the higher difficulties can pose quite a challenge i would definitely reccomend it to someone else as a game they could get sucked into for hours on end
recommended
one of the best strategy games of all time 
recommended
when i purchased sid meiers civilization v i had no idea what i was getting into note people have said you need the complete edition dlcs and such to make the game better and theyre soooo right being someone who has played with and without the dlcs i strongly reccomend buying the complete edtion over the standard edition i played 7 hours in my first real sitting of civ v and started out as playing alexander ruler of greece which was fun and all but i didnt really enjoy playng as him after that i convinced some friends of mine to get the game since it was on sale and now ill mostly play multiplayer with my friends they all now love civilization v also and they always thank me for having them buy it graphics  8510 gameplay  910 replayability 910 personal rating  1010 game ps never trust ghandi
recommended
played this for about 8 hours when i first bought it all night then went to school and work i accidentally had a 7 hour nap later that day then i woke up and played it again 1010

recommended
awesome strategy game that gets very indepth and can be really fun with friends a lot of unique civs to play as with their own special unitsabilities definitely worth it to buy the game and the dlc
recommended
civ v is perhaps the pinnacle on turned based strategy games with the gods  kings expansion it rivals the more hardcore civ iv one unit per tile along with hexagonal tiles makes for interesting and tactically invigorating battles no longer will the bigger stack of dooms rule the battlefield rivers hills and line of sight all play factors in combat now multiplayer with friends is fun and interesting and the ai will be a good learning tool to get the hang of the game a game worth buying if you enjoy turn based strategy
recommended
an immersive slow paced and very strategic turn based game that is as deep as it is challenging if you consider yourself a smart gamer or love strategic and turn based games then you are doing yourself a disservice by not buying this game
recommended
i love strategy games but not only that i love destroying my friends civ

recommended
if you like strategy this is the game for you having piled a lot of hours into this game i find that you really need lots of friends to play this game online to get a proper solid experience i find that you can only dominate the bots a few dozen games until you get bored also a fantastic thing about it is that it keeps growing and changing the teams still working on it and best of all each match can run for several hours if not days add to all of that the fact that you can at any time play with one of the many mods available and youve got a great experience 1010
recommended
good game get it if you like strategy
recommended
the best turnbased history game ever 1010 but all the dlcs are a must or else it is horrible
recommended
best civ game yet the combat is more strategic because units can no longer stack on top of each other so you must protect your catapults flank with your horses etc the multiplayer is also really good you can do coop multiplayer vs ai and save the game for multiple playing sessions also the multiplayer lets players who crash rejoin the game which is pretty nice overall worth the money youll play this game for many hours get it and play some mp matches with me p
recommended
tons of fun
recommended
910 if youre looking for a strategy game look no further this is the strategy game even with the release of other similar games and even civilization beyond earth this game still holds out as the best strategymanagement game on the market this game is easy to get into but still has layers and layers of depth and minmaxing to be done if thats your thing this is my most played game on steam and i recommend it to any fan of the genre be warned though multiplayer is quite buggy
recommended
graphically superior to any other turn based strategy game i know civ v is my favorite platform for historical inaccuracies you may not be much for strategy games but nuking ghandi never gets old i give it a 7810 but with gods and kings i would give it a 910 i might also mention that the max graphics look like an oil painting
recommended
an addiction a lifestyle
recommended
reviews are subjective civ is a slow paced turn based strategy if you like strategy and dont mind spending an evening playing a single game then give the game a shot civ does have some aspects that cater to players who prefer shorter games but realistically this is for those of us with high attention spans i enjoy it and think it is a solid game there are obviously things i dislike and negative aspects but again reviews tend to be too critical of utterly banal things so i will avoid that and just say i like it if you have the money and you like strategy try it out if not no huge loss 
recommended
this game is very interesting though deity level is quite tough
recommended
this game if one of the best i have played it continues the legacy of sid mieres and is just great i reccomend the dlcs it really changes the game in a lot of great ways which range form maps to civs and adds a new kick to the game
recommended
an extremely fun and complex strategy game
recommended

this game really packs allot of things to say  its alot of things combined and a really fun game  multiplayer in this game is super and all the elements of this game work great  all thou it gets boring sometimes yet you can always play this with out regreat  its really fun and thanks to sid meier for this masterpiece
recommended
i dont even need security clearances to fire a nuke 42010
recommended
for long time fans of the series this makes some pretty dramatic changes the ramifications of which may not be obvious at first glance the removal of unit stacking leads to strategic city placement and the dramatic increase in the use of artillery units for once even on the easier difficulty levels bombers and artillery play a part instead of just stacking 15 tanks in one tile purchasing tiles and units feels almost like cheating in the best of ways if you enjoy 4x games give this an honest shot it may take a bit of time but soon youll wonder how you ever enjoyed playing the old way
recommended
by far one of the best games out today still a lot of fun to play
recommended
ii dont really remember much about what happened these last two weeks i just coukdnt stop my self 1510 would do it again
recommended
get this game its my first steam game and i love it theres no two tries that are the same and many ways to win

1110 one of the best games ive ever played sid meier again makes a fabulous game smooth gameplay and infinite replay value make it top notch with more than a dozen awesome civs and dlc that is very much worth the purchase its a game i asbolutely love cant wait for civilization beyond earth
recommended
if you get the dlcexpansions this game is almost as good as civ 4

if i could only play one and only one game for a year this would be it you will lose all your time playing this
recommended
if you want to play a board game but cant be bothered to set it up then empire earth is the game for you
recommended
fantastic strategy game especially with freinds to play a game of politics backstabbing and war among other things
recommended
an exceptional strategy game which can have you playing different styles every game making it a very diverse game while i wouldnt recommend the base game it is definitely worth getting the game with the main dlc which overhaul some of the game mechanics
recommended
an immersive slow paced and very strategic turn based game that is as deep as it is challenging if you consider yourself a smart gamer or love strategic and turn based games then you are doing yourself a disservice by not buying this game
recommended
warning dont buy this if your intent is to live a normal life on the other hand you should definitely buy civ 5 if you want an awesome game that will make you say one more freaking turn until its 3am
recommended
one of the nicer strategy games around after civ3 this one is offering enough newer aspects to spend many hours puzzling a real recommendation for everyone
recommended
civilization 5 often passes off as a slight downgrade from other civ games many of its initial concepts can steer away previous civ fans who enjoyed features that are now simplified but what they dont realise is how much more this game offers to make up for it the hexagon system of tiles is one of the greatest ideas theyve ever had  no longer is it more efficient to move diagonally than it is in any other direction as with hexagons no direction is any more efficient than another the worlds have grown in size to an astonishing amount when maxed out and the units now feel much more like true squads or platoons rather than board game pieces with their large visual numbers and more advanced battle animations not to mention vastly improved graphics units also can no longer be stacked on top of one another  each tile is limited to only 1 military and 1 civilian settlerworkergreat person meaning you cant stack entire armies ready to march on the enemys capital with certain destruction in a matter of only 1 turn as you could in previous titles overall everything this game does feels so much better than the previous games in the series they did a fantastic job polishing it to the point of once again holding its point as the greatest strategy game ever
recommended
this game is so great thought really change the name to life wasting simulator 1210 settler immedialty got taken by barbarians 1010 would waste life again
recommended
lost days in it playing it normally or with the dlc is great you cant lose its beyond addiction

epic turnbased strategy game build your civilization from anciet era to modern era its not just about war and battle there are many ways to win through science culture or diplomacy take a long time to finish a game around a day but thats why its epic

it feels very good to decimate and obliterate the inferior civilizations that stand against your glorious reign

sid meiers civilization v the current leader in the 4x strategy and with good reason it is extremely simple to get at least a basic grasp on without paying too much attention to the more hardcore aspects of it by managing resources and cities much more deeply which are there for those who like more of a challenge civ v also features prominant civilizations who knew through time and mixing these all together makes a very compelling experiences where you can mould your own countries history into something completely different to what happened in real life to this point it is also worth mentioning that i almost always play with mods from the workshop that really add to the experience such as my favorites being the realworld maps so i can spread my new english empire across a far more accurate world after being ever so nice to all my neighbours before taking their land away civ v also looks pretty nice in 3d which is rare to come by and i doubt many have attempted it the game runs quite easilly with the exception of turn changes so most systems should handle it and there is a very fufilling sense of awe in being able to see the details of lighthouses and birds seen in 3d overall civ v is a great experience to any history nutt or gaming strategist of any sort but make sure you get all the expansions alongside it because youll kick yourself over your lost civilizations and features that can improve the game and overhaul your approach to it

stay calm and dont trust ghandi or hiawatha youll pay for it if you do 1010 30 mins becomes 4 hours just juan more turn you say that becomes 2 then 5 then 10 then before you know it 100

if you like strategy this is the game for you having piled a lot of hours into this game i find that you really need lots of friends to play this game online to get a proper solid experience i find that you can only dominate the bots a few dozen games until you get bored also a fantastic thing about it is that it keeps growing and changing the teams still working on it and best of all each match can run for several hours if not days add to all of that the fact that you can at any time play with one of the many mods available and youve got a great experience 1010
recommended
good game get it if you like strategy
recommended
lots of depth to gameplay it really requires you to think
recommended
would recomend that you get it
recommended
this game has great graphics and super fun gameplay highly recommended 5 stars
recommended
if you plan on getting this game be warned you will spend hours and hours of your time playing civilization v it is so addictive and has huge replayability with 5 different victory types and over 20 different civilizations to play as definatly of my favorite games ever 11 out of 10
recommended
great strategy game that never bores you immersive content such as trade routes epionage new civs world congress etc makes the dlc a must have if you dont have a life best game ever and if you do prepare not to i higly recommend
recommended
sid meiers civilization v otherwise known as civ has been and continues to be one of my favourite games on pc the first civ game i ever played lasted about 4 hours and was a magical experience while the games after that werent quite as special the replayability of this game is unprecidented with all of the features and dlc that exist its easy to find a new way to play the game and have fun with it this brings me to my only complaint about the game the dlc while very good are just too expensive there are 2 of them that are really worth getting which are gods & kings and brave new world which each cost 30$ on their own which is the price of the original game thankfully all the civ dlc go on sale frequently for about $750 so there isnt too much to gripe about so long as youre patient in conclusion civ is an addictive nation building strategy game that never gets old has great features and extras as well as a great multiplayer experience i would highly reccommend it  9610
recommended
i have no doubts that this is the best tbs out there very addictive has plenty of replay ability and gives you something fun to do on those boring rainy days and if your not a fan of buying dlcs or just dont like the dlc for this game in general you could always get community created ingame civilizations and mods for free my only complaint is the bug which occurs sometimes when you get late into a game that causes the whole thing to crash as long as you save every 510 turns near the end of the game you should be good  910
recommended
there are so many add ons get them all soooo much fun
recommended
pretty good civilization game but you must get the dlcs for it to fully experience what it has
recommended
yes is awesome
recommended
never ending cycle of backstabbing between friends only downside is it takes too much time to finish a game other than that its pretty fun
recommended
dont expect to play this game for an hour at a time
recommended
best game on steam must buy
recommended
fantastic if you have a lot of time to burn turn based strategy aglore there is a bit of a learning curve but after two games it is pretty easy to get a hang of the game the mechanics tons of civilizations throughout history have been included this game is pretty addictivie and i highly recommend the expansion packs as well one more turn
recommended
civilization v 5 is a tbs turned based strategy that lets you play as a famous world leader in history you must build up your empire with both complicated and simplistic commands make your empire flourish and rise launch into both golden ages and battles destroy the other civilizations of the world through military conquest scientific ingenuity cultural superiority peaceful negotiations peh who uses that anyway or be the best of the best before time comes to a halt its your decision can your empire stand the test of time
recommended
if you like turnbased strategy games then civilization is one of the best out there you select from a list of historical civilizations and then you get to play through all of human history all the while selecting the best path to victory in a variety of ways the only con i could nitpick is that you will spend almost all your time on this game it is so compelling get it
recommended
you can play weeaboo nippon master race 1010
recommended
one of my favorite games of all time great ui great design highly addictive gameplay i spent so many hours on a campaign with alexander the great that i still never finished great game for hours upon hours of strategic turnbased fun also great as a potential tool for teaching people about new historical aspects they werent previously aware of
recommended
the pinnacle of one of the best strategy game series of all time
recommended
great game really thought i recommend buying atleast the brave new world expansion before playing
recommended
one of the best stategy world builder games out there
recommended
possibly one of the most amazing games ever created hours of endless fun
recommended
the standard for turnbasedstrategic game deep and challening i suggest to invest a few hours before deciding if it is for you but you are minimally interested in the genre just go for it and the day will just goby 55
recommended
i love this game a hole lot more then my hours put in show but thats because i dont have the time to play it because it takes so long for each match but trust me steam user its worth it
recommended
very good but annoying due to sweaty nerds
recommended
good game many kingdoms game is based on age of empires and heroes series with 1 word that game is the best 1010
recommended
this game is a brilliant game with near infinite possibilities and perfectly suited to the tactical mind there are lots of dlcs to expand the game including many new leaders and senarios pros wonderful graphics self explanatory gameplay for beginners multiple modes multiplayer cons multiplayer is slightly buggy overall this game is a brilliant buy and i definately agree with the metacritics who gave it a metascore of 90
recommended
a great historically accurate strategy game
recommended
you defently wanna buy this great game many science many wow much war doge out
recommended
i must say its a must have lots of hours in this game and its cool buy it
recommended
a very good stratergy game
recommended
amazing game i totally recommend it
recommended
the closest i have ever come to playing a game like civ on the computer is risk way back when it was probably one of the top games on pcs turn based never held my interest before as i have always preferred rts to get my battle on but catching a good sale and having a friend at work who played it quite a lot recommend this game repeatedly i decided to take the dive i have to say i thoroughly enjoy this game now and have bought even other previous versions and even the beyond earth civ i keep going back to this one though as it feels the most complete of them all and i definately have the one more turn addiction that seems to come with these sort of games of all the turned based strategy i have tried i find myself coming back to this title i did get it with all the dlc which i have read does make the game quite a lot better so i would recommend grabbing the complete edition if you are buying this great title better have some time on your hands as this one can be very addictive
recommended
civ 5 is one of those games where you look at the clock and 6 hours have passed a game where you will stay on for one more turn 1010 would buy again
recommended
i played it a bit its ok
recommended
it is really really fun i got it not really knowing what it truly was i just wanted to make the 2k sale worth it but when i started playing i was immediately entranced i recomend it to not only fans but everyone
recommended
playing as japan and conquering everything nuked by gandi would play and get nuked again 1110
recommended
great game one of my favorites in my library
recommended
life lessons learned from civ 1 gandhis a warmongering  2 poland can into space 3 america is the weakest nation on the planet 4 genghis khan was a horrible military tactician 5 montezuma is an immortal  thus concludes the most accurate history lesson you will ever receive

1010 would foolishly trust gandhi again
recommended
fairly dank
recommended
most addictive game ever
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
if you like strategy games this is definitely a must have wonderful gameplay game development and hours of great fun
recommended
this game expands and expands to no end its very time consuming but much like a good chess game its a lot of fun you have to give it a try try getting it on sales as it goes down to about $750 for the whole game with expansion packs
recommended
very nice game hard to understand at first but you get used to it also lots of guides of this game
recommended
put your hand on your heart and say youve never physically or mentally said to yourself one more turn 1110
recommended
this is one of the best games ive ever played
recommended
whenever i watch any  literally any  movie or television show not set in the modern area it makes me want to play civilization thats right any time period before like now thats a lot of time folks and there are a lot of times i abandon whatever i was interested in watching to play civilization so join me wont you please note i dont actually want to play civilization with you i prefer to play with the ai opponents who have become my best friends and confidantes im looking at you attila
recommended
it took awhile to understand how everything works but after that greatness ensures
recommended
really good game 
recommended
nice update as opposed to civ 4
recommended
one of my favourites a fantastically realized world reimaginer make sure to buy the complete edition for the full experience
recommended
this game is fantastic i love the new hex tiles it makes if feel like the settlers of katan board gamealso the fact there can only be one military and one civilian unit per tile is great i play coop with my friends all the time
recommended
great fun but many friendships were ruined
recommended
chose random leader for my first game of civ 5 rolled gandhi set out to build a nice little empire everyone was happy and well fed cotton and whales were plentiful and wonders were constructed to inspire my people then montezuma showed up he wanted my land my people my wonders so i crushed him his empire burned beneath the feet of my armies and his capital crumbled by their hands but it would not stop there my bloodlust would not be satisfied until every nation on the planet met their brutal demise and meet it they did one by one until the green of india spanned the globe it remains the most true to form i have every played a civ leader 1010 would be  gandhi again
recommended
should have stemmed my multiyear impulse to get back into the civ shiz for one week lol
recommended
extremely fun and relaxing and is great to play with friends gaming can last for hours and a time
recommended
the game that reveals gandis true ambishens to rule the world
recommended
barbarians shot down my fighter jet with clubs 42010
recommended
awesome game if you are a leader and if you want to build and lead your own civilization this game is for you and you will have fun playing it for hours and hours very addicting careful 910
recommended
okay tis the big one civilization v my favourite game besides team fortress 2 i cant decide which one i like more they are so different to play to enjoy ect but i can say you this buy the dlcs not only gods & kings and brave new world but also the dlcs adding new civilizations like spain the inka denmark korea babylon if you wanna try out this game wait for a sale this turnbased strategy game isnt a game for everybody so when the sale comes when this game is on sale its nearly always 75% on the game and every dlc buy this game including gods & kings and brave new world i just love this game and i know many people who do aswell 
recommended
very fun game reminds me of age of empires i would like to see the persian immortals look a little like they did back in the day the game is perfect i love the scenarios and everything about it i would love to see a siege weapon that could fire from 3 tiles away before the artillery it would be much easier to lay siege to a city 5 stars
recommended
the music gives you aids
recommended
too busy taking another turn to right a review but this game is genius
recommended
i have spent so much time on this game it is sad almost 1500 more offline
recommended
best damn strategy game ive ever played no complaints money very well spent game is crisp no two playthroughs are alike and its diversity constantly keeps you enthralled in the game be a trading civ cultural civ science or liberate others as murica doesnt matter what you do its a fun game if a normal game takes too long for your taste you can even set it go quicker than normal definitely amongst my top 5 games ever played grab a copy try to get the complete edition the expansions add a lot of features and add me i can help you learn the ropes
recommended
it is very interesting game i love it a lot
recommended
i bought it 10 days ago its okay
recommended
love it
recommended
this game is amazingchears 
recommended
im coming up to 100hrs in civ 5 so its probably about time i gave it some praise make sure you get the complete edition on sale for around 8 in a sale civ is a turnbased strategy game in which you build you empire across a randomly generated map you compete against friends and ai to win the game how you win is up to you the game is at its best when its played in a boardgame night fashion with friends get in google hangouts or mumble and chill out the games last forever so dont expect a quick fix if you have 2 monitors the game gets even better when you can easily switch between civ and whatever making those late game turns less of a bore i really enjoy civ its a lovely game for playing with friends and passing time its a staple in most peoples steam libaries and if its on sale you should definately pick up the complete edition
recommended
brilliant game civ 5 has a very good single player experience although is amazing with friends in multiplayer the only negative i have for this game is that as of yet there seems to be no way to make the multiplayer ai any more or less difficult the only way to change the pace would be to put a handicap on yourself to get the full experience of the game i suggest getting both of the expansion packs also as this doubles the games content and replay ability i highly recommend this game to anyone
recommended
very time consuming but very fun as well 1010
recommended
help me i cant stop other then the fact that its one of the most addicting games out there it also has some very good dlc that adds a lot of variety if you have the extra money
recommended
you want to recreate hitlers regime maybe become the next stalin how bout bending queen elizibeth over and ing her in the  with your nuclear diplomacy civ v is for you
recommended
yellow jam would like if he learnt how to play 1010
recommended
this is civilisation intitally i couldnt get into the hex grid which was a departure from the earlier games however after a while i barely noticed it the expansions have only added to this if you havent played this by now and it is your type of game then you need to own this and what is wrong with you get it at any price
recommended
poland can into space from now on
recommended
most additive game i have ever played
recommended
a well made game includes tons of fun and opportunity to learn a little about historie while playing
recommended
its a great gamebut you should get and least gods and kings to go with it
recommended
i think this game quite enjoyable
recommended
good game is all i can say scratch that awesome game
recommended
this is a very fun adicting game it has some of the most well known leaders of ancient times this game brings all cizilaations together
recommended
nuke everybody as gandhi
recommended
do you want to know what it is like to be addicted then buy the game and forget about sleep lifeand friends to me this game is more fun singleplayer than multiplayer
recommended
definitely worth your money when it is on sale and even still when not a wide variety of empires to select and each one of them have their own abilities i was playing a match with my friends for over 7 hours its super addicting the games last for a long time and over time you research different abilities like being able to have your units go into the water get on boats and sail along the coast also there is an ability to go into deeper waters to cross the ocean and meet a friend or take over a civilization a really good game to spend your money on
recommended
absolutely wonderful and addictive
recommended
1010 with dlc
recommended
best game franchise ive ever played pros hours of replayability not like any other game con error 404 not found with the almost 1000 hours on my record easily i could say the best casual and competeitive game ever
recommended
very fun to play either offline or online with friends team up with friends and rule the world together or fight your friends and beat them in differents ways win thru world domination or if you prefer a more peacefull approach just build the united nations and make world peace a dream come thru no matter what you will have lots of fun and you can play this game for end on end
recommended
great game just buy it
recommended
a wonderful strategy game that you can just lose yourself in for hours
recommended
me and my friend bought this game on sales and i have to say it is a lot of fun but time consuming i know i havent played for that long but i recomend it is awesome and a lot of fun with friends
recommended
dont expect to play this game for an hour at a time
recommended
best game on steam must buy
recommended
there are so many add ons get them all soooo much fun
recommended
pretty good civilization game but you must get the dlcs for it to fully experience what it has
recommended
yes is awesome
recommended
its surprisingly good never thought id like a strategy game but civ v really did changed my mind if you are going to buy civ i recommend buying the complete edition
recommended
chipotle took over america 999\10
recommended
killing ur time baby but as the return you should have a lot of fun
recommended
legendary game
recommended
yeah is preety good 1010 would bang
recommended
very detailed strategy game i like the multiplayer feature
recommended
really fun game i bought the the complete edition which i would recommened without brave new world and gods and kings you really have a bare 4x strategy game with the dlc you get a great game but also have the opportunities to help with diplomacy countries and maps lovely music and is a great game watch for gandhi 910
recommended
ill write a full review in a minute just let me have one more turn
recommended
beware serious chances of finding yourself in the onemoreturn mode in 6am great game cant wait to see the beyond earth thing
recommended
it kills me to think about the cumulative human time spent playing this game
recommended
alone ok game with the dlcs great game its a mass world conquest game and it will take you about forty hours to complete a campain so if you like having a lack of time and mass amounts of fun this is the game for you and im not going to explian what it is because its a commonly known game and if you really need to know watch a lets play of it or aj reveiw on it that will get the idea of what it is acrossed
recommended
starts out with a plan to win by culture starts rapidly expanding my borders another nation has a cultural advantage over me f it conquer everyone 1110 would conquer again
recommended
gud but not great 
recommended
abosutely loves this game totally addicting i would recommend getting all the dlc as it adds so much to the total experiece from the game
recommended
ive wasted far too many hours on this game no regrets
recommended
brilliant game a lot of fun
recommended
great game with with great expansions
recommended
the only valid reason for any strategy game lover to not have and love this game is the fear for your life and by that i dont mean dying i just mean having it tick away via seconds and minutes and inevitably hours sunk into this game its addicting but luckily its a sort of benign addiction in that after you finally do wipe the smile from ramallamadingdongs face and crush the siamese army with battleships and b2s you can look upon a world uniformly flying your colors and feel satisfied it might lack some of the finer points of control and systems that games like europa universalis or a couple of previous iterations of civ had but i feel it was a fair trade for how approachable it is civ 5 is extremely easy to learn but difficult to master even after as many hours as ive sunk into it im still learning new strategies and how to deal with challenges and theres no lack of depth here in vanilla civ 5 yes but with the expansions no its a great strategy game to dive into thats unintimidating for the newbies and deep enough for the hardcore
recommended
after spending 85 hours on civ v with all the expansions i am amazed at the power and magnatude of the things on this game the possibilities are really endless and the one more turn motif never really gets old besides i can mine salt and nuke things
recommended
definitely my favorite civilization so far the new systems for winning especially culture and much more streamlined and understandable than previous civ games the fact that you no longer can stack units on the same space is also definitely a plus best strategy game on the market not a huge fan of the expansion though
recommended
one of the most satisfying turn based strategy games out there get the game together with the two expansions
recommended
the only reason i own a pc
recommended
great game reccomend to anybody who finds themselves interested in 4x strategy games able to capture your attention time and time again due to fantastic modding community and great fun to play with friends only downside is that when firaxis updates the game there are some game breaking bugs for a while when playing multiplayer but they generally get ironed out fairly quickly
recommended
if you like turnbased strategy games then civilization is one of the best out there you select from a list of historical civilizations and then you get to play through all of human history all the while selecting the best path to victory in a variety of ways the only con i could nitpick is that you will spend almost all your time on this game it is so compelling get it
recommended
you can play weeaboo nippon master race 1010
recommended
a very good stratergy game
recommended
21 hours in 4 days i think im addicted this game is incredible a must play
recommended
there are whole novels im never going to have the time to write because of this damn game 2010
recommended
an excellent strategy game fun playing and challenging play as some of the historical nations that are in the game or get mods from the workshop and play some other nation that you would like to play as you can also play with your friends both multiplayer and hot seat play this game  super fun play with friends  double the fun
recommended
this is a great game and has good multiplayer
recommended
okay ill just make a water mill in my new city and its 5 in the morning already
recommended
i have played a number of civilization games across several platforms but this one takes the cake i keep wanting to play it over and over and over again if you have responsibilities or due dates or anything that is time sensitive i reccomend you to prioritize and make sure you finish real life things first because as soon as you start turn 1 theres no going back sleepless nights have been spent whispering the shadows of my dark room just one more turn 1010
recommended
having never palyed a civilization game before this was quite a foreign concept i had watched my friend play it a little bit and understood the basics from general knowledge either way i bought it on a sale and dont regret it played my first game went total warmonger and fought the world and won pros easy to understand complex for veterans workshop unique ai each posing their own unique threat cons ai is as thick as bricks multiplayer is apalling far less features than single player and frequent and extremely irritating bugs and connectivity issuesunrelated to the client not being updated frequently and any update is usually a bugfix of some sort ridiculously expensive the dlc is pretty much a requirement to enjoy the game fully and said dlc is very expensive overall an absolutely brilliant game however it is too expensive if you have been turned off by the price i understand currently if you choose to buy all the dlc individually if would cost you 136 euros however a full edition is available for 45 this number is too big if you wait for a sale you can pick up the complete edition for 15 euros a puurchase you will not regret
recommended
this game taught me more history than my 12 years of public education
recommended
really love this turnbased strategy game
recommended
dont buy it if you have an addictive personality its good
recommended
i think this would be one of the best strategy games i have ever played if it was a bit more expanded played a few matches w a friend and its good but gets a bit boring after a little while bots are a bit easy once you get the hang of the game enjoyable nonetheless definitely worth the purchase i got it for $20 along with gods & kings expansion 810
recommended
game thats easy to grasp compared to other strategy games yet very deep the first 10 hours will feel really impossible to understand but once you get the general concepts the real fun begins the amount of flexibility  possibilities and mods make it a game you can easily dump hours on
recommended
spent few hours with this one had great time
recommended
a game i recommend to anyone that likes strategy games its a mustown 1010
recommended
1110 would nuke berlin as poland again
recommended
a phenomal game that will make you appreciate history prepare to spend many hours playing this game
recommended
basicly like this become a dictator
recommended
this game is awesome as an age of empires player i thought i would have a great basis for this game yet it proved wrong this game is way more complicated then aoe at first when i bought it i thought it was too hard so i quit this week a few months after buying i tried again and im hooked the game is very hard to understand there are so much things you have to think of but thats the attractive part finally not a game like csgo cod or gta where you just run and gun without thinking but a game that actually makes you think and rethink your actions and challenges you only con of this game is that it will eat your time when you think you have been playing for an hour youre whole day has gone bye the onemoreturnsymdrom is very strong in this game 1010 would buy again
recommended
fun if you have an entire day to do nothing but play
recommended
do you see how many hours i have played in this game nuff said 
recommended
this is possibly the best game ive ever bought period
recommended
1010 would play for another 8 years
recommended
pro great turnbased strategy timeline evolution very easy to learn endless replayability awesome singleplayer good graphics for its genre calming soundtrack many different game setups fun city management lots to build upgrade and research game gives suggestions on what to build upgrade or research decent diplomaticy system action > reaction for example expand your territory near other civilizations > they might get angry > they might denounce you > other civilizations might distrust you > every civilization turns against you > nukes > new game steam workshop con diplomacy system is not perfect for example when demanding another civilization to stop spying on you most of the time or atleast when they dislike you they tell you that theyre trying to steal research to keep their people safe from you whatever the outcome of that conversation about 1 turn later that civilization contacts you again to tell you that they are sorry you can then tell them that you forgive them or not but whatever you choose they will always try to spy on you again later on even if you have a much bigger army than them it seems that they dont care about risking a war announcement from your side loading time of startingloading a game takes a bit too long verdict even though i expected more from the diplomacy system this is still the best and easiest to learn turnbased strategy game i have ever played dlc are a must have to enjoy it to the fullest keeps you hooked for many many hours 910 what to buy i highly recommend getting the full game package the dlc are a must for the full experience even with workshop possibilities ps most players find civ 5 a better game than the latest civ beyond earth i feel the same way about this beyond earth is far from a bad game but it just doesnt keep me hooked the way civ 5 does the fact that civ 5 can be played with all its dlc and that beyond earth has no big dlc out yet probably plays a big part in it overal be feels incomplete civ 5 has also aged very well it doesnt look dated at all compared to the latest installment
recommended
nuked everyone death and destruction everywhere 1010 you are gonna get addicted to this if you like turn based games
recommended
when i was a little boy i always wanted to play a game in which i could start on ancient era and go through next eras up to future era the civilization series gives me this opportunity you start as a one of more than 20 civilization with only one city and one warrior and only you can lead it to the prosperity and glory will you play as a warrior and destroy other civilizations or maybe you prefer play as a pacifist will your culture will be interested for other civilization will your people will be the first people in the space you are the leader and you have to choose a correct path for your civilization good lock
recommended
awesome i think tons mor people should play this amazing game
recommended
ive played alot and its fun random maps make it replayable
recommended
i recommend this game to anyone that has interest in controlling their own nation and taking over the world there are also many different ways to win and the multiplayer feature is nice to go against friends multiple ways to win so anyone can enjoy their own play style 
recommended
way too much of a time sink unfortunately military conflicts are pretty much nonexistent  broken in quck games and really only viable in marathon but nobody plays marathon in multiplayer soooooo not to mention multiplayer is buggy as hell i cant tell you how many times ive encountered corrupted saves or units also ai has some pretty stupid glitches that can make them  easy even on the highest difficulties ex ai doesnt know how to fight a war when there is a body of water between you and them ai doesnt know how to fight a war when there are chains of mountains between you and them its actually kind of funny really since on higher difficulties barbarians are more of a threat than other civs youll quickly realize that relations with other civs lack depth and it gets pretty repetitious fast same with the other game once you figure it out its all pretty simple but strangely addicting its really fun to watch your civ grow and nuture it but after a few games it largely apparent the game is a grindfest for technologies basically this game is not hard its just long and gets old quick but yeah its a fun game get it and all the expansions while its on sale youll have a blast for a good number of hours do not recommend full price i honestly cannot recommend you play this with friends unless you have friends with massive amounts of patience and dedication because games can be very very long

this game is surprisingly enjoyable and addictive i recommend buying the complete edition its the best way to play civ 5
recommended
this game is awesome ive only played civ 2 and 3 and this is just so much more avanced and expansive compared to those i really just started and i know that this game will be amazing
recommended
if u havnt heard of the civ series where have u been this turnbased rts game is so hype hours ive spent makin the best empire i can such a great game just one more turn then ill go bed
recommended
pretty good turn based strategy game but playing the game without the expansions feels incomplete
recommended
most addictive game ever
recommended
this is an amazing game one of my favourites actually my friend recommended this game and im normally not into these types of games but i played and i thank him for telling me about this game would get this game without a doubt whilst its on sale 1010
recommended
if only someone were to buy it for me im currently using my friends family sharing to play it and it is funnnnn
recommended
probably the best game that i have on steam right now in my opinion if you dont have it definatly get it you can play the demo before buying also i think the dlcs are also worth it i love this game my opinion
recommended
hitler founded judaism 1010
recommended
extremely addicting im not good enough to win on normal difficulty id rather play on easy and feel like a god as a obliterate all the other civs or build everything beyond every civ the interactions with the others civs has improved previous civilzation games made me feel like a twerp to be bullied by every other civilization either by demanding money and gifts or demanding i go to war with my ally
recommended
ive havent stopped playing and i am playing the game while i type this and i think the rigor mortis
recommended
what can i say civ 5 is my favorite game well at least for now any way i am a big strategy game fan and most civ games suit my expectations about what i look for in a turn based strategy games but civ 5 is the best out of all of them right now in my opinion so far i have 122 hours clocked in on this game and that number will be sure to grow words cant describe how fun it is to start off as an ancient civilization starting out with nothing and slowly grow over time expanding and conquering your foes civ 5 will bring fun to the table for hours now there are issues with the game as in any games like how i think the diplomacy in this game is horrible compared to civ 4 and the location of rescourses and what kind and how much spawns in any one game but the combat system is way better unlike in previous instalments in civ 5 you dont have to go attack with dumb death stacks that actually take away from any kind of militaristic strategies i also noticed that in late game when anti air units come into play they dont always tend to work the civilopidea doesnt give enough info and it lacks some basic tips when hovering the cursor over certain things but these issues are very minor and dont detract from the fun of the game at all like i said ive clocked in countless hours of this game so far and feel i have the right to review the game now and i give it a thumbs up 9 out of 10 if youve never played a civ game and are interested or you just love turn based strategy civ 5 s the best place to start for newbies and vets alike just make sure you buy the complete eddition for the highest extent of fun
recommended
this game is life destroying i love it
recommended
if you like civilization youll like this game if you dont like civilization get the heck out or just play civilization revolutions on diety best in the series
recommended
always have loved civilization series and this is not exception i recommend it
recommended
one of the best games i have ever gotten my hands on ive never played a civilization game or any game of the game type and ended up on a 22 hour spree of oh my god i cant stop this is amazing worth every penny
recommended
this game is absolutely amazing my favorite civ by far while the base game can seem alittle underwhelming gods and kings makes it a civ classic and with brave new world it feels like the culmination of civ games i cant wait to see whats in store for civ 6 as i have already been blown away with how great this game is
recommended
must have this game is for strategy game fans history buffs god game fans war game fans tycoon game fans city building game fans i have bought many games and this is one of my top three i tell all of my friends to buy it and all of my friends who do buy this game love it
recommended
buy this game just do it
recommended
one of the best strategy games out there graphics are quite nice and you really do feel like the master of a nation as you tweak and fine tune your civilization according to your strategy the base game however is a little bland and although it looks much nicer than civ 4 it has been dumbed down overall worth picking up if you want a good game
recommended
first just look at my play time second im a game design student so believe me when i say this is one of the most well designed games and the most well designed strategy game in existence its incredibly easy to get into for beginers but offers enough in depth control for experinced strategy gamers even after thousands of hours and hundreds of games it still holds its place as my go to relaxation game now that i know the perfect formula its still fun to put on a podcast and watch the random generation create an interesting and unique experince look at the other reviews this game makes great stories its jam packed with content and the complete edition regularly goes on sale for 12$ ive been waiting to write this review for awhile but all i can say is this buy it buy the full verison its well worth it if you dont have the cash wait for it to go on sale this is and with infinite replayablity will always remain one of the greatest games of all time
recommended
great game
recommended
i bought it yesterday and i already have 21 hours on it in those hours ive been nuked by ghandi nuked ghandi as poland destroyed korea was involved in two world wars and lead the un best game
recommended
i bought this game thinking the reviews though exaggerated were positive 24 hours later i realized i had to work in the morning took one more turn then another once more then went to work almost fell asleep at work got home more turns perfect distraction on the way to the grave 1010
recommended
this game is extremely awesome especially with the dlc
recommended
its surprisingly good never thought id like a strategy game but civ v really did changed my mind if you are going to buy civ i recommend buying the complete edition
recommended
great game with with great expansions
recommended
the only valid reason for any strategy game lover to not have and love this game is the fear for your life and by that i dont mean dying i just mean having it tick away via seconds and minutes and inevitably hours sunk into this game its addicting but luckily its a sort of benign addiction in that after you finally do wipe the smile from ramallamadingdongs face and crush the siamese army with battleships and b2s you can look upon a world uniformly flying your colors and feel satisfied it might lack some of the finer points of control and systems that games like europa universalis or a couple of previous iterations of civ had but i feel it was a fair trade for how approachable it is civ 5 is extremely easy to learn but difficult to master even after as many hours as ive sunk into it im still learning new strategies and how to deal with challenges and theres no lack of depth here in vanilla civ 5 yes but with the expansions no its a great strategy game to dive into thats unintimidating for the newbies and deep enough for the hardcore
recommended
absolutely wonderful and addictive
recommended
definitely worth your money when it is on sale and even still when not a wide variety of empires to select and each one of them have their own abilities i was playing a match with my friends for over 7 hours its super addicting the games last for a long time and over time you research different abilities like being able to have your units go into the water get on boats and sail along the coast also there is an ability to go into deeper waters to cross the ocean and meet a friend or take over a civilization a really good game to spend your money on
recommended
always have loved civilization series and this is not exception i recommend it
recommended
1010 would nuke again
recommended
talk about a time sink fuuuuuuuuuuck
recommended
if you like strategy games you must buy it
recommended
being indian ive never ever been afraid of gandhi until i played this game 1010

1000010 i love it seriously get this game right now if you havent already edit alright so with now over 250 hours played it is still 1000010 maybe even better now that ive gotten deeper with mods it really is a funsimple strategy game with fun challenges and awesome customization
recommended
i could say so many good things about this game but i am going to keep this fairly short for any strategy lover or anyone new who want to start trying out new strategy games this is the best place to start its addictive lots of dlc generally just an extremely marvelous game 1010 by far
recommended
a wonderful strategy game that you can just lose yourself in for hours
recommended
me and my friend bought this game on sales and i have to say it is a lot of fun but time consuming i know i havent played for that long but i recomend it is awesome and a lot of fun with friends

recommended
a very good stratigy game takes lots of brain power to play multiplayer works like a charm
recommended
civlization v is one of those games that becomes very addicting once you get the swing of things minutes go by like hours and this game [appears to be] somewhat educational so i dont feel as bad for playing this game for hours at a time looks pretty good on directx 11 but will take up a lot of memory on your computer so having nothing else running in the background is recommended
recommended
this game is so addicting too bad i failed a french test for it though
recommended
this game could screw my wife and id be okay with it 1010
recommended
great way to spend a few hours
recommended
so fun i love it addicting i really enjoyed challenging the variety of different players and their mindset
recommended
the only reason i own a pc
recommended
fantastic game i have had so many hours into this game before the expansions even came out
recommended
so ive had a few hours on this game and thought it was time to give my two cents this is a great game and in my opinion it is one of the best strategy games out there there is endless things that you can do in this game you have the ability to create a civ in your own way you can be a waemongler scientific cultured and many more you can shape history how you want to shape history if your in the market looking for strategy games this is by far your best option and hey if you dont like it you have 14days to get a refund after your purchase
recommended
great game reccomend to anybody who finds themselves interested in 4x strategy games able to capture your attention time and time again due to fantastic modding community and great fun to play with friends only downside is that when firaxis updates the game there are some game breaking bugs for a while when playing multiplayer but they generally get ironed out fairly quickly
recommended
if you are a person who has a long attention span then this game is something you would enjoy the games are usally pretty long but full of susspence and choices  with each of your choices leading to peace or war an ally or enemy this is my favorite game on steam and i think everyone would enjoy it as well i give it a raiting of 9  10
recommended
this game is life destroying i love it
recommended
be careful this game can waste your time
recommended
if you like playing chess but need something more colorful you will like this game far from real time war games civilization v is closer to a relaxing game where you have to take decision which will affect the future of your civilization and your ability to fight other empires closer to sim city than age of empire make you choice according to your desires enjoy life

recommended
21 hours in 4 days i think im addicted this game is incredible a must play
recommended
okay ill just make a water mill in my new city and its 5 in the morning already
recommended
i have played a number of civilization games across several platforms but this one takes the cake i keep wanting to play it over and over and over again if you have responsibilities or due dates or anything that is time sensitive i reccomend you to prioritize and make sure you finish real life things first because as soon as you start turn 1 theres no going back sleepless nights have been spent whispering the shadows of my dark room just one more turn 1010
recommended
11 pm playing as austria huge map everybody loves me and i have allot of trade deals so my income is 1000 per turn got around 40k in the bank al city states are my allays what next lets annex all city states with that gold ohgodwhyjpg next turn everybody is denouncing me wtf fast check on my diplomacy everybody got butt hurt because i expanded my empire to fast> 11 30 pm i will just gift some stuff to other nations and hope for the best and then go to bed soddenly i see unhappiness over 60 from annexing all those city states next turn a notification pops out there is an uprising of your citizens in vienna because there are unhappy swipe to my capital and and other city and see 15 enemy units burning everything to the ground midnightneed to go to bed have too go to work at 7 am but first need to resolve that uprising in my capital 6 am citizen are happy and i can finally go to bed turn around from my pc and stared at the window sun shining outside and my alarm goes off time to wake up fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu happened 10 time so far 1010 would do again great game really fast so you lose track of time if you have a life and familly never say just one more turn
recommended
hitler founded judaism 1010
recommended
this game is perfect if you have hours to kill because it is easy to get lost in it a very rewarding game and the mods for it are amazing
recommended
the complete version is just amazing
recommended
its awesome
recommended
this game provides literally hundreds of hours or more of fun the randomness of the maps the large amount of civilizations the multiple different ways to victory and the many ways to achieve that makes this game so unique that its impossible for it to feel repetitive this is well worth the cost and definitely a game to get now if youll excuse me i have to get back to playing
recommended
civ 5 took a while to grow on me on its first release i was not impressed the expansion packs have really added a lot though and i think with time i also got over the differences as compared to civ 4 im really torn on the gameiness of civ 5 though like i still feel like the social policy trees and the citystates dont naturally fit theyre fun because youre leveling up and questing but the policy system of civ 4 seemed like it made more sense from a simulation point of view and gave you some cool flexibility when your needs changed and the city state quests quickly become stupid and again feel more like gimmicky game elements rather than a part of history but again the policies are rewarding and the revamped cultural victory introduced in brave new world moves them from gimmicks supporting a weird win condition to fun ways to customize your game i could still do without the city states though i agree that the diplomatic victory from previous games was poorly done and i appreciate that city states do fix this but it seems like a poorer fix than might have been hoped on a sidenote id be curious to play vanilla civ 5 and see if it still feels weak compared to vanilla civ 4 or if my resistance to civ 5 really was just eew hexes and nonstacked units  weird either way i have since come to really enjoy civ 5 especially with brave new world i look forward to civ 6 whatever shape it may take unless its online only thank god civ isnt owned by ea
recommended
this game sucks so bad i never even bothered to download it 1410
recommended
extremely addicting im not good enough to win on normal difficulty id rather play on easy and feel like a god as a obliterate all the other civs or build everything beyond every civ the interactions with the others civs has improved previous civilzation games made me feel like a twerp to be bullied by every other civilization either by demanding money and gifts or demanding i go to war with my ally
recommended
ive havent stopped playing and i am playing the game while i type this and i think the rigor mortis
recommended
i cant believe how good and addicting this game is i tried to play freeciv in the past and never got how people could think that was addicting but civ v solved my main issue with it theres too much to handle but civ v forces me to handle everything before ending my turn and gosh im playing with d pedro ii
recommended
civ 5 is a really fun turn based strategy game great to play with friends
recommended
one of the best games in the history  the only tip that i can give to new players is  never trust ghandi
recommended
its civ v so its dope
recommended
honestly i dont know how this takes so much of my time only wish multiplayer was less glitchy and had most of the same features as it does in singleplayer will continue playing hours of this game
recommended
fantastic game like you should buy it just because i say so
recommended
best move i made on steam buying this game really worth the money especially in the steam sale
recommended
1010 would civ again
recommended
probably the best game that i have on steam right now in my opinion if you dont have it definatly get it you can play the demo before buying also i think the dlcs are also worth it i love this game my opinion
recommended
i need help
recommended
i really like this
recommended
best strategy game ive ever played
recommended
this game is great
recommended
if only someone were to buy it for me im currently using my friends family sharing to play it and it is funnnnn
recommended
an excellent strategy game fun playing and challenging play as some of the historical nations that are in the game or get mods from the workshop and play some other nation that you would like to play as you can also play with your friends both multiplayer and hot seat play this game  super fun play with friends  double the fun
recommended
this is a great game and has good multiplayer
recommended
its nice
recommended
there are whole novels im never going to have the time to write because of this damn game 2010
recommended
having never palyed a civilization game before this was quite a foreign concept i had watched my friend play it a little bit and understood the basics from general knowledge either way i bought it on a sale and dont regret it played my first game went total warmonger and fought the world and won pros easy to understand complex for veterans workshop unique ai each posing their own unique threat cons ai is as thick as bricks multiplayer is apalling far less features than single player and frequent and extremely irritating bugs and connectivity issuesunrelated to the client not being updated frequently and any update is usually a bugfix of some sort ridiculously expensive the dlc is pretty much a requirement to enjoy the game fully and said dlc is very expensive overall an absolutely brilliant game however it is too expensive if you have been turned off by the price i understand currently if you choose to buy all the dlc individually if would cost you 136 euros however a full edition is available for 45 this number is too big if you wait for a sale you can pick up the complete edition for 15 euros a puurchase you will not regret
recommended
with all the dlc its a very good game dont try it without them though ah thats it others write proper ones
recommended
plays this game 5 minutes later why is it 4 am but seriously this is a good epic game but if your computer sucks i advise you not to get it cause the graphics are too good
recommended
just wish you could retaliate to the npcs instead of just taking their insults
recommended
meh  i dont feel like writing long & detailed review  the game is great  graphics are pretty good and satisfying for a turn based game  actually this is the best turn based game ive ever played so far  and i played most of them  you should definitely give a try  1010 worth every penny
recommended
having played previous civilization games i found this one to be extremely satisfying not only can cities defend themselves without a unit inside which was problematic in some earlier civs but the dlc for this game is actually worth the price the faith the spies the tourism such small tweaks turn a good game into an amazing one
recommended
ive been a civilization player since i was four or five years old i can remember sitting next to my dad as a very small child and building leonardos workshop and the great library my brother won the entire first grade a reward when he was seven because he knew from playing civilization that the capital of the aztec empire was tenochtitlan and he told the principal of his school at an assembly due to my heavy nostalgia about the civilization franchise i want every new incarnation of the game to be absolutely spectacular i want them to loyally follow the topdown turnbased strategy model i know and love but add to it with the graphics computing and complexity that our modern technology can bring usually im disappointed because many games in the franchise complicate the original formula too much by allowing infinite units scattered everywhere and too many resources to play with in my mind civilization v is the first sequel in the series that really is perfect and brave new world dlc package adds some polish and new mechanics that will enhance the already spectacular experience i have played 45 hours of this game in the last three weeks because it is so addicting the thing that makes civilization v so spectacular is that every game is different and every decision matters so that when you start up a map you are in an entirely different situation which you can conquer only through extremely precise management the original civilization v is a great addition to the series because it isnt complicated it doesnt take long to learn but after a few games youll be markedly better for knowing some nuances of strategy brave new world also seems to offer this at face value the trade routes policy and culture changes the dlc adds are fairly minor and easy to learn but after fooling with them for a while ive found they are huge advantages when used correctly a wellplaced caravan can now save a floundering city the policies in the game are much more desirable than they were in civilization v sans brave new world so you now have to rework old strategies to put more emphasis on culture art and writing make culture victories way more interesting overall the dlc adds a lot of complexity without making gameplay more complicated in singleplayer games you will have more things to think about if you want to play the higher levels where the dlc really shines though is in multiplayer matches the ai is fun to trade paintings and resources with but they are extremely predictable your friends family and even strangers will make deals the ai never would that will help you win more spectacularly than ever before caravans and cargo boats are new with brave new world and they will let you play much more skillfully with players than you could without it i havent figured everything out yet and i expect it will take me a few hundred hours and maybe a bit of slogging through the civilopedia to do so but i highly recommend downloading brave new world even if you are slower than i am to get the nuance its fun to play with friends even if you are only defending against onslaughts of infantry and bombers with your warriors and cavalry a demo is available right now on the steam store
recommended
unlike the previous versions units are not stackable in the same tile 
recommended
amazing experience worth the money even now i started playing civilization games at civrev but this took it to a whole new level even with the release of beyond earth i still come back to whoop my friends and the ai in civ 5
recommended
took 10 mins to find out how to go to the next turn 1110 would next turn again
recommended
even though some features from the previous civ games didnt make it into this one the huge new improvements such as city states hexagon tiles and having only one unit per tile more than make up for it making this the best civ game so far
recommended
you know that feeling when you play sims and youre in the building mode that x100
recommended
it was a peaceful world until i meet gandy
recommended
i think best turnbased strategy game everonce you play you cant quit anymore 
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
a nice evolution of the classic civ games if a bit simplified maybe expansion packs will fill in the gaps as they did with previous versions but i wont be finding out as it will take a lot of persuasion for me to buy another civ game my problem single player is reliable but multiplayer is atrocious nearly two years after release its just about possible to get a 4player game going but gameplay is laggy regardless of connection speeds involved and as soon as a problem occurs it can take hours to get the game going again from saves if its not a total loss all firaxis2k seem interested in is churning out countless dlc as more keeps appearing even though the base game still isnt working properly such a shame edit after a couple of years and as many expansions this game now has a lot more depth the multiplayer issues are gone and my ire has subsided i can wholeheartedly recommend this as a successor to the previous games and its worth picking up the full edition when theres a sale on will i be buying the sequelspinoff beyond earth then yes but not until the full edition is in the sale because by then i can expect any bugs to have been resolved and the game to be filled out to its proper potential
recommended
very fun if you like strategy games cpus can be a pain because they refuse to make fair trades it can be a little confusing at first but once you get the hang of it you cant stop playing you can have a lot more fun if you have a friend to play it with
recommended
ye pretty good aye
recommended
fun game tht can last for hours great for when nothings going on and you want to have some fun either alone or with friends
recommended
of the 443 hours that ive played this game in the last two weeks 443 of them were over the course of the past two days i think that says something about the quality of this game or just my mental condition whatever you should get it trust me on this
recommended
ok ive had this game for a few years now and i think that its about time that i give it a review disclaimer i do have all the dlc so many things i decribe may not apply to the standard edition first the pros  insane replayablilty ive been playing this game for 3 years now  is still a plenty worthy game despite civilization beyond earth  loads of different civilizations and styles of maps to play on  graphics are still very enjoyable  it is really really addictiing cons  public multiplayer blows if you expect to want to play multiplayer your going to want a private server with some friends  it can crash not to often but save your game  can seem a bit dumbeddown at times  ai is a bit dull this is a fantastic game and it is well worth the price go for the complete edition though the dlcs are very nice to have it is simplistic enough for beginneers and has a pretty shallow learning curve but has the ability for depth and micromanagement if that is more your thing it has great replayability cant say this enough and especially if you have some friends to play with its a blast
recommended
very enjoyable and addicting game i reccomend buying more than 1 copy for you and your friends to play
recommended
you die a hero or you live long enough to become a villain

a strategy game that you will love if you like turnbased games just be aware of extremely slow end turn time after a few hours into your game if you have a slow computer
recommended
found gandhi nuked gandhi gandhi sent 10 nukes to my cities i sent 11 to his war won 1010 would nuke gandhi again
recommended
this game is absolutely fantastic get it during a sale though as its a bit expensive and make sure to get the complete edition the vanilla game is quite broken in certain aspects great game to play with friends too
recommended
would you be interested in a trade agreement with steam for this game
recommended
this game is the best game ever made
recommended
its the best out there
recommended
great game
recommended
an extremely well made strategy game its great on its own but also amazing with expansions play it alone or with friends its your choice highly recommended
recommended

one of those games that you say youll stop playing this at 1 in the morning all of a sudden its 9 in the morning and youve just missed your first class this game has it all gameplay is top notch graphics are wonderful the added languages of other leaders is a nice touch and you may even learn a little something about history along the way easily the best strategy game thats out there
recommended

recommended
great game so addicting to play
recommended
world domination is the best domination conquer at will and send all the hippies to hell
recommended
i bought the complete edition when it was on sale for $12 and until now it has been amazing i love the fact that the game is paced according to you and no one yells at you for not keeping your crosshair at head level like csgo  no one cares if you research killing robots or mathmateics no one cares if you decide to skip your turns without doing anything get this game while its on sale get it after the sale is over get it now worth every cent
recommended
when civ 5 came out i didnt like it at all i still wouldnt like it if not for the exceptional expansions that address pretty much every flaw except the ai which i still find a bit silly but i find almost all ai flawed its friendly and fair to the new civ players and has enough content to keep the veterans occupied i especially loved the scenarios
recommended
this game is a really good game there are a few people that hate on it but as you can see the reviews are overwhelmingly positive the graphics arent bad at all you can see the soldier units move and attack each other you can see the workers making whatever youre improving and you can even see the wonder buildings inside of your city very cool i really like how this was made the only thing i have a problem with is that in lategame it gets really laggy but thats probably because im on a 5 year old mac laptop but it still runs really well early game and i really like it i feel like the money i paid for civilization 5 was well spent because i can get a lot of hours of playing from this game there are many different things you can do paths you can take and things you can build every game is different which is why i really like this game id reccomend this game 1110
recommended
one of my all time favorite sid meiers civilization give you the perfect opportunity to play through the ages as one of you favorite countries and with steam workshope you can customize it as you like big thumbs up
recommended
an excellent singleplayer and multiplayer game that needs the dlc to be top notch the great thing is the sheer variety of game modes leaders scenarios maps victory conditions etc that mean you never play the game twice the multiplayer element can sometimes still be a little buggy and if someones joining or leaving a game it may lag out for a bit but otherwise it is a truly excellent game that i would recommend fully just a great game
recommended
i dont know why i can review this game i dont even have it im 10 and what is this help
recommended
civ 5 is proper mint love it
recommended
genius smoother than civ 4
recommended
really good and stuff
recommended

recommended

fantastic game and with so much content in terms of playable nations maps and sizes etc especially with both expansion packs added it still has lots of replay value even after being played for over 100 hours already as no 2 matches are the same

ive been a fan of the civ series since the very first one came out and i think this one follows quite well in the footsteps of its predecessors and also makes some nice if not necessary changes that make it stand on its own it took a little getting used to because ive been playing civ 4 for a very long time and i had become accustomed to that setup the civ 5 setup keeps many of the same commands the same but there are some other smaller differences that may take a few turns to really get the hang of one thing that im not a huge fan of is the lack of the ability to stack military units as in the older civs especially to garrisson a city but its a relative issue and it just makes you plan a bit more carefully overall a very good game with sharp graphics good sound and solid ai

time you need time to play this so far am into approx 13 hours on a single vs ai game and i can never get enough i guess what i like most about this is its not like most strategy games where the ai mechanics eventually just give up and stop doing anything productive at the endgame they will constantly produce content for you to enjoy for hours on end also not to mention workshop integration for community made historical battles and events to scale maps of earths countries and continents if you are a turn based strategy fan or not i wasnt this is a franchise you must try
recommended
oh my god must i really ok ok civ 5 is one of my most favorite games and i always enjoy playing it no matter which leader i play as or what type of world i play in i absolutely adore the graphics and the game mechanics which makes me unable to wait to play civ beyond earth the only issue i have is how long it takes to produce something with new cities i highly recommend everybody to play this game so civ 5 gets the extremely rare 1010

a nice game for hours of fun and challeging campaigns you can play as a bunch of civilizationsleader each leadercivilizations has a special abillity buildings units the game has a lot of maptypes so never know how its going to look if you think the game is to hardeasy try changing the difficulty to a lowerhigher level the game also has a couple of scenarios you can play a lot of mods to try out great multiplayer to play with your friends or strangers if you think the game is to longquik you can change the gamepace to very short games or very long games if you want a game that you can play for hours dont look futher you found it

great game epic single player and great multiplayer suitible for all ages but may only be fun for 8 you can play it over and over again and never get bored
recommended
it kills me to think about the cumulative human time spent playing this game
recommended
most addictive game ever

pro great turnbased strategy timeline evolution very easy to learn endless replayability awesome singleplayer good graphics for its genre calming soundtrack many different game setups fun city management lots to build upgrade and research game gives suggestions on what to build upgrade or research decent diplomaticy system action > reaction for example expand your territory near other civilizations > they might get angry > they might denounce you > other civilizations might distrust you > every civilization turns against you > nukes > new game steam workshop con diplomacy system is not perfect for example when demanding another civilization to stop spying on you most of the time or atleast when they dislike you they tell you that theyre trying to steal research to keep their people safe from you whatever the outcome of that conversation about 1 turn later that civilization contacts you again to tell you that they are sorry you can then tell them that you forgive them or not but whatever you choose they will always try to spy on you again later on even if you have a much bigger army than them it seems that they dont care about risking a war announcement from your side loading time of startingloading a game takes a bit too long verdict even though i expected more from the diplomacy system this is still the best and easiest to learn turnbased strategy game i have ever played dlc are a must have to enjoy it to the fullest keeps you hooked for many many hours 910 what to buy i highly recommend getting the full game package the dlc are a must for the full experience even with workshop possibilities ps most players find civ 5 a better game than the latest civ beyond earth i feel the same way about this beyond earth is far from a bad game but it just doesnt keep me hooked the way civ 5 does the fact that civ 5 can be played with all its dlc and that beyond earth has no big dlc out yet probably plays a big part in it overal be feels incomplete civ 5 has also aged very well it doesnt look dated at all compared to the latest installment
recommended
this is an amazing game one of my favourites actually my friend recommended this game and im normally not into these types of games but i played and i thank him for telling me about this game would get this game without a doubt whilst its on sale 1010

this fabulous example of turn based strategy senir meiers capitalisation v is a game about open borders research agreements and unhappiness among the general populus this game has grown on me and i believe that the price of it is 100% fair and is also worth every monies overall i would give this game a carrot out of rice patty and allow it to continue charging modest and fair prices
recommended
this is one of the best games i have ever played it is surely worth the money if you are considering between this and say call of duty buy this it is 100x better and is a lot more fun to lay it is a game that will not get boring so much variety in the game you could choose between about 45 different nations and try to win in different ways all in all i highly recommend this game to people who looked to have fun playing by themselves or with a group of friends
recommended
ladies and gentlemen i give you one of my favorite games of all time this is sid meiers civilization v a little background with this game i was never a big fan of the series prior to this game the only other civilization id played up until this point was with civilization revolution which i enjoyed playing but unfortunately had some flaws that i could easily point out here though its a much different story this game not only changed my view of civilization but that of strategy games steam and even pc gaming as a whole this game had a certain appeal to me as i was a fan of learning or nations history culture and warfare this game has many of histories greatest civilizations and leaders and has even a small sinopsis of their histories and culture if you want to poke around a little and learn but who cares about that i wanna play a game not learn stupid history well its no slacker in that department either each civilization has its own unique units buildings and buffs that affect their playstyle and you can play a variety of ways to win conquer the world with a domination victory become a cultural utopia the first men in space be the master diplomat it rolls anyway the game holds my official favorite video soundtrack ever yes i said it it works much different than other soundtracks when youll be playing for hours unknown to you of course its bound to get old actually no it has that right amount of intensity calmness and grandeur to make it really memorable without even trying my only complaint with it is that the ai has its idiotic moments but i was having too much fun to care and its far from easy but not unacessable to newcomers maybe its not for everyone but it deserves to be tried for its amazing take on turn based strategy and even elements i havent mentioned like it supporting mods and its amazing dlc that isnt a lazy tack on or the scenarios if you get bored of regular games go out and try it yourself but for me it ranks easily into my top 3 favorite video games of all time

this game is a really good game there are a few people that hate on it but as you can see the reviews are overwhelmingly positive the graphics arent bad at all you can see the soldier units move and attack each other you can see the workers making whatever youre improving and you can even see the wonder buildings inside of your city very cool i really like how this was made the only thing i have a problem with is that in lategame it gets really laggy but thats probably because im on a 5 year old mac laptop but it still runs really well early game and i really like it i feel like the money i paid for civilization 5 was well spent because i can get a lot of hours of playing from this game there are many different things you can do paths you can take and things you can build every game is different which is why i really like this game id reccomend this game 1110
recommended
obviously by the look of my total hours played you can say that i enjoy this game very much its not entirely the main game that i enjoy the most but the mods for this game are incredible given they arent nothing like civ 4s fall from heaven 2 but there are some incredible mods out there for civ 5 this game completely engulfs you into a land of which youre familiar with or into a whole new style of landscape where you can explore plan out your next cities and watch them grow and when one of your neighboring civs  you off well war it is this game pretty much has everything youd want in a turn based strategy game and id easily recommend this to anyone and everyone that hasnt already played this masterpiece 1010
recommended
this is one of the best classic strategy games ever though without dlc is kind of bland if you plan on getting the game dlc is a must because the game without gak and bnw is a long game with and repeating process and its cheaper to get the game and all dlcs then them seperate i fell victim to this hopefully you wont do the same
recommended
the game is realy interesting but you need to pay a lot for dlc
recommended
when civ 5 came out i didnt like it at all i still wouldnt like it if not for the exceptional expansions that address pretty much every flaw except the ai which i still find a bit silly but i find almost all ai flawed its friendly and fair to the new civ players and has enough content to keep the veterans occupied i especially loved the scenarios
recommended
very nice game 
recommended
i only recommended for fear of ghandi
recommended
it is so satisfying to just roflstomp your most hated civilization and they will admit that they are inferior compared to your master race oo

one of the best strategy games out there graphics are quite nice and you really do feel like the master of a nation as you tweak and fine tune your civilization according to your strategy the base game however is a little bland and although it looks much nicer than civ 4 it has been dumbed down overall worth picking up if you want a good game

a nice evolution of the classic civ games if a bit simplified maybe expansion packs will fill in the gaps as they did with previous versions but i wont be finding out as it will take a lot of persuasion for me to buy another civ game my problem single player is reliable but multiplayer is atrocious nearly two years after release its just about possible to get a 4player game going but gameplay is laggy regardless of connection speeds involved and as soon as a problem occurs it can take hours to get the game going again from saves if its not a total loss all firaxis2k seem interested in is churning out countless dlc as more keeps appearing even though the base game still isnt working properly such a shame edit after a couple of years and as many expansions this game now has a lot more depth the multiplayer issues are gone and my ire has subsided i can wholeheartedly recommend this as a successor to the previous games and its worth picking up the full edition when theres a sale on will i be buying the sequelspinoff beyond earth then yes but not until the full edition is in the sale because by then i can expect any bugs to have been resolved and the game to be filled out to its proper potential
recommended
buy this

first game had no idea what i was doing got rekt by ghengis and atilla by turn 100 1010 would take the warlord d3k again

recommended
the best strategy game i have ever played 1010
recommended
this game overall is a great strategy based game thats fun to play with friends or alone
recommended
an awsome game that every strategist has to play 
recommended
civilization is a fantastic game that i absolutely cant get enough of real time strategy games can become overwhelming at some point which is one reason why i love civilization 5 so much since its turned based the combat system is great lots of technologys to research tons of units to use to crush your enemies diplomacy in singleplayer can get a bit annoying because the ai is so territorial but in multiplayer you can effectively use diplomacy to crush your foes and bring yourself to the top the spy system is both a asset and a disability its a asset since you can get free technologys or convert a citystate to become your ally however it can be a disability since players can see when you steal a technology and most often demand for the removal of your spy and a lot of times the spy fails to get a new technology and gets killed in the process naval combat is insanely fun from trireme rushing your neighbors to a long range naval invasion using battleships and aircraft carriers i would recommend this game to anyone who is a huge fan of strategy turn based games
recommended
eunan hates this game therefore buy it

sid meiers civilization v is the first game i received on steam and although i dont remember most of it i have just under 300 hours on it as of writing this the reason that i do not remember it is not because it is an unmemorable game but that i dont remember playing it for that long i am almost 80% sure i have just played this game for a week straight and didnt notice it that is how addictive this game is if you are a fan of any rts style game this will be right at home with you with tons of civilizations to play as all with unique bonuses and troops that make the game feel incredibly surreal i usually do not talk about the soundtrack of a game but this game has by far one of the best sound tracks i have ever heard and a quick search through the game files gives you access to all of the music even though i would easily pay to have it the gameplay is excellent the soundtrack good enough to talk about and the openness of it gets this game a 910 i would play for 300 more hours
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is one of the best games i have ever played

i dont know why i can review this game i dont even have it im 10 and what is this help
recommended
an excellent singleplayer and multiplayer game that needs the dlc to be top notch the great thing is the sheer variety of game modes leaders scenarios maps victory conditions etc that mean you never play the game twice the multiplayer element can sometimes still be a little buggy and if someones joining or leaving a game it may lag out for a bit but otherwise it is a truly excellent game that i would recommend fully just a great game
recommended
its awesome and fun to play d
recommended
playing this game a thing i would do is invade a neighboring country and force my own ideology on them even if they didnt want it
recommended
played on the earth map ended up with two safe cities free of radiation poisoning 1010 would annihilate humanity again
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is an excellent game im both an avid gamer and a history buff and civ does a great job of catering to those two aspects of my personality i mean who doesnt want to see the aztecs develop nuclear weapons and annihilate the europeans who conquered them im not a fan of turn based games but civ just keeps me coming back one more turn turns into two more turns which turns into three hours of my life spent trying to stop playing the game it is addicting i recommend civ to any strategy fans
recommended
 bought the game last night  ignored the addictive warnings  started the game  game crash with every video found out i screwed up the installation  installated it again  game works fine after a few test rounds starts a serious game  9 hours later being the biggest  on the map surrounding every other nation  got something to drink and eat to enjoy a world war  computer crashes due to the heat of my room  didnt save the game  got into rage mode 1010 that i will do it all over again
recommended
one of my favorite civilization games and near the top of my list of favorite rts games of all time only star craft being number 1 and command and conquer tiberium series being number 2 i dont consider my self one of the best player as i cant beat the ai on the hardest settings especially if gandhi is dominating the map

recommended
okay tis the big one civilization v my favourite game besides team fortress 2 i cant decide which one i like more they are so different to play to enjoy ect but i can say you this buy the dlcs not only gods & kings and brave new world but also the dlcs adding new civilizations like spain the inka denmark korea babylon if you wanna try out this game wait for a sale this turnbased strategy game isnt a game for everybody so when the sale comes when this game is on sale its nearly always 75% on the game and every dlc buy this game including gods & kings and brave new world i just love this game and i know many people who do aswell 
recommended
very fun game reminds me of age of empires i would like to see the persian immortals look a little like they did back in the day the game is perfect i love the scenarios and everything about it i would love to see a siege weapon that could fire from 3 tiles away before the artillery it would be much easier to lay siege to a city 5 stars
recommended
this is such an amazing game
recommended
this is a game you can real lose track of time playing lol youll spend hours on it before you know it
recommended
now this is a fringe game for me i love it but the hate is just as strong pros very good looking once you get it very easy menus nice variety cons repetitive as hell be prepared for hour after hour doing nothing music isnt great can wear on your nerves  ai but mods help no actual tutorial very same gameplay no earthchanging elements remember  ai yeah almost always war all in all 610
recommended
its ok
recommended
we all know this is a good game unmatched and unrivaled this game is unique and runs well
recommended
one of the best civilization games out at this time i am recommend to my friends all the time 1010
recommended
one of the best games in the category of strategy you make all decisions on how to win the game with or without suggestive help you can make your own history of the world and the ai are completely unlike what the should be but i would still conquer the anyways ghandi wants to spread the peace nukes  peace greece always attacks you and sucks at defending while england is terrible at being an empire my only complaint is that when the ai difficulty increase pretty much only there bonuses increase but there intelligence is too artificial to be any more of a dumbass when it comes to military strats
recommended
only ever completed one full match but is rlly fun if you have time to actually play like quit your day job to play this game it takes so long

amazing game when you have all the expansions you can play without but the game feels a incomplete if you do the game is at its best when you play multiplayer with people who will stick around until the end so if you dont have any friends who play then check the community you wont regret it 
recommended
a game with countless hours worth of fun 1010
recommended
i highly recommend this civilization v game i have been playing the series since the beginning since 1st civ in the early 1990s and this is the most challenging game of the series on many fronts especially strategy and tactics if you like strategy type games where you have to think ahead this is your type of game and not get your butt kicked by your enemies and other players at the same time the graphics are amazing especially in closeup and making money vs losing money is difficult depending on your level of play as well as keeping your citizens happy is also a brain teaser it is so replayable and the mods are killer lots of good talent out there in cyberland bringing in good mods but most of all  have fun
recommended
one of my favorite strategy games of all time

civilization v is one of the best pc games i can suggest to anyone who asks its a massive time consumer but its deffinetly worth it i personly own all the dlcs which t received after purchasing the complete edition and it just creates a whole new gaming experience so buy this gamei urge you you will not regret it 5s 1010
recommended
if youre a civilization fan then youll love this if your not then its a game about starting out as cavemen and guide your tribe too world domination advancing through the ages too the modern times its a great game and totally addictive but it does reach the point of being repetitive and with its top down view dont expect to feel too involved in the world apart from your first city the rest will just be zones of influence nothing to get upset about if you lose just annoyed and determined to get back under your control still hours of game play can be lost playing this shame they didnt get leonard nimoy back for the narration again though

i think this game is absolutely wonderful in my first week of owning it i played 81 hours however i would highly recommend the complete edition the base game is lacking in some crucial aspects and has a greatly deminished roster of civs to play as

play it before going to bed for a couple minute and then realize it was 5 in the morning

civilization v is not as advanced as titles such as europa universalis and such what it is  though is perhaps the most accesible grand strategy games on the marketit has tutorials that will ease you into the game quickly and it manages to be understandable and extremely fun for even people new to the series the game allows you to play the game how you want you can make a game short or long depending on the amount of time you want to sink in and youll want to sink in even though i said it is dumbed down compared to paradox interactive titles there is still a hell of a lot to do  not even counting the two massive expansions although i think the game does feel less engaging without the expansions so id highly recommend getting them the inclusion of the steam workshop is a nice touch  but not especially new since civ games since 2  have always had the option of user created content when you dive into the game  after picking a map  a civ 43 with all dlc  and a speed there are also advanced options which allow you to tweak game settings and spice up the experience like a onecity challenge youll experience the building of your empire from 4000bc to the future youll declare war on other civs or you might engage in trading  or maybe youll enact a research agreement so you can unlock rifling or whatever else with the two expansions added a whole new element of diversity is added as you spread religion and tourism spy on your enemies and friends  ultilitize trade caravans vote on world issues and advancements in the world congress  and pick your civilizations ideology  each expansion gameplay system grants benefits to the player and deeply increases the fun of the early and middlelate game periods city statessmall civs in short are included in vanilla and expanded upon in the expansions which allow you to use them for your economic militaristic or cultural benefit honestly  there is so much to do  i could go on for days do note that the ai and diplomacy is severely better in the expansions so i would defintely recommend them too multiplayer is apparently good too  although i havent played much of that civ 5 is hard to sum up in one word i could write ten articles  but ill have to settle with fantastic

civilization 5 is by far the best game in the civilization series and the best game ever made by sid meier with a perfect mix of historical and classical civilizations with various famous monarchs and the perfected advance rts gameplay with the ability to conquer any civilization if you have the skill of course which louis doesnt lol delve into the ancient era which advances every turn and travel through time in this amazing game all the way to the modern era with nukes and xcom soldiers this game is the perfect mix of historyrts and is amazing in multiplayer but dont ever play against sam beware you will get owned i highly recommend this game and is highly worth the price
recommended
a very deep and complex game itll take you at least 100 hours just to learn all the civs and you never stop playing its even more fun with friends

hello firaxis games have really made an amazing game here yes the base nonexpanded game wasnt all that great but it had the capacity to be awesome which with the expansions it did indeed become one of the greatest turn based strategy games out there art is great the tiles and units are stunningly good and the overlay hud fits just right with everything else mechanics are perfect with the complete game expansions and when you have a few friends handy it makes for hours and hours of enjoyment laughing at how radioactive ghandi is planning wars against that one allpowerful nemesis of yours choosing religions and then proceeding to annoy the heck out of the other religious nations in the game by converting their cities its got everything needed for its genre folks thats why its my most played game in my library price for the base game should drop 5 or so dollars maybe the expansions as well and the maps could be another dollar less but the complete edition is almost a steal that could go up to a 60 and still be good a great recommendation for both casual and competitive the game will keep you occupied for a long time a warning though you must buy the complete edition to really experience the greatness of the game the base game feels incomplete without the expansions wolfy
recommended
this game ruined my life its the only thing i ever do i have no friends now 1010

excellent game from sid meier civilization v has alot of addons you can get the random generator never gets old

the premier multiplayer simultaneous turn based game out there rich in variety and options late game is the only weakness as games may bog down however the game is still fantastic

extremely fun strategy game allows you to take control of a civilization and better the world or raise hell in it the game is good without the expansion packs but with them the game becomes a masterpiece every move counts and you have to really think about what you do far in advance the game itself isnt very user friendly so if you plan to buy it watch a tutorial here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvf_yeozektja also the game is much better with friends a must buy for strategy gamers 910 hope this helps and have fun with the game

civ good as ever i played civ iv a lot it is still fun etc i dont plan to make a huge review this time i just say i wish you would be able to hear the language of the countries like in civ iv short review if u like strategy games and a huuuuuuge choice of countries thats the right game you can see how your land your cities are expanding and you are getting mightier after time and how your country develops really great to play it takes some time to get in the gameplay but i would definately recommend it
recommended
this game is amazing highly recomend it
recommended
i want it
recommended
just one more turn
recommended
this a great stragic game that is less stressful than most games
recommended
a great game that combines strategy and history to form one of the most exciting games i have experienced the replay value is very high as you will never get the same experience out of sid meiers civilization v twice whether youre playing a solo game or a domination match against a handful of friends you will not regret purchasing this game that being said i feel obligated to give a small disclaimer even if you devote your life and soul to this strategic masterpiece you will not always win especially in multiplayer you will have times where barbarians are relentlessly attacking your capital until your scientific utopia turns into detroit with legalized meth you will have times where you decide to pick a new civ and realize that the civ you chose is utterly repugnant you will have times where you are trying your hardest to keep your citizens from starving rebelling being unhappy being enslavedcaptured up until some warmongering brickhouse beats the living daylight out of you and you watch as everything you have spent the last three days building gets completely rekt i have now around 250 hours on civilization v and to this day i have never won a multiplayer match against my friends theyre much better than i am at this game lol and ghandi still nukes my cities while i flee in terror but i love the feeling of having an army at my command having multiple options to win a game having the choice to form alliances or betrayals and watching your village grow into a oversized metropolis with giant death robots and nuclear missiles civ v has an array of difficulties for different play styles and one of them is sure to suit you almost every time i play this game multiplayer  i end up getting completely and utterly destroyed but i would not trade it for the world pros giant death robots multiple victories many different civilizations to play nearseamless multiplayer destroying enemy cities naming your cities hilarious things researching techs in your order overall exciting experiences variation of difficulties cons ghandi is the ultimate war machine and he will not stop until your empire has been reduced the ash and a handful of starving citizens suffering from radiation and burns if you see ghandi in your civ game its time to wave the white flag haha 1110 would recommend

just one more turn

look man im not gonna take a lot of time explaining this game i only need to say if you like rts or any game that you control a civilization you gonna like civilization v just dont think that its like age of empires its not but its also good in its own way in civilization you can destroy the romans as the egypt its awesome and one last thing dont think that you have many historical option like europa universalis iv but its also pretty good

one of if not the best game i have ever played if you enjoy strategic game play with many many decisions i highly recommend this game for you while there have been a few bugs and some still persist fireaxis is doing a good job working those out in the meantime enjoy this awesome game
recommended
this game is the kind of game i love most a game with a rich singleplayer experience with loads of charm and beauty as well as the concept of rewriting history with faces you might ot might not recognize the game also includes a multiplayer while a bit buggy at times leads to constant war and laughs along the way this game also creates stories stories of your own that you create such as chasing the russians and burining every city they placed across the world or enjoying mods such as the glorious pc master race or playing the nation of your heritage i would recommend this to anyone that likes grand strategy and to anyone in general can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time
recommended
best civ yet
recommended
i should have written a review sooner i have had this game almost some years now and is the 1st game i purchased on my account i give it to you at the time i spent most of my chore money and my money for candies in order to buy this game and i couldnt have chosen a greater game to start off steam with this game was technically the only reason why i keep this account alive p
recommended
great game
recommended
fun and addictive every time i go to play this game for a few minutes it turns into an 8 hour play session i thouroughly enjoy this game
recommended
if you have a big group of steam friends that want to play multiplayer this is the game its a turnbased build your empire game there are a variaty of map sizes gamemodes and victory types its entirely beneficial to buy the compleate pack dlc because it makes for a way better experience
recommended
definetly worth the buy i played it addictively when i first got it and i have never seemed to get tired of it i will start playing and just cannot stop the brave new world dlc is also definetely worth it and playing with friends makes the game even better i would recomment buying the dlc on sale though the dlcs add so much more to the game
recommended
have a full day open when you start hard to step away
recommended
this game is absolutely amazing graphics gameplay personalities of ai and people insulting your armies but before you buy it just check how many hours people have and see if you are really ready to delve that deep into civ vtheres no turning back > mwahahaha just kidding great game and definetly get it great job developers 
recommended
why should you buy this well theres 2 different things that get a lot of people hooked up 1 you can make your own religion spread it to other civilization you customize the religon yourself name etc 2 if you like strategy games with nuclear bombs then this is a game for you if you buy the brave new world pack you wont regret it as it as a lot of cool stuff in it such as trade with cargo ships or carvanas world congress everyone gets a vote and youll decide what things you should vote on i recommend buying the complete pack its totally worth it this game gets a 1010 from me
recommended

recommended
simple and fun but can be quite challenging

great game rich with content and time consuming but worth every hour of game experience warning only for patient ones
recommended
very awesome game great graphics i cant wait to try civ 5 beyond earth d
recommended
im not even good at games like civ but civ v has me coming back to it again and again because its just plain fun ive lost hours upon hours building empires and theyve just flown by one of the most engrossing games you can buy on steam but you probably already knew that it is civ after all
recommended
so addictive its almost a bad thing almost
recommended
man what an awesome time waster this game is civilization is one game that will always have a place in my heart but honesetly nothing has changed dramatically from 1 to this apart from things like 1 unit per tile and hexagonal tiles you still explore settle battle research strike flaky treaties only to have them broken when you refuse stupid demands get into century long military stalemates etc  its like the malibu stacy with a new dress simpsons fans will get it
recommended
one more turn

the flagship turnbased strategy game returns become ruler of the world by establishing and leading a civilization from the dawn of man into the space age wage war conduct diplomacy discover new technologies go headtohead with some of historys greatest leaders and build the most powerful empire the world has ever known or you could just nuke everyone same thing
recommended
let me just say that sid meiers civilization v is a fcking masterpiece you read that right a fcking masterpiece when i first started i was like holy sht this thing more complicated than my english class but then you get the hang of it and you fall in love civ is like a drug but a good drug you get addicted you play endlessly for hours but are you ashamed no youre just proud fcking proud because you had a good time the first time you take over a city in this game is justmagical its like when you lose your virginity to a magnificient lass i havent lost my virginity yet but im only hoping itll be half as good as playing civ itll have to be extremely good and i mean extremely good if it wants to beat playing civ if youre on the fence on deciding whether to buy civ or not get our dumbass off of that fence and buy it already i have spent over 150 hours on it in just a few months and im not even a hardkore gamer seriously buy it that feeling you have of running the greatest empire in the entire world is unparalleled
recommended
great game
recommended
grate game a side from being a masive time vammpier it you do kind of need brave new world if you wount the full esperance then buy brave new world though all in all a grate game

this game taught me what it is to be a huge ucker before i had this gem of a gem of a gem i didnt know what it was to be yoko ono thanks to sid fliers oregon trail viii i can die a happy man my only quip would be the inventory system which is unable to be used because there is not one in the game it took me about five and a half hours to figure out that civ 5 was not an onrails shooter
recommended
i like this game because you get to destroy sweden as many times as you want
recommended
how about u just buy it and play it really nice game 1510 for this game
recommended
bison and cocoa
recommended
if youve played the previous game you might be a little disappointed to find that various elements have been dumbed down or removed completely there is no longer any corporation religion or espionage diplomacy has been simplified to the point of being almost broken and stealing enemy territory through superior culture output is gone altogether also while only allowing 1 military unit per tile does eliminate the problem in previous games where you had massive stacks of troops that could mow down everything in their path it does make it very hard to manage a large army during an invasion and trying to conquer a city that has no land around it is a nightmare since units suffer huge penalties for attacking from water the last major blow to this compared to the previous game is the number of bugs and crashes it was severely unpolished at launch and it still isnt totally finished there is currently still no pitboss app even though it has been promised since before launch
recommended
i would reccomend this game purely because its a good brain thinking stratagy game that really gets you thinking
recommended
knowing i had to be in bed within 1 hour i opened this game 5 hours later i went to bed and still made it to work on time the next morning success would recommend if you dont have a life

its super fun especially coming from someone who doesnt like rtsstrategy games its at its best when you get your friends involved but i highly recommend getting the complete edition its like a whole new game 1010
recommended
id like to start of this review by stating that this was my first civilization game ever and that i played most of the hours on the gold edition versiongods and kings first off i find it very good that the game has workshop support since there are neat little scenarioscivilizationsmodes on the workshop and modding for pc gaming should always be encouragedsupported since i often see it ignored by major publishers graphics are fine for the type of game it looks very pretty and the art style is good and clear to see what means what turnbased gameplay is nice and expected from a civilization gamefrom what i had heard even though sometimes it feels very slow but this is mostly in the early game this isnt a big problem however considering the turns go quickly since the ai doesnt have to make many calculations in that part speaking of the ai sometimes it feels highly irrational and stupid because diplomacy in civ5god and kings is pretty useless because they will just invade you anyway even if they cannot beat your armies to seemingly just annoy you however it does provide a good challenge even if it has to archieve that with cheatsi dislike this since ai should be able to beat you by being smartso that is an issue if you like playing singleplayer like i do however multiplayer doesnt always work like it should because of network issueswith people i could normally play mp games with the complexity of the game could have been better since it does feel like they dumbed it down a biti also play alot of grand strategy games from paradox interactive that are way more complex and this might have made my judgement a bit biasedconsidering what ive heard from previous iterations of the game i do like the removal of doomstacks because that mechanic sounded very broken if i heard about it and civ5 has a nice wonder system that makes you feel proud when you build one and annoyed when an enemy steals it from you city states are nice and amusing because sometimes you can supply them with advanced weapons so you can fight a proxy war
recommended
insanely good linux port fun gameplay and good multiplayer just buy it its a musthave resistance is futile
recommended
the first game ive ever played for 3 hours striaght 1010

school this is the only history class you need no this is the only education you will ever need relive recreate and experience your own historical timelime roleplay as germany as ensure that poland stays down for good or as the one true korea and do what kim jongun only wishes he can do to the westerners 1010 if this game was dug up 1000 years from now and was the only surviving artifact from our time it would be treated with the same respect as if the jewish and catholic bibles were combined along with the quran sid meier himself will hunt you down and physically and emotionally hurt you if you dont buy this
recommended
one minute you think you are gonna hook up with wu the next turn she is attacking your lands 1010 would buy bipolar simulator again
recommended
it is awesome people should buy it
recommended
this game is so sick i have 170 hours on this game its beautilful to see your own civilization grow and it makes you appreciate the finer things like how other rulers can be backstabing s who will let you have pearls for 30 turns for you wine bannanas citrus copper iron and 300 gold then to suddenly launch a preemptive strike on krakow you most prized city and the wheat capital for all civs a word of warning for those who i have convinced to get the game montezuma does not wear pants when you meet him tell him pat sent ya and if he tells you to settle your cities elsewhere tell him to put on some pants

recommended
a great game for lovers of stratagy be warned there is no such thing as a quick game so be prepared to invest alot of hours into it oh and be careful of ghandi if he can nuke you by god he will
recommended
if ive wasted 400 hours of my life on this game you know its good
recommended
one of my most favorite strategic games you can play as most of the countries  like for instance you can conquer the world as gandhi yes like in previous games leaders dont die the music is really nice it fits everytime for instance when you are in war with somebody you have hans zimmerish music and when everything is fine you can hear piano music yes the music can become irritating but there are mods and theres a lot of them but ill write about them later nowgameplay wise you wont be needing any of hard working but you can do whole a lot in the actual game from changing city name to sending spies to other city yes in midgame you can unlock spies and send them to other countries either as diplomats or spies its always fun to see those country leaders react to you eather you trade with them start war or befriend they always talk in their native language now dlc its useless if there wont be leaders as dlc because story isnt the most hardest thing dlcs contain few leaders and boring stories  maps graphics are highly good just look at the water and the last but not least mods you can do a lot of thing from smartening ai to playing as arsotzkapapers please and since steam workshops supports civilization its easier now the price is okay for this game and so with those words i end my review here
recommended
this game is an excellent upgrade from civilization iv they removed the superstacks of soldiers and limited it to one type of unit per tile and that is a major improvement the base civilizations are varied and some are from more hidden parts of history which is a nice change of pace the new tile design of hexagons is also a nice change helping with a strategy change however one of my gripes are the achievements you get them by just playing the game eliminate another civ upgrade a unit find ruins etc even though they have no gameplay impact it is offputting to see supposed achievements in the grand scheme of human achievement those may be but in this sort of game setting they are not applicable overall a great upgrade from civ iv that gets rid of the unnessecary while keeping the fundamentals intact
recommended
civilization v is probably the best balance of in depth customization mixed with easy accessablility it can be as hard as you want it to be or it can be very easy to allow you to learn the mechanics ive played through a few games and im very impressed with the way this game feels and plays i know when it comes to civilization games nostalgia runs wild and everyone always thinks the older ones are superior but i honestly think combined with at least the gods and kings expasion this is the best civilization game to date if youre interested in this game you have to at least get the gold edition this game feels pretty incomplete without the gods and kings expansion but with it it feels perfect i havent gotten brave new world but i hear it is amazing anyway civilization v is highly recommended by me and should be picked up by any strategycivilization fan
recommended
if i had to rate civilization v i would give it a 45 very addictive game you will spend countless hours playing this game and lose track of time i once played this game from 4pm to around 6 or 7amneedless to say i slept for 48 hours i have only played the base game or vanilla game just civilization v and no expansions so i am pretty sure once you get the expansions as well you will lose more hours having fun i have also heard good things about brave new world and plan on buying it in the future it is true though that this game holds your hand throughout the game compared to previous civilizations games but it doesnt stop you from playing the game the controls and the ui  the controls for movement attack defend and general scrolling are spot on and easy to use with a great feel towards them  the ui user interface however is somewhat complex and scattered throughout your screen rather messily it will take some time to get to know the ui but once you figure it out you will stroll right through it gameplay and general  the leaders of the civilizations when in the negotiating screen are just simply amazing to look at great detail has went into themthe problem with this though is that you will get fed up looking at them from time to time and just end up declaring war on themjust because you can  advisors in the game are supposed to advise you in what to do nexthoweverthey are completly useless and their advise is rubbish never trust an advisor they plan to take over  ai aritificial intelligence are somewhat dumb at times i played a single player game on the hardest difficulty deity and within 2 turns of starting the game every single civilization declared war on me and within 3 turns destroyed me with triple the amount of units i was able to put out i tried again this time germany and japan declared war on me before the end of my first turnheh  city states are states that you can trade with or annexraze the easiest thng to do with them is to annex them as after a certain amount of time they tend to get annoying but dont capture many of them as they will all become in a permanent state of war with you but oddly enough hardly ever attack you  when starting a game it has alot of options to choose from and can greatly enhance the experience  steam workshop is the best addition to the gamethe mods are glorious the community is glorious everything is glorious the sheer amount of mods available is just mindboggling overall overall if i had to rate this game i would give it a 4 out of 5 stars the sheer enjoyment i got from it is amazing even though ive only played it for 30 hours i want to play it more but got other stuff to do as well i cant rate the multiplayer aspect of this game as i am too scared to get my noobiness owned  buy it it is worth it
recommended
ill let my 4digit hours logged speak for themselves

fantastic game so many civs you can play as if you love strategy games then youll love this one its great on its own but even better with the dlcs it requires skill patience and determination as theres many ways to win eg domination culture science etc i highly recommend it
recommended
softcore grand strategy adequate amount of options and gameplay elements to keep you interested extremely active community and a learning curve that will not leave you hunging never overwhelms with info or anything like that recommended for new players and veterans alike 45

sid meiers civilisation v has been said to be more crippling to ones life than a heavy heroin addiction and i think this could not be more true the game causes arguments between friends because like the nigerian child slavery business it is highly competitive but also fun for all ages 10 i know my wife left me after i beat her as a result of her winning a science victory when i was one turn away one ing turn  this game can be played alone or with friends but i only play alone the best civilisation is the usa civilisation when they enter the industrial era you can use your mcdonalds farming in africa ability to cripple other civilisations such as ethiopia with a secondary obesity disadvantage to other firstworld civilisations the one weakness of the american civilisation is only available to exploit after the construction of the monument the twin towers       my other favorite civillisation is the japanese civilisation their special ability is the  or kamikaze ability which destroys your unit in a fiery blaze of glory while dealing an immense amount of damage to the enemy western devils my least favorite cilvisation is the aztec civilisation because their leader montecarlo always decides to attack me even when i have the stronger army and while everyone else has firearms the aztecs are stuck in leopard suits using what seems to be a rudimentray scarecrow as a weapon ing crows stealing my maize the game has added many interesting features such as religion economics scienceyawn basically sid has mocked me by introducing every subject i failed dismally at school into the game as some sort of message yeah well well  you sid you can found one of 8 different religions each as tedious as the next and the science tree isnt much better in fact its actually quite revealing about the sick minds of the developers for example one of the first techs you require is animal husbandry yes thats right folks and if you thought besitality was abhorrent you will be disgusted to know the game also includes quotes from george bush jr all in all much like a heroin addict is to heroin you will find this game addictive and draining enjoyable to an almost euphoric level and you wont be able to quit buying more ing sid and his never ending dlc i mean the game came out in 2010 for s sake and theyre still milking the market 220214 oh yiss golden age mother er

sid meiers civilization v is an excellent strategy game for gamers of all ages it is wellmade and entertaining i would give this masterpiece five stars out of a maximum of five stars
recommended
civilization v projects a sense of quality that few 4x games can match thats not to say that the game play is perfect or there arent minor issues to solve however the quality of the game itself is unmatched in the current market the ui is crisp and intuitive a pitfall of many 4x games the menus are clear and precise and the overall feel of the game is wonderful the only real complaint that i have is regarding the ai on higher difficulties the ai is simply given absurd bonuses of gold and happiness modifies to make them more of a threat noncombat victories become extremely more difficult to attain than combat victories however to be fair this is a rational process in some ways and the latest expansion did help with that aspect once your borders are touching an ai civ its generally going to end in them declaring war on you however as far as 4x games though this is absolutely worth a try

brave new world makes this incredible

i played a lot of civilization 4 back in the day with my brother and went into this one kind of expecting the same thing big mistake  theyve streamlined some of the annoying things like limiting your resources instead of having unlimited supplies  theyve improved the combat side by removing the stacking of units on a single tile and steam rolling over everything  theyve also removed the need to build transports for continent naval invasion which for me is a major plus point the downside however  with the streamlining process is the lack of control over the finer details  you cant select all your cities on the same content to mass produce units or buildings anymore  you cant pull up a chart summarizing all the nations power or overall growth overall it is definitely a step in right direction but it lost a lot useful things along the way 810

civilization games are brilliant ive played the second the third and now the fifth i liked every single ones of them they bring a very enjoyable turn by turn experience which makes it so you can think as long as you wish before you do an action allowing you to think deeply about your next move i still do not fully understand civilization but i like it theres alot of civilizations and leaders to play around with you can also play however you prefer via the strategic view or the normal one if youre looking for a turn by turn strategy game and you havent played civilization games try any of them or watch gameplays you wont regret it theyre popular and addicting

in this video game sid myers civ 5 you take control of a country of your choosing which if your not a baka gaijin would be the glorious nation of nippon tahts japan for u stupid foreighner to defeat the horrible western country called america for not understanding the medium of anime which as i have said 10 oku times is totally different from youre stupid childish idiot cartoon this game is a lot of fun and reminds me somehat of japans own fire emblem video game series but they forgot the most important part of the japanese culture anime the developers square enix have thankfully added the map of japan as a playable stage which is glorious and also the only map i ever play this game is fairly old but the developers atlus added many epic expansions such as the gods and kings expansion which is by far the best as it adds religion and the greatest religion there is shinto straight from japan you can also make your own religions and spread it to other countries and they will if they understand anything accept shinto as their one true religion and then u win the game because uh beliefing in shinto is winning in real life as im shore a smart fellow such as youreself can undersand i will give this game a full 1010 for its love for japan but take that down to a 9 as i cant call my cities  so i just call it tky or east capital instead buy this game this is lewisdono signing out
recommended
if youre a fan of this genre of games civ 5 is for you this game really isnt advised for people who like fast paced games as even on the quick mode matches still tend to last hours its still really fun though going from a small city to a huge empire spanning the entire map if you have friends to play this game with you really should do that as ive played games with a group of friends for hours and we have had a blast 610 bretty good

nukes and sweden make this game a 1010 260 noscope must buy but since denmark is in this game i give this game a 210 there are mods that removes denmark from the game i highly recommend playing with those mods as it makes the game 3000% better

surpassing 250 hours and counting civ v is and will continue to be the greatest strategy game of all time nothing ive ever come across can top the attention to detail the vast number of playable nations or the replayability of civilization v and ive played a lot of strategy games theres a reason this is 1 on my steam list for games played its outstanding

this game is terrific and fun to play with friends

if you want to be manly and own one of the most sexy realistic and educational no one cares about that stategy game evvvvvvvvvvverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr then dont get age of empires get sid meiers civilization 5 warning game is only fun with gods and kings and brave new worlds i recomend you stay away from babylon because they are the most op civ in the game this game cannot protect from doing homework it does the exact opposite of that we are not responsible of friend loss or any finger loss sid meier not included
recommended
this game is super addicting its enormous fun with the steam workshop hundreds of custom content are at your fingertips to control
recommended
this is definitely the most strategical game ive ever played i lost the very first time i played i retired because i went my gold count went negative and someone declared war on me lol this game is so much fun and very realisticlogical in my opinion there are an endless number of paths to take to make your civilization the best civilization in its time or make it crumble to pieces like mine did ^_^ even thoough the game may be found to be very challenging there are several different modes to choose from starting from the easiest of easy the sound tracks are very good and goes perfect with the type of game it is there is so much to do on this game and its so addicting there are a couple of things though that i wish this game had i wish it had a better tutorial throughout the game some of the tips can be a bit confusing however i am glad there there is a civilopedia in which several terms in the game are clearly defined my tip to you is to make sure that your first city is founded in a place that promises a good amount of resources and gold although i was gifted this game 3 i would definitely recommend buying this game even buying it for full price 9510

this game is one of the best strategy games out there right now and thats saying something this is definitely the best gateway into strategy games you can find and it is well worth it esspecially if you have both expansions the game changes so much even in asthetics between gods and kings and brave new world bnw definitely completes the game and i find it only in very specific situations that i play a game without it once you get used to the system i promise you youll find out what civs you want to always ally or always destroy for personal achievement and not just the sake of progress definitely a musthave strategy game

sid meiers civilization v is a grand strategy game that uses a hex based tile system in basic terms its at heart a really huge board game the player builds his civilization starting with a single settler and a warrior builds his capital city and continues to create his own religiongods and kings amass great armies and even construct wonders civ 5s gameplay is somewhat simpler to first pick up than its roots and this gives new players a fairly easy time playing italong with rewarding long time players for their time from a deeper complex metagame single player games will last anything from 5 to well literally hundreds of hours every playthrough offering a pretty unique experience the game also offers a large choice of well balanced civilisations to choose from and also a huge selection of unique maps of many sizes when this is combined with steamworks modding community the possibilities are close to infinite from lord of the rings style maps to mass effect the games graphics are clear and well optimised the game giving you the option to play in dx91011 and even a windows 8 touch enabled mode the game also feature an 2d overview mode if the 3d interface becomes too complexthe soundtrack is epic and in those long long games it keeps you immersed and it has enough variety that repetition is rarely noticed the online of civ5 is really where it shines although the occasional network bug will desync the game the majority of the time if your connection is stable you will have a great multiplayer experience with the brave new worlds expansion there is now three multiplayer modes to choose from standard hot seat and pit boss hotseat is the most unique of these allowing multiple people to play a game on one machine offline taking turns to play pit boss uses a dedicated server to host the game for those long term games the games standard mode also features both lan and online play a fantastic grand strategy game be prepared to burn 100s of hours playing games with your friends that you will likely never get to the end of and will keep you entertained with its depth and creativity its a must have pc title

1 you meet gandhi as you find uranium shortly after 2 you both become allies after his struggle for food in his civilization 3 gandhi starts to look suspicious after the local uranium is mined 4 your halfway through to building your spaceship 5 gandhi suddenly allies with someone else 6 gandhi betrays you and declares war 7 you create nukes to nuke him but your realise he has already made nukes 8 gandhi nukes your civlization and every other leader 9 you regret meeting gandhi 10 gandhi wins the game by finishing his spaceship and sending it to space 11 you tableflip and throw your pc out the window 1010 would get nuked and rage again

infinite replayability interested and worthy modding community i have now 5 core mods that tend to recreate the newness of the game play after thousands of hours of playtime also the free maps mad by modders expand the possibilities again beyond the generic game in what seems like an endless parade of newness extensive forum help in and outside of steam is always at hand steam dependability is itself a great thing a great strategy game to me it is my favorite after a long time playing older nonciv strategy titles such as empire earth and rise of nations ah ron in its day if you have a robust pc to play with the visuals and animations are very enjoyable transition times can be tedious late in game and one can linger long into the next morning without realizing it because one more turn always begs for one more turn

this is the quintessential game for your ruler in the making with many different civilizations to choose from each with their own special abilities youre able to take your civ from its birth to ruling the world also ghandi is a

amazing game imo but only fun for people who are patient and enjoy long strategy games

one of the best games i have ever bought

very good game highly recommend but only if youre going to play in a group of 4 people single player gets very repetitive and boring but in a group of friends it can get competitive and will last for hours graphics arent bad and the view controls are simple but more than enough for what you need to do
recommended
let me just say that sid meiers civilization v is a fcking masterpiece you read that right a fcking masterpiece when i first started i was like holy sht this thing more complicated than my english class but then you get the hang of it and you fall in love civ is like a drug but a good drug you get addicted you play endlessly for hours but are you ashamed no youre just proud fcking proud because you had a good time the first time you take over a city in this game is justmagical its like when you lose your virginity to a magnificient lass i havent lost my virginity yet but im only hoping itll be half as good as playing civ itll have to be extremely good and i mean extremely good if it wants to beat playing civ if youre on the fence on deciding whether to buy civ or not get our dumbass off of that fence and buy it already i have spent over 150 hours on it in just a few months and im not even a hardkore gamer seriously buy it that feeling you have of running the greatest empire in the entire world is unparalleled
recommended
this is where strategy tactics and the power of your mind comes into actionm this breathtaking new addtion to the series is the best most powerful and well done game to hit the pc yet also reccomend the civ revoultion along with teh spectacular new dlc gods and kings which starts to bring a whole new aspect of endurance reations and quick thinking into your own world your own hero you are the leader of the revoultion of strategy gaming at its best

recommended
being the fifth in the series there could be some people that say its on its last legs theyre wrong not only does this game have addicting game elements from a game design standpoint its phenomenal the hexagon grid style is perfect for this type of game and the jump from the fourth is outrageous new players can easily get into this game as it has a plethora of game options to make it unique for the players skill level the game uses the concept of technology trees which means in order to obtain this ability you must obtain this in which to obtain this you must research this etc there are also time options for how long you want the game to last playing a game on quick makes it pretty fast and takes a small amount of turns to complete epic on the other hand invloves an all in commitment and i have competeted one epic game which was possibly the best game of civilization v ive played for now this game also has steam workshop which adds new civilizations and areas but along with pros there are cons something that i must say is the worst is the way the workers work they occasionally just stop doing whatever when you set them on automated and then next thing you know they get captured during a war absolutely ridiculous another thing is the amount of dlc for the game its outrageous but the gods and kings dlc is probably the best but these could have been just updates for free and i would still love it do i recommend it absolutely 910 sucks a lot of time but its totally worth it to see the roman empire take over the earth

id like to start of this review by stating that this was my first civilization game ever and that i played most of the hours on the gold edition versiongods and kings first off i find it very good that the game has workshop support since there are neat little scenarioscivilizationsmodes on the workshop and modding for pc gaming should always be encouragedsupported since i often see it ignored by major publishers graphics are fine for the type of game it looks very pretty and the art style is good and clear to see what means what turnbased gameplay is nice and expected from a civilization gamefrom what i had heard even though sometimes it feels very slow but this is mostly in the early game this isnt a big problem however considering the turns go quickly since the ai doesnt have to make many calculations in that part speaking of the ai sometimes it feels highly irrational and stupid because diplomacy in civ5god and kings is pretty useless because they will just invade you anyway even if they cannot beat your armies to seemingly just annoy you however it does provide a good challenge even if it has to archieve that with cheatsi dislike this since ai should be able to beat you by being smartso that is an issue if you like playing singleplayer like i do however multiplayer doesnt always work like it should because of network issueswith people i could normally play mp games with the complexity of the game could have been better since it does feel like they dumbed it down a biti also play alot of grand strategy games from paradox interactive that are way more complex and this might have made my judgement a bit biasedconsidering what ive heard from previous iterations of the game i do like the removal of doomstacks because that mechanic sounded very broken if i heard about it and civ5 has a nice wonder system that makes you feel proud when you build one and annoyed when an enemy steals it from you city states are nice and amusing because sometimes you can supply them with advanced weapons so you can fight a proxy war

yeah its good

one of the best games of all time

a really great game take control of your favorite civilization and compete against others for victory amazing multiplayer experience truly fun to play with friends i seriously recommend at least the gold edition as the vanilla game isnt quite good compared to what it is now with all the expansions and dlc it also goes on sale often and i think that for the price you pay when it is on sale its an experience that cannot be overlooked
recommended
sir the civlization v community is too strong may i recommend we give in and purchase this game military advisor our game is producing 1999 with our  copies of the game now thats efficiency science advisor consider what our customers might be planning but not too much if you did i wouldnt have a job foreign advisor we are making money our current greatest expense is redistributing the game to customers consider producing more dlcs for our customers if you want to turn an even greater profit economic advisor

this game as you can probably tell by how much ive played it is quite addicting its beginner friendly but still has advanced aspects for more experienced players the major downside is that if you only buy the base game its quite repetitive i recommend to purchase the complete edition the game also has a workshop which adds more variety to the game i once used a mod which spawned all the civilizations in true geographical areas which actually taught me some true locations of countries which i didnt previously know overall good game 1010 could ruin your life

ive never been good at writing reviews and couldnt think of anything to put so heres a recipe for falafel ingredients 1 cup dried chickpeas or 16 oz can of chickpeas or garbanzo beans 1 large onion chopped 2 cloves of garlic chopped 3 tablespoons of fresh parsley chopped 1 teaspoon coriander 1 teaspoon cumin 2 tablespoons flour salt pepper oil for frying prep time 15 minutes cook time 105 minutes total time 120 minutes preparation place dried chickpeas in a bowl covering with cold water allow to soak overnight omit this step if using canned beans drain chickpeas and place in pan with fresh water and bring to a boil allow to boil for 5 minutes then let simmer on low for about an hour drain and allow to cool for 15 minutes combine chickpeas garlic onion coriander cumin salt and pepper to taste in medium bowl add flour mash chickpeas ensuring to mix ingredients together you can also combine ingredients in a food processor you want the result to be a thick paste form the mixture into small balls about the size of a ping pong ball slightly flatten fry in 2 inches of oil at 350 degrees until golden brown 57 minutes serve hot serving suggestion falafel can be served as an appetizer with hummus and tahini or as a main course stuff pita bread with falafel lettuce tomatoes tahini salt and pepper as an alternative falafel can be formed into patties and served like a burger thanks for reading my review i hope it has been helpful

this game taught me what it is to be a huge ucker before i had this gem of a gem of a gem i didnt know what it was to be yoko ono thanks to sid fliers oregon trail viii i can die a happy man my only quip would be the inventory system which is unable to be used because there is not one in the game it took me about five and a half hours to figure out that civ 5 was not an onrails shooter

the game play of civ v can be likened to that one party back in the late 80s you went to you know that one where your friends ditched you to go party with those hot chicks that worked at the mall and you wound up hanging out with the coke head that used to pick his nose in study hall he gives you that first bump it takes a few seconds and you start to feel something tingle you feel a little bit more a live wired you could say in civ v you found your first city everything feels fresh and exciting youre braving new ground here wired you could say pretty soon cokie gives you a second bump your blood beings to flow a little faster you can see things a little quicker music starts to take shape in your brain bringing to life something new in civ v you send your warriors exploring maybe you start to build a worker your adrenalines picking up a bit youre excited for whats going to happen next excited for your future pretty soon a monument pops up in your city a citizen moves in youve given life to something new now you and cokie youre on a roll youre rocking and rolling youre taking your bumps sustaining the electricty youre dancing life springs eternal aroudn you and you are in tune with the world your cities are growing your military is taking shape and becoming formiddable your culture is alive and strong your infrastructure is vast and carries life to all of your cities like the blood that throbs in your veins its about 2am and you and cokie you guys are starting to peak you feel like you can conquer the world with the power that pulses within you your kingdom its pulsing with power as well you start to conquer your neighboring citystates not to right wrongs not to engulf their resources simply because you can then it happens its 3am and youre starting to crash your body feels limp you are starting to sweat the weakness starts to spread tangible and sweet you cant take much more back in sid meier land alexander the great he got tired of your brutal ways and decided to smack you around hes closing in on your borders your outlying puppet master cities began to falter your borders begin to shrink and then at both that coke fueled party in the late 80s and in your imaginary kingdom that youve built in sid meiers civ v you blink and realize its 6am you havent slept you cant remember what youve done for the last 8 hours but you vaguely remember having a hell of a time doing whatever it was you did theres just that one nagging thought that youre afraid catherine of russia may call you that last night and youre pretty certain you should feel bad for the way you treated her last night thats what playign civ v is like

a first time experience story started as france started exploring around met morocco and instantly declared war lost war but we had a peace treaty met greece greece has already claimed most of the map me and morocco declare war on greece at the same time we both lose our capitals greece made me lose the game because he was annoying never even made it to the medieval age and that all happened in about an hour

pro build your civ from the stoneage towards the spaceage varied maps and game options mostly peacefull gameplay which can be quite relaxing if you are looking for something else from the usual con terrible programming 32 bit lua performance issues even if you have more then capable hardware i5 3570kgtx780 resulting in longer turns then necessary ultimately forcing you to play small maps bad netcode making it hard to join matches and creating lag during the game the interface could be alot better many basic things are simply not present such as unit overview instead the computer forcibly leads you along from one unit to the next but sometimes a few of the units get missed or they wake up from their sleep again in short it is an oversight of epic proportions and a major sadness as there are not many nice games such as this that dont require you to kill verdict 78 bucks is definitely fine for the complete edition and you can find it for that price online if they fix the issues in a new title im also willing to pay more but not like this

sid meiers civilization v  lol this gr8 strategy game is really really time costly  like if u get pretty engaged in it itll take away from u half of ur life  ok maybe thats exaggerating lets say 14 of ur life but yeah cause the matches can go on for tens of hours @ the end u can spend in total like entire days on big matches in fact the 270 achievements rnt easy to win duh yep x3 also the units rnt in scale also the characters played by the ai r complete ssholes  when or not hostile doesnt matter always morons xc ill slap ur sses mothafckers but however all that this is 1 of the best strategy games ive ever played if not the best ah no wait this is the best strategy game ive ever played hands down thats right i like the gameplay @ turns that makes everything more manageble i like the gr8 variety of options i like the personalization of each character i like the different winning objectives i like the list of units i like the great wall  i like the nuclear submarine  i like the krakatoa  i catherine of russia best waifu also if shtty temperament like all the others i like the cows so in the end i like the game overall xd

seriously together me and my dad have played over 1000 hours of this game you never get bored because of the almost infinite possibilities available you can rule your nation that could be in tundra the desert by the coast big ships   on an island in forest or all of them spanning the entire earth conquest is fun you will be pitted against the greatest historical and modern and future with a mod oh yes mods nations ever to have existed at whatever difficulty you want you play how you play literally however you want evil overlord go for it best turnbased strategy ever to exist ah unless you dont get the dlc of course g&k and bnw then you might as well get civ 4 costing a grand total of 5

ive only played this game for a fraction of the time others have played but i plan on spending much more due to the complexity and overall reward of playing this game although i remain skeptical of newer civ versions this one seems very well developed and has already proven to be lots of fun if youre having a hard time justifying the large cost of this game like i was just have a look at the play time of other people reviewing this good and bad reviews theres so much content in this game especially with the dlc which i recommend
recommended
civ v is on of those games that you have heard great things about but arent sure if youll like it you buy it when its on sale and then immediatley lose your entire day playing it strategizing on when you should declare war or who should be your ally it does have some minor flaws but the fun you have both by yourself or with friends outsizes the few flaws i found
recommended

recommended
ruined my entire life 1010
recommended
at its bare bones without expansions this game tends to start out boring but when you feel the real general gist of the game it turns out to be quite the gem of the steam store whether you want to play the peaceful diplomat or the fearsome warrior i would say a good game for any strategy lover

an interesting read for children of all ages sid meiers fantastic four v is a twist on the fps genre with its inclusion of a fully interactional book store i gotta say though i thought the lack of avengers in this game was disappointing i still have hope for a crossover event come the next game though choice10
recommended
best strategy game that is around now most definitely a keeper
recommended
meh it was ok i guess jk best game ive ever played
recommended
this game is like a drugonce you start you never stop
recommended
when this game works it is really fun and enjoyable once you learn the mechanics and dont have a ing troll on the other team taking ages to make their turn when the game doesnt work server crashes etc this game allows you to save and reload your game but have fun trying to get everyone reconnected and the game running again as it seems that you have to leave one person out for the game to work again
recommended
great historical accuracy with this game i know i can ace my history exam who knew gandhi was a heartless evil warmonger who would nuke the world into oblivion

when you first play civ v you wonder how many times will i need to restart this until jolpe finds a decent spawn place then you wonder will that guy just hit ing next turn already but the true magic of civilization v is when barbarian  come and burn down your horses so you repair them with a hammer only in sieve thive

very nice game it is based on geological history very mutch how strong your nation is depends on all geological factors that are around you combined with the specialisation of the civilization you choose fun to play
recommended
civilization v or civilisation v if you can spell correctly is a game that not only destroys both your social life and your daily sleep pattern but it can also lead to the destruction of your sanity after a prolonged exposure to this particular substance however this is in my opinion a small price to pay for some everlasting enjoyment the euphoria you experience while wheelchairbound obese and bosseyed or strabismus for you budding austists out there is priceless compared to that  family christmas you have to endure every  year  correct i know i am as such i am happy to recommend this game to anyone who appreciates good smack or has an addiction they wish to devleop into something more hardcore i can safely say that this game will give you everything the ai will offer you love the interface will offer you wisdom while the gameplay will offer you eternal happiness from the second you prepare your  for this amazing entry if youll pardon the pun

this games going to ruin my life calling it now

civ is a game that is really hard to mess up and civ v and its dlc are just plain awesome brave new world alone adds so much to the game be warned if you have never played before though the game is a bit of a life suck i should know as i am close to having 1000 hours in the game

after initially being impatient to play the civilization game series when i played iii for a bit i regret that decision because i was too impatient to play what would of been one of my most favourite strategy games i got this game from the recent humble bundle and i got to say after playing a good 6 hours on this game that it is one of my most favourite games to play there is ghandi who is an  dont trust him he lies and nukes you in the back when you least expect it nothing else i should say here other than 1010 get it now and ruin your life with this addiction

wellwhat a game i was worried about getting civ 5 as id only ever had civ 3 and clocked a good few hundred hours on that a good few years back until i got civ 4 civ 4 is awful and wouldnt recommend it but civ 5 ye youve got world congress can become united nations the units are amazing so many more buildings better techs and graphics are quite good strategy games may not be your thing but i think civ 5 will be
recommended
at this point if you havent heard of this game please quit steam this game is amazing in everyway and the variability between games ensures that it never gets old there are enough features to keep players busy even when they are not in the middle of a war just buy it and all the dlc it is worth it no matter what you think of strategy games
recommended
pretty fun game i am not the best at it but i love it to pieces pros highly strategic turnbased gameplay beautiful landscapes unique items for each leader extra funand expensive dlc cons none that i can think of 1010
recommended
theres a few things that i dont like about the transition from civilization iv to v but overall its an incredible improvement the visual improvements are outstanding there are a few things i wish were implemented from iv like trading maps trading technologys world editor but all these things are made available by community workshop mods
recommended
become the megalomaniac you always wanted to be just as good as it always was

ive put more time into this game than most so id say im qualified to write this i really enjoy the gun attachments and the killstreaks however the nudity is very excessive and overblown id rather jerk off my grandfather sometimes
recommended
the brave new world dlc has boobs 1010 best art boobs ive seen
recommended
at first i didnt see many reasons to play online without someone i know so in the back of my mind i was regretting clicking on multiplayer but after playing as indonesia in a group of 6 other online players i saw how intense this turnbased could become i can assure everyone that the multiplayer is 9000 times more intense than the singleplayer against ai and the only way to find that out is by playing multiplayer for the nutmeg
recommended
do you think you sleep too much do you have too much spare time worry no more  the nevest civ is here get started and after you have played one more turn your alarm reminds you that 18 hours have passed and its time to get to school again great game
recommended
it took me 104 hours but i finally won my first civ 5 game as george washington world leader i wiped ghandi off the map before he could screw me over like usual using my christian nuclear arsenal i erased him from history when his epitaph played and america immediately immediately began a golden age despite everyone in the world denouncing me i popped a raging boner making all 104 hours worthwhile
recommended
i never realized that this was actually fun
recommended
civilization v is the great strategy game youre can make a big civilization and social with other civilizations youre can fight with them or be friendly all decisions i yours
recommended
this game is pretty good a lot of fun with friends especially
recommended
perfect way to lose about three days of your life all in one sitting and its even better when you lose it with a bunch of friends with about the same motivation to nuke everything as you
recommended
good strategic elements high amount of replay value getting the steam achievements also make for interesting challenges allowing you explore the other leaders and civs
recommended
quite addictive worth it
recommended
i didnt get alot of time to try everything in this game  but i can tell  this game rocks
recommended
i love this game it can be really fun to play with friends when youre winning and fun when youre not 3 this game is really cool because you can do so much and it is also a game that requires you to think use skill and strategy rather than simply pointing and shooting and it has so many details and interesting game mechanics while not being overlycomplicated
recommended
once you buy this game and know how to play it your butt will stuck on a chair for a day  1010

with all the dlc its probably one of the most entertaining games i have played

recommended
this game is amazing if you play with friends it is so funny
recommended
this game is a turn based game where you control a civilization of your choosing and survive the tests of time it is a ton of fun with friends the single player npc civilizations are a bit brain dead but still fun to play with you never have nothing to do in this game there is always something happening each turn and wont stop throughout the beginning is a bit hard on you but you will get used to it i totally recommend this game to anyone who wants a nice rts and has a moderate pc
recommended
1110 would recommend
recommended
very fun and some nice long games u can have makes this better because if u have a games like aoe tht will last an hour then u play another with this there r the various victorys and different ai attitudes besides gahndi and with long lasting games its harder to get bored of get it on sale while u can

recommended
one of the best strategy games of our time
recommended
i bought this and played it with my friends for a couple hours they soon left i think and then i went into singleplayer i made some progress then my friends called me up to play again then i realized what time it was 1010
recommended
brilliant game  however it requires a patient mind if you are not willing to play a game which lasts hours to complete this game is not for you if you are patient enough this game is among the best games that you will play good with or without dlc though dlc does enhance gameplay greatly
recommended
i think there are no doubts only one game what rules them all and thats it its the civ series civ 5 is not so complex as civ 4 but still realy good one  i played it like houndred of hours and now i bought original version from steam 
recommended
first time ever playing a civilization game i played nonstop for five straight hours 1110
recommended
overall a phenomenal title albeit the bugs most common in multiplayer modes gpuintensive code my laptop has shut down due to overheating and long loading times may agitate impatient minds the series as a whole being the flagship for the casual rts genre this installation should by no means be passed up despite various software difficulties both multiplayer and singleplayer modes have proven to be largely enjoyable and full of replay value with features such as 43 unique and as a result quite unbalanced playable civilizations with different abilities and units an extensive collection of maps and map types and many scenario settings as well the brave new world expansion has also proven itself as an exceptional update to the core game rules and numerous other extensions to an already remarkable gameplay experience this expansion is considered by many a necessary part of the civilization experience i would recommend this game to any and all that can appreciate an entertaining afternoon of politicsfilled evolutionbased strategy gaming with friends
recommended
very fun and addicting but the complete edition really shouldnt be $50 i recommend getting it when its on sale
recommended
very good game i would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy genres the graphics for me are supurb and the little animations when you battle singleplayer in my first game my tank anihalated a spearmen and the animation to me very funny great game
recommended
best strategy game ever dont underestimate it  its amazing
recommended
the great lighthouse has been built in a far away land ddd haha nice what can i say a clear 1010

recommended
its a good game

well this is fun if youre a huge nerd and im not that huge of a nerd so it wasnt so fun so to sum this up ing nerds k yourselfs
recommended
accidentally started a world war consisted of around three nations rome byzantium ethiopia on my side and two on the other egypt and germany with a few neutral bigots watching the mayhem after around twenty years of fighting germany was a skeleton of what it used to be and egypt frantically sending diplomats to reach a peace agreement as i sent my army and navy to enact a fullfledged invasion of the egyptian mainland god i love this game
recommended
if you want a game that has tons of replay value a very in depth technology tree and loads of historical people that youve never heard of then this grand strategy is definitely for you i bought it and havent regretted it
recommended
eveyone declared war 1010
recommended
this game is worth about $30 total for all dlc $120 is crazy if you spent $120 on this game wow i pity tha foo edit i feel i should mention a few things specifically that bothered me 1 ai is completely worthless all they do on higher difficulty is cheat but remain completly  in combat and diplomacy for example i can save a civ that i had been trading with and gifting to for centeries and was conquered by another civ but just because we have close borders they declare war on me the next turn the trades are crazy stupid they rarely are worth it i can gift a civ resources for 90 turns then ask for a fair trade and they refuse 2 combat with a large army is tedious beyond belief 3 gifting units is broken sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt how the mechanics workdont work is never explained and no one on the forums seems to know either 4 the devs focus on selling dlc instead of fixing the base game dont support bad devs $120 for this broken game is insane i got gods & kings version on sale for $15base game and previous dlc included that was a fair price if bnw drops below $15 i might consider buying it but not likely i would hate to give money to these incompitent money grubbing  devs i recommend this game if you can get if for less than $30 totalall dlc otherwise move along or go back to civ iv a much better game
recommended
this game is an awesome strategy game for people who like to play stuff slow paced in this game you choose a leader for an empirecountry and you have to develop it to have military food for your people your peoples culture scientific discoveries gold and your peoples happiness it may seem overwhelming butbecause of how slowpace the game is it is easy to grasp you can choose to play solo with bots which have many options for their difficulty ranging from just bought the game to pretty much impossible to win because of the bots handicaps < that is just a range of the levels of difficulty not the actual options you can also choose to play with actual people if you do this id recommend the people you play with be a group of friends or just 1 friend because you never really complete the game with strangers sometimes their connection is janky key word their the game doesnt have dedicated servers so lag isnt the games fault or people are just really slow plus you sometimes get kicked when you join a lobby so in my expierence multiplayer isnt worth playing with strangers only a group of or one friend this game really makes the time you invest into it worth it the games last around 10 hours each so playing by yourself on your own time is awesome and you can customize your empire and win through many choices of victories all and all this game is for an avid strategy gamer who likes slow paced games

its like the other civilization games only better
recommended
this is a game for someone looking to break into the world of strategy games even expierienced players can enjoy having fun with this ive played plenty of strategy games starting with civ 3 and all the way up to europa universalis 4 i still enjoy playing this for fun ps never trust anyone peaceful in real lifeeg ghandi remember to never stop slamming probably space jam
recommended
insanely fun with the dlcs time is nonexistent when playing this game
recommended
ive been confined in my household on a sunny day for four hours playing this game thats not like me i do go outside sometimes but just one more turn seriously it sounds kinda stupid that a low paced strategy game has addiction ever wanna take control of a nations politics trading resources warfare nuclear warfare randomly generated maps religions news and hunting what about making a city grow like simcity yeah you know what i mean dont forget tactics to warfare and strategies dont forget the sandbox and modding experience for this game my addiction to this game is settled ill be playing this for a long time
recommended
so much fun with friends
recommended
its good well made and fun i recommend it
recommended
dear bismark  you signed a pacifist
recommended
i love this game the strategic value to it is perfect its indepth enough to pose a challenge yet not so much that it has an insane learning curve the one problem i can find and it isnt one that bothers me but the length of the games is crazy it isnt unheard of for a single game to go on for 24 hours now as i previously mentioned this doesnt bother me but for some people that are just looking for a casual strategy game this could cause some time restraints and for those of you who like the short singlesentence reviews and dont really want to read what i have typed nuked japan and completed space travel in 1903 1010
recommended
this may not be the best installment of these series personally but is by far the most entertaining one a lot of detail was cut from the previous game but all in order to make the experience more dynamic thanks to this civ v has te best multiplayer of the saga recommended for the hardcore fans the casual gamers the strategy aficionado on anyone with the slightest interest this game is brilliant in all aspects
recommended
the damn cutscene at the start is misleading
recommended
cant shank anyone 010 game of the year

good game dlc not worth it though

at this point if you havent heard of this game please quit steam this game is amazing in everyway and the variability between games ensures that it never gets old there are enough features to keep players busy even when they are not in the middle of a war just buy it and all the dlc it is worth it no matter what you think of strategy games
recommended
pretty fun game i am not the best at it but i love it to pieces pros highly strategic turnbased gameplay beautiful landscapes unique items for each leader extra funand expensive dlc cons none that i can think of 1010
recommended
theres a few things that i dont like about the transition from civilization iv to v but overall its an incredible improvement the visual improvements are outstanding there are a few things i wish were implemented from iv like trading maps trading technologys world editor but all these things are made available by community workshop mods

become the megalomaniac you always wanted to be just as good as it always was
recommended
an extremly time consuming game that is just amazing the dlc for it is well worth it if you have the extra money and overall this game is just simply amazing
recommended
fun turn based strategy game single player is good with quite a few difficulty levels but the multiplayer is poorly optomized so crashes and lags a lot
recommended
classic and great in coop multiplayer

this game is great just dont be dissapointed when it is impossible to win without a war as the ai seems to have either mood swings or multiple personality disorder you can shower them with gifts or trade nonstop with them but as soon as your borders are visible from theirs or you have a weak military they will pounce on you without hesitation they even say backstap in the dialogue box this annoys me as i want to play the game nicely but very few of my friends have the game and random online matches often have dlc which i do not im sorry about this mini rant this game is fabulous and the repeatability amazing but seriously if you want to play vs ai peacefully get a mod

what a game
recommended
very fun game that requires much strategy
recommended
when you decide to play civ 5 dont be surprised when five hours later your still playing in the same game
recommended
i love this game i love the new system without the stacking ability it allows for players caught off gaurd to be able to put up some form of fight unfortunately when i bought the game i did not get all the upgrade packages which stinks because i am only missing a few but they are too expensive for it to make sense to buy them by themselves overall good deal though and good game im not excited about the next civilization so i plan on playing this one for a while

sid meiers civilization v is a great turn based strategy game with interesting game mechanics and great historical progression although the game has a big learning curve it is great to play with friends once you get past the learning curve beware if you do get into this game days will pass and it will have only felt like minutes

excellent game solid 1010 value warning youll think oh yeah ill go to bed after this turn forget 200 turns later and suddenly realise youve spent 5 hours extra managing workers and crushing dido
recommended
a simple but very well polished game infinite scenarios each unique and enjoyable highly advised
recommended
one more turn
recommended
i bought this game 20 minutes ago and i already have 35 hours in it
recommended
i laughed i cried i played this game for 20 hours straight buy it
recommended
so far the worst time sink i have ever encountered one more turn has become a negative comment in my household both children and wife threatening me since i started to play this game not only is the base game one of the best strategy games i have ever played the sheer number of mods available make this game an almost infinite time playable game
recommended
by far the most addicting game on steam i swear you sit down and turn around not only is your youth gone but so is your innocene and yes ghandi is a jerk in the game

why is the dlc so expensive thanks sid fkn noob
recommended
ive been playing this game for like 15 hours now its actually pretty fun at first i was like whoa dude everyone is so addicted to this game called civ 5 and thought psshh they probably exaggerating but then i tried it out myself theres a lot of stuff to learn about it at first but once you learn all that in like an hour or two its all set sail from there it really reminds me of playing age of empires and red alert 1 back in the day brings back nostalgic memories this game is very deep like miley cyruss  you can easily sink in many many hours into it i would definitely rate this game a 9510 its like miley cyrus great visuals and very deep
recommended
really fun it just get better with friends online too perfect if you have the time for a good marathon game
recommended
awesome game be aware its addicting as hell
