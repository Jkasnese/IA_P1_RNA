this game gives me as much cancer as it gives me joy best sandbox game out there millions of possibilities turn your military simulator into a survival simulator or michael bay simulator or if your one of these people that is scared of daylight but you still want to get a small taste of how life is outside your trusty walls for you theres also city lifealtis life we they call it these days however to achieve fun in this one has to go through things like infinite loading times crashes crappy frames unless you have some 2000 pc and theres probably some more things that will make you ignite your computer and then yourself dont even get me started on the ai in this game tough when this game works like it should and does the things youd want it to do lol ye right it is defenitly worth your money

arma 3 has been a constantly evolving game definitely worth checking out now that its a more refined experience has tons of incredible user created scenarios a lot of variety online and finally the first part of the campaign is available this has been the most fun ive had in a shooter all year and i expect to continue enjoying it for years to come
recommended
definetly a stepup towards more realistic gameplay than cod and battlefield series steep learning curve with all sorts of options in how to affect your avatar in the environment  too many for most of us  so it really takes time to get into huge sandbox environments so plan on spending several hours in a match rather than your typical 20 minute arcadeshooter match some of the options and controls do feel a little clunky at the moment you do need a pretty decent rig to run on full graphic settings to get the most out of it challenging  very challenging great realism  it can be fustrating for new players so expect it going in

much better than that of the 2nd one less glitched a very polished look that really adds to the atmosphere

bohemia interactive have really created something special here top of the line military simulator an experience like no other for those unfamiliar with what a military simulator game entitles here is a few of the things you will be doing in altis and stratis the two maps in game which are ridiculously huge  gokarting  flying helicopters to the max height and then skydiving to your death  dealing drugs and becoming terrorists in altis life  having a great time attaching 50 cals to your gokart and killing your friends  great community workshop maps and missions such as the lost doge and skytrack 3000  having intense raves with glowsticks and coloured smoke the list goes on in conclusion buy this game
recommended
do it best decision you will ever make join a milsim community and enjoy the next 6 months of your life

i mostly bought this game to play altis life and have primarily done so but the single player campaign and other multiplayer options offer a lot of fun as well was definitely worth the cost and has been the only game ive been playing lately

arma 3 is a military sandbox from bohemia interactives i did not have the pleasure of joining the community until arma 3 was released but glad to have bought the game after highly rated reviews from the online community i have played the introductory showcases which shows you infantry armor and air elements of the games to get started the campaigns were also an interesting experience as well but lacked that live squad tactics that i desired consequently i transitioned towards multiplayer to see what it had to offer at the current time invade&annex capture the town objective breaking point zombie rpg atlis life rpg and wasteland dynamic missions and rpg remains the most popular maps on the servers invade&annex is probably the closest to a military element out of the 4 and the other four are probably experiences that can be better found in other titles a game model built in realism infantry tactics and armor assets should be better utilize than just simply playing rpgs in search of a more military experience i discovered endless survival whole lotta atlis and private gamemaster games more enriching i found some things that you cant simply experience on those common maps & servers mentioned in the previous paragraph when can you say that you were able to fly the a10c thunderbolt ii parachute into the ao next to your squad or evacuating out of a hot lz after protecting the president at the hospital these were just some of the satisfying environments in which i have played in in hopes of playing with more like minded fellas and pushing for milsim lets play im always glad to meet new friends strength and honor timh1203

great for people who like realism lots of realism groups for you to join to do this on a large scale it has a nice community and with the addition on zeus mode the game is pretty much an open sandbox world for mission creators to play with would definately reccomend picking this up

arma for me is one of those few games that you cant get into immediately you begin playing if youre like me you jump into multiplayer without any idea of what youre doing everything looks interesting but hyperrealistic immediately immersing you in the game you board a vehicle drive around for a little while thinking theres noone to fight straight before getting shot by an enemy you never saw your friend now joins and you both spawn but miles away from one another after walking for fifteen minutes you finally meet up mess around with the inventory system aquaint yourselves with most of the controls and head off on your adventure then you die it may sound like a rant on how unfair the game is but it seems to be a pretty common experience teamwork is essential in arma 3 with good communications helping such endeavours this makes for an experience of what real combat might be like without all the physical exertion finally you need patience for this game large maps with a small number of vehicles can make travel horrible if you get stranded if you like call of duty for its small maps and quick combat chances are you wont enjoy this fun but frustrating 710

this game is hella good you can go from helicopters jets boats submarines parachutes on foot you can do anything that you want freely the choice is up to you you want too explore you can but you always must use caution you never know ifwhen you will be shot at from any direction any height any distance and from any type of challenge wether its planes boats tanks mines enemies aka troops and paratroopers you name it you can also create missions for you and your friends to play you can also do anything set on your mind but you must follow server rules if you dont want too be kickedbanned you can also do solo missions the campaign training anything this game has a ton of mods so what are you waiting for buy now

ahhh arma 3 the third expansion of the arma series i love it and hate it at the same time at different moments the increased modding capabilities really made me really interested the main thing that really disappointed me was the lack of variety in the weapons and vehicle department they werent really unique but the gear system helped add more variety to the cosmetics of the characters but that doesnt really help due to the fact the weapons dont have much variety i love the arma 3 campaign not as personal and deep as the arma 2 campaign but still fun there are still soo many bugs that need fixing and optimization for multiplayer fps wise is very bad at the moment too i still give this game a 710 since it has many abilities from arma 2 and is still fun expect a lot of bugs though and a few random fps drops but that doesnt really effect the gameplay as much
recommended
the third game in the arma series brings the series to a new level the first thing i noticed was that the mouseacceleration from arma 2 was gone a welcome change to me and the physics system got a great overhaul from being nearly nothing arma 2 to be one of the best to date may get better when we get the full release the graphics are really good the textures are big and the shaders are gorgeous and best of all the bugsglitches are close to none the gameplay doesnt differ too much from the prequel though there are some improvments more positioning options prone lowcrouch crouch highcrouch etc and toggleable sights rds and scope of course there are many more but these are the ones that stand out from the previous game also worth to note is that the game is built upon teamwork in the multiplayer mode in othe words one does not simply walk into enemy territorium alone overall the game is really good even though its still in beta there are room for improvments and there has to be more content tanks jets etc but still i enjoy it as much as i enjoy arma 2 if not more final rating the alpha was a bit too buggy to be played 610 the beta feels much more reliable but we still need tanks  810 if it continues on the same path as right now the full realese will get a 1010 nothing to complain about its beta after all i just got one final word to say buy edit tanks etc are added but there are still some glitches that make the game unplayable at points but id still give it a 910
recommended
the level of fun and excitement ive had playing this game has not diminished a single bit since the day i first played it back in its alpha stage 1010

just two words must have

its the kind of game that if you like it enough you play it for hours but if you dont like it you play it a bit and then delete it i like it so ive played it for over 400 hours now i like it because in my opinion there is almost unlimited thigs to do campaign workshop missions around 300400 good ones high command mods zeus wasteland altis life king of the hill battleroyale maps your own scenarios that you can develop the game even helped me learn the basics of javascript

important expect a somewhat big learning kerb if your used to such shooters as bf and call of duty actually dont go into this game expecting the same type of game play as those games now if your still one of those people who think that arma 3 is just a graphics overhaul game your wrong i found i could never get into the base arma 2 game much with arma 3 theyve improved the overall smoothness of the game added bigger maps and my favourite the advanced stances ever played a fps and your running from some sniper fire and you see a rock and think its some good cover but once you get to it and crouch down your head ends up poking 4cms out over the top of the rock and you get your brains blown out by the  sniper well now you can just simple crouch just a bit more to the point where your guy is sitting down i highly recommend joining a clan for this game it is very much a multilayer game if this review helped and you ended up buying the game add me on steam and we can have a game

this is an interesting game it features a unique experience from milsim to even a life simulator it is a community driven and built game that allows community built missions modes and mods which makes it the ultimate sandbox for anyone my experiences come from a realism unit focusiong on usmc structure and we use mods for comms and weaponsvehicles my derp around screw around comes from mass server altis life and wasteland im also taking an introduction into coding and this game has opened me up to a world of creation of which can be shared by the click of the button to all of steam also this game has its issues its arma slang for this  is normal low scoring or reviewing this game is not logical or wellsupported play a game or two of arma 2 and tell me animationsphysicslightingmechanicsenginegraphicsrenderingease of use hasnt improved the game is a massive upgrade from its predecessors however lacking a lot of content and in the end is an excellent infantry simulator i gice the game a 1010 simply for its improvements and the abilities given to the community this game will surely grow to be greater then the developers could ever think to make it if it hasnt already

look at the amount of hours i have played and guess if i recommend it good military realism large map cant run and gun like cod almost everything about the game you can bedo pretty much anything in this game even a stupid mod thats highly popular called atlis life where you well live life as an avatar graphics are always a plus if your computer can run it bad even after a year of full release it still has glitches fatigue system is a pain in the  but realisticish its plain and simple if you love a legitimate military tactics movement feel over all then this game is for you the modding community is over the top and will release content for this till arma 5 comes out notice i skipped arma 4 thats how dedicated people are to these games if you like running and gunning youll rage quit within the first day highly recommended join us on eutw

i figured it was about time to right a review about this beautiful game first off this game in all actuality is more of a sandbox and a gaming platform with a military theme than it is anything else people will fanboy out and say that this is a hardcore military simulator bla bla bla but really it is what you make it and it depends on how you play and who your playing with for example like survival based games wasteland into roleplaying as police or rebels altis life like large scale team on team pvp king of the hill by samatra like the hardcore military aspect arma has to offer find a good tacsim clan and there are quite a few the thing about arma is it is designed as more of a platform for things to be developed on such as the mods that the wonderful community has designed in our clan we use quite a few mods ranging from sound mods that add more realistic and adrenaline pumping sound effects to weapon and vehicle packs to give us weapons used in real life by the military units that we essentially try to recreate the problem with some people is that they expect bohemia to add all of these features and what not such as a medical system or more realistic this and that but the problem is if they did things like that the entire community would be effected not just say the military simulator players of arma and at that not all clans wish to play the same way so if arma added say a much more realistic medical system some clans wouldnt like that and it may mess up there playstyle which is where mods come in so clans can adjust there gameplay to how they see fit overall this game is amazing i have spent many hours playing on our tactical realism server and i have spent many hours up all night with friends in skype and teamspeak on wasteland servers playing with extreme military tactics in a post apoc world gathering gear and taking out any and all contacts this game has the pontential to bring you hours upon hours of entertainment forget all the complaints of lack of this and needs more that bs this game can be what you make of it and most of us have chosen to enjoy it there are some amazing things being devoloped for this game such as the alive mod which adds a very realistic living breathing arma world where enemies have there own objectives and behave like real humans being controlled with real tactics and objectives in mind things like that make this game amazing and i expect to be playing it for many years to come ive been with it since the first month of alpha and it never ceases to get more and more amazing weather its updates to the engine or updates from the large and amazing community there is so much that i cant even begin to cover in this game but from the experienced i have had in this game it is easily my favorite game of all time even though it may have some querks here and there it is amazing  1010

arma 3 is a great military simulator which allows you to explore a very large map called altis and a smaller map called stratis with other players which leaves you fighting off the enemys who have control of the island just recently bohemia servers have shut down due to steam buying out the bohemia and for some unknown reason we arma 3 fans are still waiting for the servers to go online it has been almost 3 months now and still no sign of the servers this game is best when you are able to play with friends as i dont reccomend purchasing this game until bohemia interactive and steam sort out the server issues unfortunately arma 3 is going to be sitting in my steam library gathering cobwebs until the servers are back online
recommended
intense and enjoying game at the same time
recommended
this game blows me away more and more everytime i play and i cant get enough of it arma 3 has definitely made its way to being one of my favorite games and i highly recommend it to anyone whos even slightly interested you wont regret it 1010

simulation isnt the defining aspect of arma its scale the enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish bohemia interactives flagship franchise its what makes radios topographical maps binoculars and compasses practical equipment in an fps its what allows for kilometerlong headshots and coordinated convoy raids its what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemiesmuzzle flashes tracers gunsmokeas valuable as being a crack shot the scale of arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre including arma 2  altis  a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots is a mediterranean islandnation assembled from ruins airports coastal villages solar power plants military outposts salt flats and tankfriendly scrubland its a variegated backyard for you to play war in but whats more significant is that armas landscape finally has the technology it deserves arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series unbelievable dynamic lighting a volumetric cloud system genuine vehicle physics 3d weapon optics ragdoll noticeably improved weapon audio and other grainy eyelevel details await scrutiny inside arma 3s macro elegance the best improvement is the merciful cutting of arma 2s rigid tinmanwithoutoil combat animations which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands a halfyear in paid prerelease has given arma 3 time to gestate but the final build is far from being a comprehensive reinvention of the series and some longstanding blemishes that arise from its nature as a gargantuan simulation linger even on highend hardware my framerate dips under the spectacle of some multiplayer missions friendly ai units though marginally betterbehaved still depend on the player to be their brains an issue thats circumvented by playing arma the way god intended it cooperatively with voiceconnected friends and a good usercreated mission arma 3 is an unparalleled war story generator on operation fault line with a gang of steam pals i had to drive a clumsy eightwheeled transport called a hemtt across the map to protect this elephantine truck we had a ifv6c panther an apc with a mounted grenade launcher and 127mm mg minutes after leaving base our tanky bodyguard eats a land mine ruining its left track as we get out to survey the damage rockets streak across the valley everyones okay but the panther is immobilized dumping the apc is the only option we clump into the fragile hemtt burning diesel to get off the exposed ridge green tracers track the truck eventually pricking some of my tires the wheels dont deflate enough to go flat but the suspension slumps to the left for the rest of the mission i have to drive lopsided constantly countersteering just to keep the truck on the gravel road but everyone works together to keep our war bus on trackmy teammates give turn instructions read the map and scan the road for more mines when were free of immediate danger we send someone back to base to retrieve an atv so that we have a forward scouting element at one point we position two machinegunners with nightvision scopes at the lip of a valley to provide cover as we drive the hemtt down an exposed valley then taxi them back to us on the atv the sequence of events the chatter the wounds and kills we rack up all developed because we happened to run over a mine and our tires got shot up getting flexible armas capacity for stimulating camaraderie atmosphere and problemsolving in other words is fully intact the feeling of ownership that arises over these moments between you and your squadmates sticks in your brain central to this fun is how malleable arma continues to be for its community which before launch day had published almost 1500 missions to steam workshop  assuming you have an internet connection this well of content compensates for the absence of an official campaign at launch which will integrate in three free monthly installments beginning in october on the ground a new stance adjustments system is the best thing thats ever happened to infantry combat in arma holding the ctrl key as a modifier while tapping w or s cycles between nine vertical stances and you can also take a horizontal step in addition to using q or e to lean you feel articulatemaking small body adjustments while behind cover initially feels like finger gymnastics but the system makes more types of cover viable and more types of weapons viable in that cover coupled with the general smoothing of movement and the near elimination of arma 2s uninterruptible sluggish animations running and gunning should finally feel comfortable to average fps players on the opposite end of your gun though ai remains a shortcoming arma 3s enemies share plenty of their ancestors dna which means that they oscillate between being eagleeyed snipers at one moment and static dumb 3d silhouettes evocative of a light gun arcade game another their greatest flaw is that they lack personality which mostly resigns them to being targets rather than soldiers a few sparks of intelligence did impress meafter we killed the rest of his squadmates i watched a rifleman flee for the first time in arma setting up a tense shot where i had a narrow few seconds to snipe him in the back before he disappeared behind trees this is the sort of human behavior id love to see more of stuff like blindfiring limping throwing smoke grenades for cover claiming abandoned vehicles or looting bodies for suppliesanything that would lessen the predictability friendly ai is even worse unfortunately because theyre typically your responsibility its absurd that my squads medic wont patch me up when im bleeding right next to him unless i order him to pathfinding isnt reliable either i spent five minutes repeating the move to and get in vehicle commands trying to convince a freed hostage and my squadmate to cross the map so we could finish the mission they wouldnt budge the crux of the issue is armas milelong command menu which scatters dozens of commands across all 10 numerical keys like the enemy ai though there are glimpses of authentic behavior i felt like a proud parent when my ai fireteam unprompted broke formation and spread themselves behind cover during a raid on a cluttered factory breaking formation bohemias graphical improvements are substantial enough to make arma 3 one of the most visually impressive games on any platform altis and its littlebrother island stratis are rendered with incredible clarity illuminated by lighting that produces pink sunsets blinding solar glare and golden afternoons i love the way the earth feels textured as you jog and crawl through itgravel sand and grass all emit different sounds under your boots im mostly happy with the graphical performance ive been getting on the three configurations ive been playing arma 3 on the caveat being that my framerate varies based on where i am on the map the number of objects and enemies and if im playing online on a corei7 x990 at 347 ghz and two amd radeon 5970s on very high settings ive gotten 1725 fps on one singleplayer mission and 4050 on another multiplayer is where i found the leastconsistent performance on a corei7 870 and gtx 780 i can get 55 fps in a tight sixplayer scenario on very high but 20 in a largeformat mission like wasteland  tinkering with arma 3s 25 configurable video settings allowed me to improve these numbers a little but even dialing down the quality to standard or low on my rigs barely helped while playing large multiplayer missions the scripting or complexity of some scenarios simply seems to bottleneck performance regardless of your settings some specific actions also consistently produced framerate dips for me sorry ran out of words

its arma so i cant recommend it if you ever played arma withhout beeing a fanboy you know the flaws and bugs it has cause theyre still the same as in arma 2 and thats how easy it is

my favorite game since 2002 and it keeps getting better and better and better mostly thanks to bohemia interactive for making an open scripting command game then it was improved enormously by the community and their mods and missions third party softwares and blogsyoutubes in my opinion the acre mod made the immersion so intense that it became essential we now also have task force radio who is clearly 100% inspired from acre but they reacted faster to the porting to arma 3 probably because they are open source the ace guys made an amazing job at making better weapons ballistics medical etc etc etc now agm seems to be taking over that role in arma 3 another open source project also vts with its game master for real time mission creation and adapting which inspired the mcc makers and later zeus and finally play withsix previously known as six updater which made it so easy to bring all the community mods launchable and allowed us to create repositories for keeping up with updates and mod changes for long nights of great fun even though bi eventually took and implemented pretty much most of what i just described in the last paragraph it could only be made possible in the first place because how open this game was made by them what comes around goes around i guess and maybe that is why they are having the makearmanotwar contest where they are giving out some money i just hope that the original community innovators who actually made this game better get some creditprice imo bi started with an excellent idea with operation flashpoint they kept improving the engine over the years and the openness and the community is what made it what it is today my favorite game

best $60 i have spent on a game there is just so much you can do with arma right out of the package  king of the hill altis life wasteland etc then there are many options being created by community members in the form of modifications guns vehicles gamemodes if youre on the fence i suggest you just buy it there really is a community for just about everyone in arma

arma 3 is just great with the amount of customizable styles of gameplay anyone can play it with the oncoming marksman dlc along with the update there is even more customization if that isnt enough for you download mods unlike games like call of duty and the like that make you pay for character models or weapon camos in arma 3 you just download it yourself the mods can add any amount of uniforms or weapons or vehicles or nitty gritty details that people like me like to take note of arma 3 isnt all about streamlined gameplay sure you spawn in this invade and annex server where all of you get onto a blackfoot and fly towards the objective but there can be any other sort of factor that can either throw you off track orwell anything flying at 200mph and exploding upon contact rarely makes the situation better you may land safely or you may get shot down and go blackhawkdown style to the floor that in my opinion is one of the greatest things ever to be able to survive a helicopter crash and be all disoriented with bullets flying around and explosions all over even if the whole process repeats there is a chance something will change boom your combat life saver takes one in the face and dies your second combat life saver also gets owned your squad leader dies as well instead of reorganizing and heading to the objective your team has to run to the forests or the nearest thing that looks like cover to take a breather before moving on even then onout the situation is all different because your team is down by three and the odds have been shifted moral of the story your whole squad should be combat life savers

i am a army vet and have been longing for some military action for years since leaving the service i waited too long and should have played this sooner because it is almost everything i desire from a military simulator the other day i was thinking how great it is being back in the army without the disadvantages and useless activities that army life brings no drills no inspections and no hurry up and wait attitude and especially no getting yelled at because you missed a dust bunny in a corner behind a shelf somewhere first the bad unfortunately as good as this simulator is there is one major glaring problem which will make you pull out your hair constantly what im talking about here is the really dumb ai i am really not sure how the developers completely overlooked this aspect of the game the enemy ai is extremely stupid and has magic aimbotting skills one time i was doing some scenario and enemy troops have been called to the area to look for me so i was about 500 m away laying in prone position behind some rocks and looking at them with my binoculars watching their movements the ai looked like they where basically fighting their own coding they would walk then spin then fire a couple rounds at me and then continue walking rinse and repeat this till i finally left another time i was in prone position in a house on the second floor with no prior enemy contact all doors closed somehow the ai knew where i was laying on the floor and headshotted me with an m60 through the wall so far i have talked about the enemy ai but once you get control of a squad you will start screaming at your pixel friends and people in your house will think your ptsd is acting up again fear not we all have these outbursts playing with an ai squad in arma 3 they are simply the most useless squad members on the planet they act like if you actually took civilians off the street gave them a rifle and started throwing commands at them in a war zone they are clueless and useless the squad control ui is horrible and during heated exchanges you will be fumbling with numbers and f keys on your keyboard trying to give quick commands although are ai improvement mods which slightly fix the ai like asr ai 3 this will make the enemy ai slightly smarter but unfortunately the squad ai is still very boneheaded there is also the problem of glitches and bugs they occur often and sometimes completely break your game there are times where i had to restart a whole campaign because my inventory would stop working or again ai would not follow its coding and either get stuck or get into a car and proceed to run me over the worst are the ui bugs because they literally break your game and you usually have to restart the scenerio i have also had a couple crashes and game freezing issues the good now that we have that out of the way this is why this game is one of the best games i ever played personally i have been in the military for a couple years and know how things work this game is simply amazing although i havent played multiplayer yet waiting on my new mic i have watched videos of different scenarios and mods like altis life after playing arma 3 for 27 hours and playing user made scenarios like pilgrimage and whole lotta stratis with mods like tpw mods allintextures blastcore jsrs3 dragonfyre and some other mods i am simply blown away by this game the mods listed with whole lotta stratis will make your gameplay insane you are thrown into an all out war the first time i played it i was literally blown out of my seat from the sequence of events that fell before me i remember pausing the game sitting in disbelief on how amazing the game is this is just an example of my most recent in game events in the first 15 min of gameplay of whole lotta stratis this is as short as possible synopsis on what occured inserted in dinghy with 4 squad members during night time a see distant battle on land its pitch black and the only lights are near the shore where i see a little village and where my rebel contact is marked on the map even further i see lights glaring by as tracer rounds fly by explosions erupted and war rages on head to lz and talk to rebel contact get mission to cover lz from enemy so that a civilian can get extracted suddenly interrupted by explosions on the outside of the hut that i was in talking with rebel run out tell squad to take cover see enemy apache in the distance and its firing rockets at my parked dingy parked beside shore about 75m away hear explosions and run for cover behind some house while apache flies closer and hovers above us firing its machine gun then see the ghost hawk heli is flying over to pickup civilian for said extraction mission wondering how the hell will be cover the extraction point if there is an apache above us but its too late apache turns around and fires multiple rockets and shoots down the extraction heli we were waiting for i was confused on what to do no way of taking it out and started thinking that we will probably be dead any second now after literally 10 min of gameplay suddenly out of distance over the vast ocean horizon i see rockets flying towards the apache and it gets hit the apache turns around and tries flying away while failing to time its flare release then bam another rocket hits it apache goes behind some cliffs trying to emergency land but its too late as another rocket hits it and it explodes then i see my saviors as 2 friendly apaches fly by over a hilltop and zoom by towards another mountain i continue with my tasks and then hear huge explosions in the distance where a couple second ago my saviors where headed to i see flashes in the distance  i have other stories like getting for example hunted by a tank after i took out a patrol unit but they called for support before their demise in my profile i have a screenshot on how the tank almost ran over me when i was hiding from it laying in some bushes its pretty hilarious and was scary at the time this game is simply amazing and even though the ai is a massive almost game breaking con everything else is very good if you are a veteran and miss the good days of service go ahead and get this because you will be satisfied this is the best game i own on steam and in general get the mods get a mic for multiplayer and have a blast one thing to note is that i can see this game being not for everyone you do need to have patience because there is a major learning curve every key on the keyboard and mouse is used but once you have some basic commands down and learn to properly navigate in terrain while avoiding getting killed the game becomes challenging but fun when i started i was dying very quickly even with turned down difficulty now i simply allowed myself to raise the difficulty and even though i do die i feel like im surviving longer usually its my squad ai that screws me over anyway hope you enjoy the game as much as i am before purchasing i advise you to download the demo which can be found online and which will allow you to see if you want to learn how to play it

my story on arma 3 this was not made up i wrote this review for what it was likef or the first time before the war started i remember watching on tv where landing craft was landing on the beaches and men were getting killed i landed in the airport and i remember how people were signing up for the army i ran through the grass in california rushing to the airport to head to afghanstan after i landed we landed in europe somwhere it get us half an hour to get though training i fell asleep after a day i woke up hearing the transports going by of officers i got up and looked around i decided to go aboard my heilcopter i looked outside the driver closed the heilcopter down after my new sqaud got in i looked as we passed the terrain beatiful then we were going accross the sea i still had my pistol out and tried to quickly figure out where my gun was then i saw land the same land and beach i saw on tv we landed a mile or two away from the beach i didnt have time to figure out my equitment so i rushed with my sqaud my sqaud was getting ahead of me heilcopters and airplanes were everywhere above me i kept running my sqaud split up i kept falling my objective to follow my leader i looked ahead and saw fences and tons of troops i finally got my gun out and rushed accross grass and fences all of a suddden gunshots started to fire i didnt know where so i kept running a sharp pain in my hand and i dropped to the floor taking cover i kept crawling until my worst enemy was in front of me the fence i decided to get up and run i kept running until i reached the troops running in the dirt then my sqaudron started to move out to the town on my way i saw men surrounding a man the man was dead i heard gunshots all over again the man checked the boddy and the dead man got up the sniper was shot by his own teamate i rushed to where the sqaudron was and they healed the man appolgizeing i kept rushing through all of a sudden mission accpomplished men onto the next objective i lost my team everybody spreaded out a heilcopter was picking a man up i rushed to it and it took off without me i decided to head back to where i ran through the fences i kept running i noticed that i was thirsty i was tired i kept running trying to figure out my radio pressing buttons all over all of a sudden i pressed one button and talked into it hello hello this is robert this is my first time fighting and i need a medic i repeated the same sentence this time louder no reply came to me and i was worried i would die sweat came accross my face as i looked into a empety heilcopter i got in and he took me further into the fighting not back to hq i never knew when the battle was gonna be over i frogot my journal on the other heilcopter and noticed this heilocopter from hq the ride was longer we passed many farms in ruins and a city the heilcopter stopped and dropped me off alone another heilcopter came in and quickly a man jumped out of it i remember a attack heilcopter above me i ran to the village and was shot multiple times i turned quickly and got on the ground i was shot in the back i fell asleep i woke up back at hq wondering what was happening go go go a man shouted as cars passed by i was eager to get back into the chopper i got in and there was a bigger new sqaud in the heilcopter they wispered plans to eachother i started to write my first battle but time went by and everybody got out robert go go go the man shouted i got out and the heilcopter waited a second then lifted off the ground this time we landed in the same spot i stayed with my team this time but the same comamnder came on the radio great job you have taken the objective our team ran to the forest silently our sqaud commander took his binoculars and looked ahead retreat kept repeating on our radios a half an hour later armour was spotted and i  myself we were under fire and multiple jets were spotted a artillery shot fired and the civillian that came with us fell to the ground the marine got his saw and fired it we moved into the town and we thought the two heilcoptesrs were enemy heilcopters we got into one of the heilcopters and we waited for a long time for many people to get in ranger sqaud got in with snipers and a civillian got in we lifted off the ground and this time it felt alot more scarier all of a sudden while i was about to say somthing a huge hole went into the glass and hit the machine gun and almost killed the sniper bullets were everywhere and there were jets outside picking us off i wanted to get out but everything was down nobody moved and we were going on the heilcopter exploded and we all flew out a pack of us layed there i was gonna call for a medic but i couldnt reach it nobody could find us we were all lost all i could do was finish my story and await for sombody to find me thanks for reading this was my first time and im eager to do my 2nd adventure and then get some mods like the zombie mod and colonial mod

arma 3 the most universal shooter you might ever need to own back in the old days it was half life which everyone had to own because this piece had plenty of content which you were able to play in so many different ways that its almost impossible to count them all and arma nower days is pretty much the same even if youre not a fan of great and realistic combat simulations it offers massive free content via its big community which wont stop generating content until and after the next arma will be released but be aware this game is a hefty performance eater and it can cause you alot of headache because of its bugs but i have no doubt right now that most of the bugs are wiped out and the rest is still on its way to be fixed because this game really gets the love of its makers after its final release theres still an addon to be awaited as well as a very nice dlc and im positively looking forward to it

the most realistic shooter i have ever played it is not optimized very well especially if you are running older hardware but if you have a decent enough computer you will never forget the experiences this game will bring you my first day a3 i was on wasteland gametype just running around with my pistol out of nowhere a helicopter loaded with enemies was flying directly towards me and i decided it would be a good idea to shoot at drawing attention to myself turns out this was a good idea as the helicopter heads directly for me as if it was about to land ontop of my head instead it takes a nosedive into the ground killing everyone inside 1010 would shoot down choppers againwith a pistol

if you love arma 1 or any of its numerous iterations  spin offs andor if you love arma 2 do not purchase arma 3 it is a cash grab from the ground up i have no idea what happened to bohemia in the timespan between arma 2 and 3 but i suspect the immense wealth and popularity they gained from dayz really got to their heads featuring 90% less content than any previous iteration bohemia wants to give you the privelege of recreating  porting all the necessary content im talking very basic things here like planes vehicles weapons things bohemia legitimately removed in 3 from the previous games while offering you quality priced dlc like go karts if that kinda gimmicky dlc isnt your cup of tea dont worry bohemia has you covered upcoming dlc totes core improvements to the gameplay mechanics for things like bullet physics so you can pay for your patches now god bless bohemia

welcome to arma 3 you play as an american peace keeper with nato who has has gone through such intense training that he lacks the ability to run 5 metres without dying of what seems to be an asthma attack in this game you will be expected to kill people 500 metres away with a machine gun whilst smashing your forehead of its scope this is a coincidence as thats exactly what i was doing with my keyboard 5 minutes after starting the third mission due to losing my sanity prepare for the worst spent 15 hours of your life running across its terrible and repetetive terrain whilst being exploded into 5 million pieces by land mines that are impossible to see go ahead spend 40 pounds of your money to be dissapointed with the worst story i have ever seen in any game made in the history of pc good look you will need it 700010

tried it for the free weekend 1 hour to down load 15 min of playing and uninstalling from what i could see the graphics looked really nice across my triple setup and 5760x1080 was natievly supported so that is good too bad i had to uninstall it so fast and couldnt see more i hate being told on free weekend after i bothered downloading that you cant finish the game you need to buy it i wish they would tell me that first i could not zoom on the the equipped 10x zoom scope just fired blind at the 400m target in training until i hit it xbox 360 controller use could be better the language was terrible after the last fbomb which was still in just the training part i had enough and am uninstalling i know i have it before well that just adds to the realism that is how people talk well i am people and i was also in the military and that is not how i talk if you cant find more creative ways to expresive yourself than constantly using expletives it just shows your lack of maturity and brains this may very well be the best military game you play and you love it dearly but it is deinately not for me

one of the worst games ever the idea is kinda neat but the result  i hate the game the way it is the controls are overly complicated it literally uses all of the keyboard  this is ridiculous this is an fast pace action driven game you cant make something that uses so many keys without coursing trouble the game is hardly any optimized  i would allow this performance for a ea alpha game at best i have barely 30 frames  second when i turn everything down to oblivion  but my computer is totally idle when i crank everything up to maximum i only have 1015 frames but my computer is still bored then i only have peeks in my graphic card of 30% and 70% on my cpu cores the average however is 25% gpu and 50% cpu and i do have loooooots of empty ram even with all tricks in the forum applied which shouldnt be that case that you have to there is hardly any performance upgrade i do not have any sound either this is not my systems nor my fault but the games which refuses to output any the people can hear me though  which reminds me that the pushtotalk key gets notoriously stuck i have to press it several times to make it work and also several times to make it stop even though there is not pattern in it in occasions it works on first press or even like intended but this is rare this game is so bug ridden i cant even access the key binding settings  the game just freezes and the crash messages appears behind the game  so i have to randomly click on the middle of the screen for some time to find the close button which finally closes the game this game isnt ea or wasnt released just yesterday those problems and bugs should be gone by now but they arent so if you want to buy the game  dont do it  you will regret it

cannot invert y axis for controller there is an option to customize but you will have to remap the entire scheme because there are missingdouble binds im too old and set in my ways to change my ingrained play style for one game pulling back on the stick to look up is reflex for me
not recommended
its nothing but a thoroughly boring call of duty clone and by that think call of duty only more sluggish lesserquality graphics a tutorial that drags on and on and a weapons customization system ripped straight from battlefield i got this game for free and i want a refund on my time wasted playing it

wanted to like it tried to like it i just cant get into it or the arma 2 games too tedious and annoying all water under the bridge but i would like to have back all the money ive spent on the arma series
not recommended
not for me i regretfully spent $60 on this game because i like the dayz mod i know some people will say its a simulator but at the same time its a game and its not fun at all you randomly spawn always in a town by your lonesome you trek lightyears ahead to find any action or objective thats randomly changing but the moment you step out of your vehicle you get sniped from an army of dudes in the mountains rinse and repeat im normally a multiplayer first kind of guy but the campaignbootcamp is entertaining the game is also an insane rig to run without any framerate i shouldnt need to watch youtube videos to learn how to make the game run decent

nice game but waste of money disappointed

typical arma game  great potential and terrible execution the ai is either comically bad or super godlike with laser bullets squadmates dont do what you order them to they have a mind of their own and its quite pathetic random acts in the campaign make me shake with rage  i decided that i was not having fun playing this game and uninstalled its unfortunate because there is so much potential there but its held back by terrible ai questionable physics and horrendous mission designs in the single player campaigns
not recommended
ok ive been playing arma since ofp and even though i have played only 3 hours it sucks all the guys that love the arma feel and look throw it all away cause this is one big clust f the visuals are way too much and i feel that they over shot what they were going for dont get me wrong its a cool looky looky but hells no not going to recommend this game to anyone
not recommended
when you play multiplayer most people do no get over 60 frames per second 2040 fps is average i would suggest googling average fps arma 3 etc my pc easily meets the recommended game settings but after doing alot of research it seems like the game is not optimized and people are happy playing a game with low fps i play alot of first person shooter and fps makes a big difference so be carefull buying this game as i regret it
not recommended
sadly i have to not recomend this one so i got this game expecting hours of fun screwing around on servers which didnt disapoint however that being said it lacked in many areas for one the graphics had much to be desired and animations clipped horrificly no to mention the complexity of the controls its not a bad game but the graphics and such need to catch up to the content
not recommended
a more clumsy game is going to hard to find
not recommended
arma 3 had a horrible release it took about a year just to make it somewhat decent still not a great game arma 2 is still far better in my opinion
not recommended
my opinion about this game is that its bugged and people just camp worse than the camping in cod and bf i truly regret buying this game and i only bought it cause my friends say its great rubbish this game is no where near worth $60
not recommended
i bought this game and even till now i dont know how to use it idk wut i will do in multiplayer idk how to put things in inventory and how to respawn in a server last time i joined a server it was horriable it says you are dead wait a medic or wait to respawn  then i waited and waited 15 min nothhing happens wtf  why dont hey put a simple game that you can understand like bf4 cod ghosts or gta 5

unrealistic walked up behind someone unloaded an entire clip of an m4 into them 25 yards away with them not seeing me or even knowing im in the bush behind him he turns around and one shot me with a makarov just very unrealistic on the things that should be real and the things that doesnt matter they focus on

i want to recommend and enjoy this game but i dont because it is very buggy and feels poorly scripted sometimes something as fundamental as interacting with the world car doors ammo crates etc can be really awkward this can abruptly lead to your untimely poorly justified demise or if youre really unlucky youll lay around unconcious for 5 minutes prior to dying  i cant forgive the devs or the bugs in this game like a lot of people can it has been this way since arma 1  which i never played but understood it was unplayable arma 2 which i did play and found unplayable after two games i find arma 3 to be barely playable i figure by now they ought to know what they are doing and how to achieve a desired result niche game im sure theres a reason so many people love it i honestly feel as though im not patient enough to both play a simulator game and babysit the flaws of said game in order to get something out of it i havent exactly got a hardon for military games like others do either so bare in mind that your phallus may differ i would definitely change my review to recommend and play this game if it were just less buggy more playable it really doesnt matter if you add gokarts or dragons at this point just improve the game

game is ok and all but if you expect it to be realistic then you are wrong have fun emptying more than half of your mag into a guy 50m away and he lives
