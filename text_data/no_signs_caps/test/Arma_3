this game gives me as much cancer as it gives me joy best sandbox game out there millions of possibilities turn your military simulator into a survival simulator or michael bay simulator or if your one of these people that is scared of daylight but you still want to get a small taste of how life is outside your trusty walls for you theres also city lifealtis life we they call it these days however to achieve fun in this one has to go through things like infinite loading times crashes crappy frames unless you have some 2000 pc and theres probably some more things that will make you ignite your computer and then yourself dont even get me started on the ai in this game tough when this game works like it should and does the things youd want it to do lol ye right it is defenitly worth your money

arma 3 has been a constantly evolving game definitely worth checking out now that its a more refined experience has tons of incredible user created scenarios a lot of variety online and finally the first part of the campaign is available this has been the most fun ive had in a shooter all year and i expect to continue enjoying it for years to come
recommended
definetly a stepup towards more realistic gameplay than cod and battlefield series steep learning curve with all sorts of options in how to affect your avatar in the environment  too many for most of us  so it really takes time to get into huge sandbox environments so plan on spending several hours in a match rather than your typical 20 minute arcadeshooter match some of the options and controls do feel a little clunky at the moment you do need a pretty decent rig to run on full graphic settings to get the most out of it challenging  very challenging great realism  it can be fustrating for new players so expect it going in

much better than that of the 2nd one less glitched a very polished look that really adds to the atmosphere

bohemia interactive have really created something special here top of the line military simulator an experience like no other for those unfamiliar with what a military simulator game entitles here is a few of the things you will be doing in altis and stratis the two maps in game which are ridiculously huge  gokarting  flying helicopters to the max height and then skydiving to your death  dealing drugs and becoming terrorists in altis life  having a great time attaching 50 cals to your gokart and killing your friends  great community workshop maps and missions such as the lost doge and skytrack 3000  having intense raves with glowsticks and coloured smoke the list goes on in conclusion buy this game
recommended
do it best decision you will ever make join a milsim community and enjoy the next 6 months of your life

i mostly bought this game to play altis life and have primarily done so but the single player campaign and other multiplayer options offer a lot of fun as well was definitely worth the cost and has been the only game ive been playing lately

arma 3 is a military sandbox from bohemia interactives i did not have the pleasure of joining the community until arma 3 was released but glad to have bought the game after highly rated reviews from the online community i have played the introductory showcases which shows you infantry armor and air elements of the games to get started the campaigns were also an interesting experience as well but lacked that live squad tactics that i desired consequently i transitioned towards multiplayer to see what it had to offer at the current time invade&annex capture the town objective breaking point zombie rpg atlis life rpg and wasteland dynamic missions and rpg remains the most popular maps on the servers invade&annex is probably the closest to a military element out of the 4 and the other four are probably experiences that can be better found in other titles a game model built in realism infantry tactics and armor assets should be better utilize than just simply playing rpgs in search of a more military experience i discovered endless survival whole lotta atlis and private gamemaster games more enriching i found some things that you cant simply experience on those common maps & servers mentioned in the previous paragraph when can you say that you were able to fly the a10c thunderbolt ii parachute into the ao next to your squad or evacuating out of a hot lz after protecting the president at the hospital these were just some of the satisfying environments in which i have played in in hopes of playing with more like minded fellas and pushing for milsim lets play im always glad to meet new friends strength and honor timh1203

great for people who like realism lots of realism groups for you to join to do this on a large scale it has a nice community and with the addition on zeus mode the game is pretty much an open sandbox world for mission creators to play with would definately reccomend picking this up

arma for me is one of those few games that you cant get into immediately you begin playing if youre like me you jump into multiplayer without any idea of what youre doing everything looks interesting but hyperrealistic immediately immersing you in the game you board a vehicle drive around for a little while thinking theres noone to fight straight before getting shot by an enemy you never saw your friend now joins and you both spawn but miles away from one another after walking for fifteen minutes you finally meet up mess around with the inventory system aquaint yourselves with most of the controls and head off on your adventure then you die it may sound like a rant on how unfair the game is but it seems to be a pretty common experience teamwork is essential in arma 3 with good communications helping such endeavours this makes for an experience of what real combat might be like without all the physical exertion finally you need patience for this game large maps with a small number of vehicles can make travel horrible if you get stranded if you like call of duty for its small maps and quick combat chances are you wont enjoy this fun but frustrating 710

this game is hella good you can go from helicopters jets boats submarines parachutes on foot you can do anything that you want freely the choice is up to you you want too explore you can but you always must use caution you never know ifwhen you will be shot at from any direction any height any distance and from any type of challenge wether its planes boats tanks mines enemies aka troops and paratroopers you name it you can also create missions for you and your friends to play you can also do anything set on your mind but you must follow server rules if you dont want too be kickedbanned you can also do solo missions the campaign training anything this game has a ton of mods so what are you waiting for buy now

ahhh arma 3 the third expansion of the arma series i love it and hate it at the same time at different moments the increased modding capabilities really made me really interested the main thing that really disappointed me was the lack of variety in the weapons and vehicle department they werent really unique but the gear system helped add more variety to the cosmetics of the characters but that doesnt really help due to the fact the weapons dont have much variety i love the arma 3 campaign not as personal and deep as the arma 2 campaign but still fun there are still soo many bugs that need fixing and optimization for multiplayer fps wise is very bad at the moment too i still give this game a 710 since it has many abilities from arma 2 and is still fun expect a lot of bugs though and a few random fps drops but that doesnt really effect the gameplay as much
recommended
the third game in the arma series brings the series to a new level the first thing i noticed was that the mouseacceleration from arma 2 was gone a welcome change to me and the physics system got a great overhaul from being nearly nothing arma 2 to be one of the best to date may get better when we get the full release the graphics are really good the textures are big and the shaders are gorgeous and best of all the bugsglitches are close to none the gameplay doesnt differ too much from the prequel though there are some improvments more positioning options prone lowcrouch crouch highcrouch etc and toggleable sights rds and scope of course there are many more but these are the ones that stand out from the previous game also worth to note is that the game is built upon teamwork in the multiplayer mode in othe words one does not simply walk into enemy territorium alone overall the game is really good even though its still in beta there are room for improvments and there has to be more content tanks jets etc but still i enjoy it as much as i enjoy arma 2 if not more final rating the alpha was a bit too buggy to be played 610 the beta feels much more reliable but we still need tanks  810 if it continues on the same path as right now the full realese will get a 1010 nothing to complain about its beta after all i just got one final word to say buy edit tanks etc are added but there are still some glitches that make the game unplayable at points but id still give it a 910
recommended
the level of fun and excitement ive had playing this game has not diminished a single bit since the day i first played it back in its alpha stage 1010

just two words must have

its the kind of game that if you like it enough you play it for hours but if you dont like it you play it a bit and then delete it i like it so ive played it for over 400 hours now i like it because in my opinion there is almost unlimited thigs to do campaign workshop missions around 300400 good ones high command mods zeus wasteland altis life king of the hill battleroyale maps your own scenarios that you can develop the game even helped me learn the basics of javascript

important expect a somewhat big learning kerb if your used to such shooters as bf and call of duty actually dont go into this game expecting the same type of game play as those games now if your still one of those people who think that arma 3 is just a graphics overhaul game your wrong i found i could never get into the base arma 2 game much with arma 3 theyve improved the overall smoothness of the game added bigger maps and my favourite the advanced stances ever played a fps and your running from some sniper fire and you see a rock and think its some good cover but once you get to it and crouch down your head ends up poking 4cms out over the top of the rock and you get your brains blown out by the  sniper well now you can just simple crouch just a bit more to the point where your guy is sitting down i highly recommend joining a clan for this game it is very much a multilayer game if this review helped and you ended up buying the game add me on steam and we can have a game

this is an interesting game it features a unique experience from milsim to even a life simulator it is a community driven and built game that allows community built missions modes and mods which makes it the ultimate sandbox for anyone my experiences come from a realism unit focusiong on usmc structure and we use mods for comms and weaponsvehicles my derp around screw around comes from mass server altis life and wasteland im also taking an introduction into coding and this game has opened me up to a world of creation of which can be shared by the click of the button to all of steam also this game has its issues its arma slang for this  is normal low scoring or reviewing this game is not logical or wellsupported play a game or two of arma 2 and tell me animationsphysicslightingmechanicsenginegraphicsrenderingease of use hasnt improved the game is a massive upgrade from its predecessors however lacking a lot of content and in the end is an excellent infantry simulator i gice the game a 1010 simply for its improvements and the abilities given to the community this game will surely grow to be greater then the developers could ever think to make it if it hasnt already

look at the amount of hours i have played and guess if i recommend it good military realism large map cant run and gun like cod almost everything about the game you can bedo pretty much anything in this game even a stupid mod thats highly popular called atlis life where you well live life as an avatar graphics are always a plus if your computer can run it bad even after a year of full release it still has glitches fatigue system is a pain in the  but realisticish its plain and simple if you love a legitimate military tactics movement feel over all then this game is for you the modding community is over the top and will release content for this till arma 5 comes out notice i skipped arma 4 thats how dedicated people are to these games if you like running and gunning youll rage quit within the first day highly recommended join us on eutw

i figured it was about time to right a review about this beautiful game first off this game in all actuality is more of a sandbox and a gaming platform with a military theme than it is anything else people will fanboy out and say that this is a hardcore military simulator bla bla bla but really it is what you make it and it depends on how you play and who your playing with for example like survival based games wasteland into roleplaying as police or rebels altis life like large scale team on team pvp king of the hill by samatra like the hardcore military aspect arma has to offer find a good tacsim clan and there are quite a few the thing about arma is it is designed as more of a platform for things to be developed on such as the mods that the wonderful community has designed in our clan we use quite a few mods ranging from sound mods that add more realistic and adrenaline pumping sound effects to weapon and vehicle packs to give us weapons used in real life by the military units that we essentially try to recreate the problem with some people is that they expect bohemia to add all of these features and what not such as a medical system or more realistic this and that but the problem is if they did things like that the entire community would be effected not just say the military simulator players of arma and at that not all clans wish to play the same way so if arma added say a much more realistic medical system some clans wouldnt like that and it may mess up there playstyle which is where mods come in so clans can adjust there gameplay to how they see fit overall this game is amazing i have spent many hours playing on our tactical realism server and i have spent many hours up all night with friends in skype and teamspeak on wasteland servers playing with extreme military tactics in a post apoc world gathering gear and taking out any and all contacts this game has the pontential to bring you hours upon hours of entertainment forget all the complaints of lack of this and needs more that bs this game can be what you make of it and most of us have chosen to enjoy it there are some amazing things being devoloped for this game such as the alive mod which adds a very realistic living breathing arma world where enemies have there own objectives and behave like real humans being controlled with real tactics and objectives in mind things like that make this game amazing and i expect to be playing it for many years to come ive been with it since the first month of alpha and it never ceases to get more and more amazing weather its updates to the engine or updates from the large and amazing community there is so much that i cant even begin to cover in this game but from the experienced i have had in this game it is easily my favorite game of all time even though it may have some querks here and there it is amazing  1010

arma 3 is a great military simulator which allows you to explore a very large map called altis and a smaller map called stratis with other players which leaves you fighting off the enemys who have control of the island just recently bohemia servers have shut down due to steam buying out the bohemia and for some unknown reason we arma 3 fans are still waiting for the servers to go online it has been almost 3 months now and still no sign of the servers this game is best when you are able to play with friends as i dont reccomend purchasing this game until bohemia interactive and steam sort out the server issues unfortunately arma 3 is going to be sitting in my steam library gathering cobwebs until the servers are back online
recommended
intense and enjoying game at the same time
recommended
this game blows me away more and more everytime i play and i cant get enough of it arma 3 has definitely made its way to being one of my favorite games and i highly recommend it to anyone whos even slightly interested you wont regret it 1010

simulation isnt the defining aspect of arma its scale the enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish bohemia interactives flagship franchise its what makes radios topographical maps binoculars and compasses practical equipment in an fps its what allows for kilometerlong headshots and coordinated convoy raids its what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemiesmuzzle flashes tracers gunsmokeas valuable as being a crack shot the scale of arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre including arma 2  altis  a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots is a mediterranean islandnation assembled from ruins airports coastal villages solar power plants military outposts salt flats and tankfriendly scrubland its a variegated backyard for you to play war in but whats more significant is that armas landscape finally has the technology it deserves arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series unbelievable dynamic lighting a volumetric cloud system genuine vehicle physics 3d weapon optics ragdoll noticeably improved weapon audio and other grainy eyelevel details await scrutiny inside arma 3s macro elegance the best improvement is the merciful cutting of arma 2s rigid tinmanwithoutoil combat animations which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands a halfyear in paid prerelease has given arma 3 time to gestate but the final build is far from being a comprehensive reinvention of the series and some longstanding blemishes that arise from its nature as a gargantuan simulation linger even on highend hardware my framerate dips under the spectacle of some multiplayer missions friendly ai units though marginally betterbehaved still depend on the player to be their brains an issue thats circumvented by playing arma the way god intended it cooperatively with voiceconnected friends and a good usercreated mission arma 3 is an unparalleled war story generator on operation fault line with a gang of steam pals i had to drive a clumsy eightwheeled transport called a hemtt across the map to protect this elephantine truck we had a ifv6c panther an apc with a mounted grenade launcher and 127mm mg minutes after leaving base our tanky bodyguard eats a land mine ruining its left track as we get out to survey the damage rockets streak across the valley everyones okay but the panther is immobilized dumping the apc is the only option we clump into the fragile hemtt burning diesel to get off the exposed ridge green tracers track the truck eventually pricking some of my tires the wheels dont deflate enough to go flat but the suspension slumps to the left for the rest of the mission i have to drive lopsided constantly countersteering just to keep the truck on the gravel road but everyone works together to keep our war bus on trackmy teammates give turn instructions read the map and scan the road for more mines when were free of immediate danger we send someone back to base to retrieve an atv so that we have a forward scouting element at one point we position two machinegunners with nightvision scopes at the lip of a valley to provide cover as we drive the hemtt down an exposed valley then taxi them back to us on the atv the sequence of events the chatter the wounds and kills we rack up all developed because we happened to run over a mine and our tires got shot up getting flexible armas capacity for stimulating camaraderie atmosphere and problemsolving in other words is fully intact the feeling of ownership that arises over these moments between you and your squadmates sticks in your brain central to this fun is how malleable arma continues to be for its community which before launch day had published almost 1500 missions to steam workshop  assuming you have an internet connection this well of content compensates for the absence of an official campaign at launch which will integrate in three free monthly installments beginning in october on the ground a new stance adjustments system is the best thing thats ever happened to infantry combat in arma holding the ctrl key as a modifier while tapping w or s cycles between nine vertical stances and you can also take a horizontal step in addition to using q or e to lean you feel articulatemaking small body adjustments while behind cover initially feels like finger gymnastics but the system makes more types of cover viable and more types of weapons viable in that cover coupled with the general smoothing of movement and the near elimination of arma 2s uninterruptible sluggish animations running and gunning should finally feel comfortable to average fps players on the opposite end of your gun though ai remains a shortcoming arma 3s enemies share plenty of their ancestors dna which means that they oscillate between being eagleeyed snipers at one moment and static dumb 3d silhouettes evocative of a light gun arcade game another their greatest flaw is that they lack personality which mostly resigns them to being targets rather than soldiers a few sparks of intelligence did impress meafter we killed the rest of his squadmates i watched a rifleman flee for the first time in arma setting up a tense shot where i had a narrow few seconds to snipe him in the back before he disappeared behind trees this is the sort of human behavior id love to see more of stuff like blindfiring limping throwing smoke grenades for cover claiming abandoned vehicles or looting bodies for suppliesanything that would lessen the predictability friendly ai is even worse unfortunately because theyre typically your responsibility its absurd that my squads medic wont patch me up when im bleeding right next to him unless i order him to pathfinding isnt reliable either i spent five minutes repeating the move to and get in vehicle commands trying to convince a freed hostage and my squadmate to cross the map so we could finish the mission they wouldnt budge the crux of the issue is armas milelong command menu which scatters dozens of commands across all 10 numerical keys like the enemy ai though there are glimpses of authentic behavior i felt like a proud parent when my ai fireteam unprompted broke formation and spread themselves behind cover during a raid on a cluttered factory breaking formation bohemias graphical improvements are substantial enough to make arma 3 one of the most visually impressive games on any platform altis and its littlebrother island stratis are rendered with incredible clarity illuminated by lighting that produces pink sunsets blinding solar glare and golden afternoons i love the way the earth feels textured as you jog and crawl through itgravel sand and grass all emit different sounds under your boots im mostly happy with the graphical performance ive been getting on the three configurations ive been playing arma 3 on the caveat being that my framerate varies based on where i am on the map the number of objects and enemies and if im playing online on a corei7 x990 at 347 ghz and two amd radeon 5970s on very high settings ive gotten 1725 fps on one singleplayer mission and 4050 on another multiplayer is where i found the leastconsistent performance on a corei7 870 and gtx 780 i can get 55 fps in a tight sixplayer scenario on very high but 20 in a largeformat mission like wasteland  tinkering with arma 3s 25 configurable video settings allowed me to improve these numbers a little but even dialing down the quality to standard or low on my rigs barely helped while playing large multiplayer missions the scripting or complexity of some scenarios simply seems to bottleneck performance regardless of your settings some specific actions also consistently produced framerate dips for me sorry ran out of words

its arma so i cant recommend it if you ever played arma withhout beeing a fanboy you know the flaws and bugs it has cause theyre still the same as in arma 2 and thats how easy it is

my favorite game since 2002 and it keeps getting better and better and better mostly thanks to bohemia interactive for making an open scripting command game then it was improved enormously by the community and their mods and missions third party softwares and blogsyoutubes in my opinion the acre mod made the immersion so intense that it became essential we now also have task force radio who is clearly 100% inspired from acre but they reacted faster to the porting to arma 3 probably because they are open source the ace guys made an amazing job at making better weapons ballistics medical etc etc etc now agm seems to be taking over that role in arma 3 another open source project also vts with its game master for real time mission creation and adapting which inspired the mcc makers and later zeus and finally play withsix previously known as six updater which made it so easy to bring all the community mods launchable and allowed us to create repositories for keeping up with updates and mod changes for long nights of great fun even though bi eventually took and implemented pretty much most of what i just described in the last paragraph it could only be made possible in the first place because how open this game was made by them what comes around goes around i guess and maybe that is why they are having the makearmanotwar contest where they are giving out some money i just hope that the original community innovators who actually made this game better get some creditprice imo bi started with an excellent idea with operation flashpoint they kept improving the engine over the years and the openness and the community is what made it what it is today my favorite game

best $60 i have spent on a game there is just so much you can do with arma right out of the package  king of the hill altis life wasteland etc then there are many options being created by community members in the form of modifications guns vehicles gamemodes if youre on the fence i suggest you just buy it there really is a community for just about everyone in arma

arma 3 is just great with the amount of customizable styles of gameplay anyone can play it with the oncoming marksman dlc along with the update there is even more customization if that isnt enough for you download mods unlike games like call of duty and the like that make you pay for character models or weapon camos in arma 3 you just download it yourself the mods can add any amount of uniforms or weapons or vehicles or nitty gritty details that people like me like to take note of arma 3 isnt all about streamlined gameplay sure you spawn in this invade and annex server where all of you get onto a blackfoot and fly towards the objective but there can be any other sort of factor that can either throw you off track orwell anything flying at 200mph and exploding upon contact rarely makes the situation better you may land safely or you may get shot down and go blackhawkdown style to the floor that in my opinion is one of the greatest things ever to be able to survive a helicopter crash and be all disoriented with bullets flying around and explosions all over even if the whole process repeats there is a chance something will change boom your combat life saver takes one in the face and dies your second combat life saver also gets owned your squad leader dies as well instead of reorganizing and heading to the objective your team has to run to the forests or the nearest thing that looks like cover to take a breather before moving on even then onout the situation is all different because your team is down by three and the odds have been shifted moral of the story your whole squad should be combat life savers

i am a army vet and have been longing for some military action for years since leaving the service i waited too long and should have played this sooner because it is almost everything i desire from a military simulator the other day i was thinking how great it is being back in the army without the disadvantages and useless activities that army life brings no drills no inspections and no hurry up and wait attitude and especially no getting yelled at because you missed a dust bunny in a corner behind a shelf somewhere first the bad unfortunately as good as this simulator is there is one major glaring problem which will make you pull out your hair constantly what im talking about here is the really dumb ai i am really not sure how the developers completely overlooked this aspect of the game the enemy ai is extremely stupid and has magic aimbotting skills one time i was doing some scenario and enemy troops have been called to the area to look for me so i was about 500 m away laying in prone position behind some rocks and looking at them with my binoculars watching their movements the ai looked like they where basically fighting their own coding they would walk then spin then fire a couple rounds at me and then continue walking rinse and repeat this till i finally left another time i was in prone position in a house on the second floor with no prior enemy contact all doors closed somehow the ai knew where i was laying on the floor and headshotted me with an m60 through the wall so far i have talked about the enemy ai but once you get control of a squad you will start screaming at your pixel friends and people in your house will think your ptsd is acting up again fear not we all have these outbursts playing with an ai squad in arma 3 they are simply the most useless squad members on the planet they act like if you actually took civilians off the street gave them a rifle and started throwing commands at them in a war zone they are clueless and useless the squad control ui is horrible and during heated exchanges you will be fumbling with numbers and f keys on your keyboard trying to give quick commands although are ai improvement mods which slightly fix the ai like asr ai 3 this will make the enemy ai slightly smarter but unfortunately the squad ai is still very boneheaded there is also the problem of glitches and bugs they occur often and sometimes completely break your game there are times where i had to restart a whole campaign because my inventory would stop working or again ai would not follow its coding and either get stuck or get into a car and proceed to run me over the worst are the ui bugs because they literally break your game and you usually have to restart the scenerio i have also had a couple crashes and game freezing issues the good now that we have that out of the way this is why this game is one of the best games i ever played personally i have been in the military for a couple years and know how things work this game is simply amazing although i havent played multiplayer yet waiting on my new mic i have watched videos of different scenarios and mods like altis life after playing arma 3 for 27 hours and playing user made scenarios like pilgrimage and whole lotta stratis with mods like tpw mods allintextures blastcore jsrs3 dragonfyre and some other mods i am simply blown away by this game the mods listed with whole lotta stratis will make your gameplay insane you are thrown into an all out war the first time i played it i was literally blown out of my seat from the sequence of events that fell before me i remember pausing the game sitting in disbelief on how amazing the game is this is just an example of my most recent in game events in the first 15 min of gameplay of whole lotta stratis this is as short as possible synopsis on what occured inserted in dinghy with 4 squad members during night time a see distant battle on land its pitch black and the only lights are near the shore where i see a little village and where my rebel contact is marked on the map even further i see lights glaring by as tracer rounds fly by explosions erupted and war rages on head to lz and talk to rebel contact get mission to cover lz from enemy so that a civilian can get extracted suddenly interrupted by explosions on the outside of the hut that i was in talking with rebel run out tell squad to take cover see enemy apache in the distance and its firing rockets at my parked dingy parked beside shore about 75m away hear explosions and run for cover behind some house while apache flies closer and hovers above us firing its machine gun then see the ghost hawk heli is flying over to pickup civilian for said extraction mission wondering how the hell will be cover the extraction point if there is an apache above us but its too late apache turns around and fires multiple rockets and shoots down the extraction heli we were waiting for i was confused on what to do no way of taking it out and started thinking that we will probably be dead any second now after literally 10 min of gameplay suddenly out of distance over the vast ocean horizon i see rockets flying towards the apache and it gets hit the apache turns around and tries flying away while failing to time its flare release then bam another rocket hits it apache goes behind some cliffs trying to emergency land but its too late as another rocket hits it and it explodes then i see my saviors as 2 friendly apaches fly by over a hilltop and zoom by towards another mountain i continue with my tasks and then hear huge explosions in the distance where a couple second ago my saviors where headed to i see flashes in the distance  i have other stories like getting for example hunted by a tank after i took out a patrol unit but they called for support before their demise in my profile i have a screenshot on how the tank almost ran over me when i was hiding from it laying in some bushes its pretty hilarious and was scary at the time this game is simply amazing and even though the ai is a massive almost game breaking con everything else is very good if you are a veteran and miss the good days of service go ahead and get this because you will be satisfied this is the best game i own on steam and in general get the mods get a mic for multiplayer and have a blast one thing to note is that i can see this game being not for everyone you do need to have patience because there is a major learning curve every key on the keyboard and mouse is used but once you have some basic commands down and learn to properly navigate in terrain while avoiding getting killed the game becomes challenging but fun when i started i was dying very quickly even with turned down difficulty now i simply allowed myself to raise the difficulty and even though i do die i feel like im surviving longer usually its my squad ai that screws me over anyway hope you enjoy the game as much as i am before purchasing i advise you to download the demo which can be found online and which will allow you to see if you want to learn how to play it

my story on arma 3 this was not made up i wrote this review for what it was likef or the first time before the war started i remember watching on tv where landing craft was landing on the beaches and men were getting killed i landed in the airport and i remember how people were signing up for the army i ran through the grass in california rushing to the airport to head to afghanstan after i landed we landed in europe somwhere it get us half an hour to get though training i fell asleep after a day i woke up hearing the transports going by of officers i got up and looked around i decided to go aboard my heilcopter i looked outside the driver closed the heilcopter down after my new sqaud got in i looked as we passed the terrain beatiful then we were going accross the sea i still had my pistol out and tried to quickly figure out where my gun was then i saw land the same land and beach i saw on tv we landed a mile or two away from the beach i didnt have time to figure out my equitment so i rushed with my sqaud my sqaud was getting ahead of me heilcopters and airplanes were everywhere above me i kept running my sqaud split up i kept falling my objective to follow my leader i looked ahead and saw fences and tons of troops i finally got my gun out and rushed accross grass and fences all of a suddden gunshots started to fire i didnt know where so i kept running a sharp pain in my hand and i dropped to the floor taking cover i kept crawling until my worst enemy was in front of me the fence i decided to get up and run i kept running until i reached the troops running in the dirt then my sqaudron started to move out to the town on my way i saw men surrounding a man the man was dead i heard gunshots all over again the man checked the boddy and the dead man got up the sniper was shot by his own teamate i rushed to where the sqaudron was and they healed the man appolgizeing i kept rushing through all of a sudden mission accpomplished men onto the next objective i lost my team everybody spreaded out a heilcopter was picking a man up i rushed to it and it took off without me i decided to head back to where i ran through the fences i kept running i noticed that i was thirsty i was tired i kept running trying to figure out my radio pressing buttons all over all of a sudden i pressed one button and talked into it hello hello this is robert this is my first time fighting and i need a medic i repeated the same sentence this time louder no reply came to me and i was worried i would die sweat came accross my face as i looked into a empety heilcopter i got in and he took me further into the fighting not back to hq i never knew when the battle was gonna be over i frogot my journal on the other heilcopter and noticed this heilocopter from hq the ride was longer we passed many farms in ruins and a city the heilcopter stopped and dropped me off alone another heilcopter came in and quickly a man jumped out of it i remember a attack heilcopter above me i ran to the village and was shot multiple times i turned quickly and got on the ground i was shot in the back i fell asleep i woke up back at hq wondering what was happening go go go a man shouted as cars passed by i was eager to get back into the chopper i got in and there was a bigger new sqaud in the heilcopter they wispered plans to eachother i started to write my first battle but time went by and everybody got out robert go go go the man shouted i got out and the heilcopter waited a second then lifted off the ground this time we landed in the same spot i stayed with my team this time but the same comamnder came on the radio great job you have taken the objective our team ran to the forest silently our sqaud commander took his binoculars and looked ahead retreat kept repeating on our radios a half an hour later armour was spotted and i  myself we were under fire and multiple jets were spotted a artillery shot fired and the civillian that came with us fell to the ground the marine got his saw and fired it we moved into the town and we thought the two heilcoptesrs were enemy heilcopters we got into one of the heilcopters and we waited for a long time for many people to get in ranger sqaud got in with snipers and a civillian got in we lifted off the ground and this time it felt alot more scarier all of a sudden while i was about to say somthing a huge hole went into the glass and hit the machine gun and almost killed the sniper bullets were everywhere and there were jets outside picking us off i wanted to get out but everything was down nobody moved and we were going on the heilcopter exploded and we all flew out a pack of us layed there i was gonna call for a medic but i couldnt reach it nobody could find us we were all lost all i could do was finish my story and await for sombody to find me thanks for reading this was my first time and im eager to do my 2nd adventure and then get some mods like the zombie mod and colonial mod

arma 3 the most universal shooter you might ever need to own back in the old days it was half life which everyone had to own because this piece had plenty of content which you were able to play in so many different ways that its almost impossible to count them all and arma nower days is pretty much the same even if youre not a fan of great and realistic combat simulations it offers massive free content via its big community which wont stop generating content until and after the next arma will be released but be aware this game is a hefty performance eater and it can cause you alot of headache because of its bugs but i have no doubt right now that most of the bugs are wiped out and the rest is still on its way to be fixed because this game really gets the love of its makers after its final release theres still an addon to be awaited as well as a very nice dlc and im positively looking forward to it

the most realistic shooter i have ever played it is not optimized very well especially if you are running older hardware but if you have a decent enough computer you will never forget the experiences this game will bring you my first day a3 i was on wasteland gametype just running around with my pistol out of nowhere a helicopter loaded with enemies was flying directly towards me and i decided it would be a good idea to shoot at drawing attention to myself turns out this was a good idea as the helicopter heads directly for me as if it was about to land ontop of my head instead it takes a nosedive into the ground killing everyone inside 1010 would shoot down choppers againwith a pistol

i can highly reccomend this game if you are into any sort of simulators or realistic combat i have had extreme amounts of fun with all of the user created missions with or without friends i reccomend once you have purchased this game to follow these steps to have an early look at the zeus free dlc as it can add a whole extra level of enjoyment with the mission ever changing due to your actions in the state of mind of the dungeons and dragons role playing board game this is ow you can have early access to the dlc >purchase and download arma 3 >right click arma 3 in your steam library >click properties >up the top you will see a betas tab click it >the click the dropdown arrow next to opt out of all betas and change it so you are opted into the betas >click ok and return to your library you should see an update for arma 3 around 1gb >if not launch hte game the update should now start >once the update has finished launch arma 3 >from the main menu play multiplayer >from the server browser find any server that is marked with a [dev] tag this will be running the zeus dlc >play around on a couple servers find which one takes your fancy >enjoy that should be all i need to say oh have i told you to buy this game yet jus jus just do it take a leap of faith

i am truely amazed by how endless the possibilities are with arma 3 with the right mods or just the right friends you can make anything out of arma if you are looking to play i suggest you try out altis life if you like to roleplay recommended altis servers  black water gaming  the revolution gaming  black list gaming or perhaps you are looking to do some military type stuff then i suggest either find a milsim unit recommended military simulation units  40 commando 31186251180 ts ip or perhaps you are looking just to sit back and kill people for that i do not have any recommendations but look into king of the hill and wasteland

buying this game was probably one of my most amazing and worth while ideas i would like to thank psisyndicate httpswwwyoutubecomuserpsisyndicate and katt httpswwwyoutubecomchannelucwogxzyjhckcwxqynbhmosw for getting me into the game through their videos and streams now onto the review many people complain about the high price tag on arma 3 not including the dlc but i assure you it is worth every cent of it however if you cannot afford the game through steam you can pick it up from several diffrent websites for about 12 price i admitt the pricing is a little too steep if you include the dlc however searching around for the right price is as easy as 1 2 3 one other let down for arma 3 is if you dont have a gaming rig that you need a nice computer to even run it at low graphics at over 20fps multiplayer the reason this is such a let down is because with a lowend pc your render distance has to be lower if you want to run the game this is a huge disadvantage when you are facing people who have bigger pcs because they can see you before you see them although there are two upsides of having low graphics when i tested arma 3 in low graphics i found that since the render distance is lower the plants and bushes unrender sooner allowing the player to see people hiding in the bush very easily the other upside is that if you run it in low graphics you would have your shadows off this allows people who are hiding in the shadows be seen as if they were standing in the light this is probably my biggest issue with arma 3 because it creates unfair multiplayer gameplay however it does go both ways with advantages and disadvantages for both high and low graphics settings the high moddablity is a huge upside of arma 3 as it allows for endless fun and new things to try out at the current moment i am running 142 mods on my arma 3 with only a few minor bugs here and there but thats to be expected with that many mods another thing is the missions that members can create through the built in editor you can download many mission files for endless gameplay these missions can include heli races races combat missions skill building missions modded missions and many more the realism in the game ranging from the bullet drop bullet damage the ai and aircraft flight all of these and more if what creates an amazing game overall i recommend this game to anyone with the money and a pc that will be able to run the game with at least medium graphics running at 30fps or more

very fun game to play with some friends d
recommended
this game is horribly unoptimized very buggy and just plain doesnt work sometimes most mp servers are garbage and lag like hell the single player campain isnt very good and the vanilla game isnt worth anything near 60$ think of arma 3 as a foundation for things to be built on top of this game gets so much better with mods and other addons this game is without a doubt the best military simulator out right now and it gets many times better if you play with a group of people it has pretty much infinite replayability and more things to do than youll ever be able to it just has so much to offer and experience ive found that playing with a group of people in arma 3 is an amazing experience that no other shooter can offer arma 3 really is the ultimate sandbox in which the possibilites are endless if you can overlook its flaws and get over them youll find arma 3 to be one of the best games youve ever played

arma 3 is a tactical based military simulator with many features you can play alone or in a team its entirely up to you there are many servers that allow various gamemodes  even custom gamemodes and modservers the choice of many helos and vehicles of any kind make arma 3 immersive and realistic one of my favourite gamemodes is a roleplay based mode called altis life there are two main islands in arma 3 altis and stratis the goal of altis life is making money and interacting with other players you can also play as a cop or a medic and much more depending on your taste

i remember getting arma 2 on special back in the day played it once then put it on the shelf then i seen this mod called dayz and i have been sucked into the arma world ever since more to the point arma 3 a vast improvement on its predecessor but still a game that takes a lot of trial and error before you really get the hang of it and can appreciate the engine the single player campaign was slowly worked on and released over time with fixes and improvements over a period of time to end up with a really nice and although linear storyline they really add elements that allow you to verge away from the main storyline and engage in heaps of other tasks and activities  i had to play the main campaign twice to appreciate it the main reason to get arma 3 though is the mods from breaking point epoch to a heap of mission maps and game modes arma really throws a lot of diversity at you and is great bang for your buck

by far the most realistic military simulation game thats out today if youre a serious military enthusiast this is your game it also has the most impressive modding community ive ever seen for a game this is a true pc exclusive arma 3 is more than a military game if you are someone who is very creative and has a vision of an exciting scenario in your mind this game will give you the tools to make that vision come to life it does require a very powerful cpu to be clocked very high for it to run smoothly its rough around the edges but at the end of the day it gives you so much freedom that many games fail to deliver 910

arma 3 is an amazing military simulator game first person & third it offers an amazing experience from driving a tank to flying a gunship it offers a three part campaign survive adapt win which is made of between 2030 missions there is also a diverse community of clans military styled groups and even more there is also an option to play third person by pressing enter numpad but of course all keys can be reassigned this is an amazing game and i highly recommend you buy it

the best massively open world first and third person shooter i have every played arma 3 makes call of duty advanced warfare and battle field 4 look likes child play the amount of detail in all there helicopters tanks troop transports characters weapons maps lighting effects gocarts is overwhelming sometimes when im flying over a city getting ready to paradrop into a hell fire of tanks and jets i feel like im watching a hd action movie of the year i dont what i love most about this game the most might be laying in the grass on a hill a mile away from any conflict staring down my scope of my rifle calculating the wind and the bullet drop then taking the shot no game has every made me feel so rewarded when i complete a mission amra 3 missions are not these 5 minute deathmatches there long fought out high action battles also there map is so big its insane and its not just one island theres others that are insanely big i cant even imagine how long it would take to go from one side of the main island to the other flying in a helicopter going over 200 miles per hour lastly very unique complex nonrepetitive terrain love it care for it buy it

arma 3 is a great game but it is not for everyone  beautiful visuals that stay in the realm of the realistic alot of games that have been released lately are quite beautiful but many of the visuals in these games are overdone and embellished arma manages to retain its beauty while never really going over the edge into unrealistic gameplay depth if youve always wanted to experience real lifelike military combat then arma is for you combat in this game is slow tactile and unforgiving if you go into combat with a call of duty rambo one man army mentality you will die it is complex to the point of near ridiculousness with the game using nearly every key on the keyboard for keybinds real physics wind mapping realistic scope alignment and several other things that bring the game as close to real combat as most people would ever want to be  map size if you have never played an arma game before then youre in for something special this game boasts the biggest map of any game i think ive ever played coming in just shy of being twice the size of washington dc  steam workshop the game has full workshop support with everything from new character models to new missions i havent seen many guns or vehicles but im sure theyll come with time  accessibility as i said at the beginning of this review this game is by no means for everyone the amount of content is staggering for a new player and getting used to the controls can be a nightmare if youre not dedicated to the process  limited community as with every game there are good people and bad people in the community you will find several people that are willing to help you learn the game and you will find alot of people willing to have patience with you but with that being said arma has a really dedicated and hardcore fanbasecommunity you will get on servers where no one is going to help you you will get on servers where no one is going to pay any attention to you and you will get on servers where you are going to be yelled atshot at for not doing your part there are communities in this game that use real military tactics have a full chain of command and have real military training  performance this game is not easy to run i play on an intel i7 45ghz and an evga gtx670 4gb model and i have trouble maxing the game out in single player in multiplayer youll find yourself turning nearly everything to low just to squeeze every bit of performance out of your system that you can if you are not running top of the line tech i do not suggest playing this game you may end up disappointed  you make your own fun if you are not familiar with arma then you need to read up a little before your purchase this game does not have a full campaign yet and offers very little gameplay outside of multiplayer while the game does have and extensive scenario creator if you are not familiar with how to use this feature the game is going to seem completely barren in terms of gameplay it is very much so a bare bones package if you dont understand how to make scenarios however if you teach yourself how to do this the possibilities are virtually limitless  quite offputting to new players i remember my first few days of playing arma ii and i remember fairly vividly how much i hated them trying to take the game in is alot for a person who has been used to playing typical games all their life if you put alot of time into the game youll find enjoyment but its a bit of a rocky road at first overall arma iii is a great game that i personally love but i cant speak for everyone some will love this game and some will absolutely hate it it is a great game if you can manage to get past the steep learning curve when considering purchasing this game keep in mind that alot of people that give it bad reviews probably dont play games like this very often this is not battlefield and nor is it call of duty and thats okay it is its own genre and deserves to be treated as such 7910

shooting is as fun and precise as ever and alongside the abundance of gigantic explosions vehicle missions and intense firefights it feels like the closest thing most of us will ever get to starring in an action film in that sense arma iii is the classic call of duty formula at its best with an important defining difference the emphasis on drone warfare the exoticbutgrounded weaponry and the attention to detail in the believably hightech signage and architecture makes arma iii feel strikingly plausible even when it strays into nonhistorical settings a number of other smaller design tweaks highlight the clever design of class creation in arma iii for instance perks now only affect your character leaving it to the attachments system to affect your weapon thus if you want to do something like fast reload which will make longtime players look for the sleight of hand perk youll need to hook up your weapon with a fast clip attachment the kill streak system has also been wisely replaced by score streaks making every match less about how many kills and in what consecutive order you get them in and more about doing whatever nets you the highest score this accomplishes a majorly important feat it makes every game less about your kill  death ratio sure it still wont keep people from obsessing over it but if you want to get it higher youre going to need to help with objectives arma iiis zombies mode is the deepest the franchise has seen even if its campaign narrative is reliant on the selfimposed stories arising from your roaming zombieslaughtering adventures with pals the team at bi could have played it safe and arma iii would have sold well but instead they challenged assumptions and pushed the series forward in awesome new directions itll be hard to return to a campaign where i dont have the ability to shape it and i simply cant imagine going back to the old loadout system now that pick 10 exists combined with the host of subtle and overt improvements to the array of other systems the additions to make it more appealing to esports and the more fleshed out zombies mode this is not just a fantastic call of duty game but one of the best shooters of the last decade 93 amasing

amazing game and a great improvement from arma2 the controls are a bit confusing at first if youre used to arma2 but after getting used to them i noticed that arma3 has at least twice the fps of arma2 on my laptop and i have the graphics settings set to medhigh instead of lowmed as i did on arma2 still waiting for the modding community to become as active on this as it is on arma2

this is what battlefield 3 should have been before ea got thier nasty little hands on it this game is as close to the military as your gonna get without giving up your life for 4 or so years at least from a civilians point of view enough content to cover land sea and air and gives you way to many options to play the way you want to play for example i play intel style worth buying

arma 3 contrary to popular belief is a very good game it really just depends on who you are or who you play with if you spend your entire time playing arma 3 hoping to have an experience similar to dayz you wont have much fun what you really need to do is join servers that are running gamemodes such as domination and coordinate with your entire team keep in mind that arma 3 is nothing like battlefield or call of duty because you have to pay attention to the global picture of the entire map rather than just what you are currently aiming at you have to talk to your squad even if it is people you dont even know very well because everyone contributes to the well being of the squad all in all arma 3 is an extremely fun game as long as you play it correctly
recommended
as the 3rd installment to the arma series the quality that this game brings to the table is unpresidented in any other arma game with the rv4 it adds in directx 11 to bring stunning new visuals never seen before in the franchise the clunky mechanics from arma 2 have been reworked and are now fluid as ever in arma 3 although the game was rough at launch with performance the series of patches have vastly improved performance and by far is the smoothest arma to date multiplayer is better than ever with the new vehicles new guns overall id recommend this product to anyone who likes realistic shooters

through all the bugs and the quirks arma 3 really is a great game needs some more time to build the modding community back up from what it was in arma 2 though but it seems to be progressing well includes a great mission editor which allows infinite scenarios to be created

arma 3 feels like a step down compared to arma 2 with its smaller samey feeling arsenal that doesnt even include some short of shotgunyou heard me no shotguns and rather boring missions its poorly optimized and needs a lot of work to become a proper successor to its more entertaining and vastly superior predecessor recommended for arma fans that are far more hardcore than me who have probably already bought it for a finished game it sure is buggy  do you have a beefy pc but are still unable to run arma 3 with a consistent fps higher than 30 left click on arma 3 press properties click launch options and insert the following nosplash cpucount8 ultra if your cpu count is lower change it to 4 if you are still getting bad fps change ultra to high or very high running arma 3 on higher usually makes it run better then when its lower logic right i get 5070 frames very random

tldr game is slower paced but very good this game is the pinnacle of the military fps subgenre it literally does not get any better than this when it comes to realistic shooters do not go into the game expecting fast paced shooting like in most modern shooters expect to use tactics and work with your team to overcome enormous obstacles this is not for people who need to shoot something every 5 seconds most of the meat of the gameplay is in coordinating with your squadmates completing objectives and getting shots in from sometimes thousands of yards away every kill is a small victory in this game getting 8 kills during a multiplayer coop mission is something to be proud of depending on the mission the satifsfaction from eliminating enemies in this game is not one of i got a lot of kills but i helped my squad complete an objective personally i didnt like arma 2 because of how clunky it felt with both its inventory management and control but thats completely remedied in arma 3 movement feels responsive and the inventory is streamlined and easy to understand the developers are adding new features to this game for free constantly and workshop support  numerous mods ranging from full conversions to minor gameplay improvements ensure that there is no end to the amount of content you can download for this game on top of that at least from the people ive played with the community is stellar the fact that this is a hardcore shooter means that most of the kiddies who come from that game franchise get bored and leave immediately leaving only the dedicated whom are willing to learn and utilize the unique gameplay mechanics this has to be the first game where the times ive actually run into 12 year olds they were just as helpful attentive and cooperative as the average good player expect to walk for long periods of time before engaging in any actual firefight and expect to train yourself in single player before joining an online game i had to play httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid192094335&searchtexthelicoptertraining for a good four hours before i was comfortable with flying a heli let alone going into enemy lines with one even after im still a bit rusty but ill get better same with learning how to operate a sniper rifle which actually involves adjusting distance for your bullets to go where you want them to a mission i play often to train in sniping is httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid227323006&searchtextblueviper my gripes with the game extend to at times awful friendlyenemy ai really another thing is that this game could have benefitted from a demo or benchmark as the optimization is different than arma 2s and many i know are unsure if this game will run right on their lower end pcs the game could also do with an official mod manager that streamlines server mod downloads its easy to download missions but not mods youll be able to play on only very few servers since most run some mod like acre or a mod that one might have to go on a wild google chase to find edit workshop support has been added for mods instead of just campaigns one technical aspect i really appreciate is the fact that you dont have to manually forward any ports to host a server holy  only few have any idea how much of a pain in the  that is im glad that arma just lets you host a server for your buddies hassle free thank you bohemia edit since gamespy went down this is no longer the case and you need hamachi  all in all i recommend this game highly even at $60 which i will almost never do but this game is so fully featured and refreshing that i find it hard to tell you to wait for a sale but again i cannot stress enough that this game is for the team player and the highly attentive it is not for run and gunners or lone wolves movement is more likely to get you killed than save you most of the time ive only put in 25 or so hours so far but i see myself playing this game for a total of hundreds in the future

this game is addictive yet it has tons of bugs its fun if you are concerned that you wont like it try watching some altis life videos on youtube and buy the game when it is on summer or christmas sale on steam now lets get to what really matters there are two sides to this game there are the rp servers and then there are the milsims the rp roleplay servers are easy to get it deals with altis and turns your gaming experience into a life which then you have to develop your character and become friends or enemies with others you can mug kidnap and  if youre experienced other people this gamemode is for if you want to have some laughs and a  ton of fun if you are wanting the military simulator part of this gamemode then go check the millitary simulation servers there are fewer of them but they can be still be fun this gamemode provides a damn good simulation of war on altis ranging from hardcore strategies to commanding your troops this gamemode emits a real life enviroment for you to practice your gaming skills in thats all hope it helped by the way i reccomend this game a lot mostly for the people without large ing anger issues

this game is a pleasure to experience at times flying low over the island at sun up you notice how beautiful the graphics are whilst looking out the side window at the ground just whizzing past then you face inwards and look around you at your buddies who are chattering away about there lives outside the game then minutes later the pilot sets you down you all file out ready for whats next and everyone is quiet you tab to the edge of the ao and observe your objective what you see is small patrols with a couple of vehicles and a tank then you look past the area at the sun glistening off the sea in the distance then notice a spec flying towards you and an enemy cas warning pops up the heli you arrived in is shot out the sky and crashes a kilometer away all hell breaks loose while team leaders relay orders trying to bring control to the chaos but the plan has already gone to st you lay down suppresive fire then bound towards the town with your fireteam this game is a world apart sometimes its not like call of duty and not a whole lot like battlefield either this game will have you ducking for cover when you hear the shots crack overhead buy it play it and see how your story ends also i joined an altis life server filled with french people which i thought would be okay because i speak a little bit of french i was wrong it was a bad idea i approached a police officer making an arrest who immediately started screaming at me so loud i could not understand a word he was saying so i backed away turning to run and went around the block only to round a corner to see blue and red flashing lights screaming towards me before i could move he ran me over then seconds later i got an admin ban for being run over by an out of control police man now i live my altis life far from the law as possible on a different server thumbs up great game and community content will keep it alive for a long time to come definitly recommended

gameplay arma 3s gameplay is unique and realistic unlike call of duty and battlefield which dont get me wrong are great games in their own ways the controls can be quite hard to get used to in the arma series if your new this game does involve a steep learning curve but once youve learnt the controls youll be good at the game it takes time and thats why i think people hesistate to buy arma 3 or any arma game in general cause theres such a steep learning curve to it arma 3 is a great military simulator and simulates it very well graphics arma 3 has amazing graphics if you can run it on ultra and with fsaa and atoc oh yeah and dont forget to put sharpen filter on 100 otherwise youre game can and will look really blurry when running on ultra arma 3 will give you some fps drops every now and then especially when theres alot of ai and or players around maps and details arma 3 goes across two maps altis and stratis though the buildings are empty the map isnt designed to put objects in there only missions do though it does reduce lag when playing around in the editor other than that the maps are great and i love to play on both of them community arma 3 has one of the best and most helpful communities ive have ever seen though the modding community is all over the place and not all mods are compatible very rarely do you get hackers on arma 3 because its not a really popular game amongst hackers unlike call of duty or battlefield developers arma 3 has a dev team that still develops the game regardless of the haters they have developed this game for over 2 years now and its just amazing how much content theyve added since then like weapon resting shooting from the back of cars and helicopters bipods and alot more they are one of the best dev teams ive come across and hope they dont abandon arma 3s development downloadable content bohemia interactive have released three dlcs so far karts helicopters and marksmen dlcs and alot of free platform updates but some think its way to expensive for two helicopters but they put alot of effort in the helicopters dlc to make sure its working proply before we get our hands on it  a platform update also gets released with every dlc d overall overall i think the game is great and for 6000 aud i think it is the best money ive spent on games in my whole life so i recommend you buy this game just go buy it now i tell you now final rating  1010 rubixpieguy approved

tldr is at the bottom ahh who remembers good old operation flashpoint not that crap modern sheit but bis operation flashpoint there are some that dont know that arma is its direct ancestor btw anyways when i was young too young for the game ill bet oooo edgy i sank a good few thousand hours into ofp cold war crisis and its expansions eventually i played arma 2 i wasnt really very impressed due to the crashes and the actual graphical look of the game was horrible some sorta film grain gone wrong then the recent free weekend rolled around for arma 3 i was so impressed that i had to buy myself a 95 headset  and that was the cheapest price for it id probably have a few more 10s of hours in the game but its the studying time of the year but this game sure it has a weird looking stealthinspired vehicles but its arma its moddable and bi encourage you to mod unlike almost every other company that means you get things like iron front an arma 2 mod turned into a full game turned into an arma 3 mod confusing i know that features wwii campaigns with maps and units to play with in the editor it means you get jsrs a sound mod that changes so many sounds in the game  the one i notice the most is the jets the jets sound real and when you wear a surround sound headset or have surround speakers it sounds real makes me feel like im in the lake district for some reason the raf does training there and then theres the multiplayer im not even going to go further than saying the best servers are the 77th jsoc coop eu1 and eu2 unless youre murican if youre murican you lag go away if youre a kid dont even touch my favourite servers if youre looking for a group that actually plays together as a team go no further than the 77th the rest of the coop servers cant actually work coop if they got paid to do it idk even know why im writing a review i just wanted to tell you about the best server on arma and that altislife sheeit is for kids who shouldnt even be playing the game you want to roleplay go play  gmod anyway everyone tells a funny story so this one time on 77th its late night irl its dark ingame too barely anyone is online so im leading a squad and we are driving from the airport to the ao south east of pygros in a hemtt transport it takes so long the squad in the back starts shooting rabbits from the back and talking about stuff soldiers talk about idk half an hour later literally we are nearly there i cant see the ao but its just over a hill in front of us then theres a sound and then another sound like a rocket so yeah a jet comes out of nowhere entire squad leaves and im left on my own in base 1010 tldr ofp cwc is arma arma 2 had a bad film grain effect arma 3 free weekend got headphones mods like iron front and jsrs raf does training in the lake district 77th jsoc owns the best 2 servers in the game  americans and squeekers stay out altislife is for kids that should go back to gmod and finally i drive a hemtt transport full of soldiers to their death by jet arma 3 1010 not ign has enough water

arma 3 is a war simulator unlike anything you must have ever seen it develops the arma legacy even further if youve only played fps shooters like call of duty battlefield crysis and the like then youve been living under a rock all this while youve let the class of war simulators completely pass you by in a nutshell arma 3 is an open world war scenario with two intricately detailed maps featuring places for all kinds of warfare whether your choice is to wage war in the complex blocks in kavala on a sunny morning or you choose to dive in and assault a coastline on a cloudy night at 11 pm arma 3 is a thing for everyone anything in real life combat can be done here arma 3 has unprecedented levels of sandbox freedom allowing you to script and create complex scenarios in and outside the editor arma 3 lets you customize your weapons extensively choose your ammunition gun and attachments and go out on the field to decimate your enemies accurately designed ballistics ensure you always have a winning edge on your enemies so what do you wait for strike hard strike fast

spending enough time in this game to fully appreciate the good and the bad i have decided to put some words down i love this game more than any other game that comes to mind where do i start ill start with the hard stuff you will stuggle with this game you will have moments where you hate the way its coded you will die to stupid things like stairs or rocks you will hate the fatigue system and the weapon sway you will get annoyed at the reskins for outfits eventually you will mod it this is not a simple run and gun game you will not find yourself no scoping after sprinting for 2 kliks arma 3 is a simulator first and a game second the groundwork is solid for the most part the modding community is devoted the game modes are varied there is something that almost everyone will find appealing inside this package halo jumping dressed like the uk special forces check thank a modder driving a hatchback thats colored like the american flag check thank a modder want to build a mission around the tet offensive check thank a modder am i biased yes do i have a huge amount of respect for modders yes arma 3 is a cpu intensive game you will have to tweek the hell out of it to make it just right you arent going to get 60 fps on poorly coded mp servers please dont think its your hardware its not well probably not but this game really shines in the graphic department once shes setup just right im constantly trying to squeeze as much performance as possible but im not going to go over everything ive done it would take too long if you google it you will find it playing the game by yourself is hindering your fun to an extent i cant even explain ok since you asked so nicely ill try playing to campaign alone left me yearning for more i really disliked the interface when assigning targets or handing out orders to the ai squadmates i had been shackled with it doesnt feel very fluid nor does it give me the feeling of teamwork the ai at times can go full  and just stand there while being mowed down by the enemy forces you may order them to get into the truck youre sitting in only to find one of them has the great idea to run right into the ao and alert everyone to your presence ok i guess stealth is off the table at least i have superior numbers ha they wont get out of the truck and that rpg is headed this way ill just reload my save then now replay that with real people that communicate and know how to play completely different outcome im not typing that hypothetical situation out again just trust me now onto the really fun part that part that makes my genitals tingle the mods omg becky look at those mods theyre so big no they arent all large downloads even some of the smallest mods can change the game to a large extent take agm for example it has different frag throwing options a medical system that includes epis blood bags adrenaline and the ability to drag people to safety no longer can you see how many rounds are left in your mag you can only see the weight it has weapon resting fast roping cook offs vehicle repair options and a bunch of other things i cant think off what about vehicles i really like the hummvees from arma 2 there are a few different options for mods for that do you hate that you stop moving when you switch weapons theres a mod for that tactical glasses have no use in the game theres a mod that gives you a hud when wearing the glasses in first person i hate the stock sounds jsrs3 baby want a canadian mohawk reskin mod tired of playing altis or stratis bornholm tilos chernobyl chernarus utes panthera just to name a few of the many user made maps available with a few clicks be warned mods dont always work right out of the box if you dont have patience youre just going to have a bad time sometimes mods dont work well with each other or give you graphical errors or arent compatible with user made missons in short when they work oh baby do they when they dont you deal with it or stop using them look im biased i really am i love the milsim aspect of this game i love the squad play i love the vehicles and the guns i love the guys i play with they say that the best things in life are the things you have to work for thats what arma 3 is you have to work for it but it really shines in the long run

very great update compared to arma2
recommended
this is a great millitary simulator and takes a special type of player to play it has a great modding community and most content from the previous games can be used in this one if you own them try the demo of arma ii because this is very similar except for the updated engine do not expect this to be call of duty they are not comparable it is a millitary simulator that requires teamwork and leadership to become successful at i believe this is the best millitary simulator on the market to date
recommended
just wow there is so muuuch to discover in this game unlimited potential to rpg gaming i really enjoy altis life  hope there will be much more added so i dont need to go outside anymore and can do all my stuff inside my second life in altis
recommended
mechanically arma 3 is outstanding with controls that are smooth while still portraying the weight of a human body weapons feel great and firefights remain intense both against ai and other humas atlis is an impressive map with each square kilometer offering interesting options for firefights the first two episodes of the campaign are good and there are some great mods and modes already showing up like breaking point and the universal war sandbox it also happens to be the best looking open world game around in terms of sheer realism im genuinely excited to see how this game develops in the coming years
recommended
revised review being a veteran myself i can honestly say that arma 3 is probably the closest you will get to an accurate military simulator on the combat side massive battles that are done tactically using infilitration parachuting convoys or simply being flown in by another player on a blackhawk this is war the first thing im gonna get out of the way is the only bad thing i can think of framerate i have a decent computer myself but still suffer from 2030 fps at best its not terrible but can become frusterating the graphics of the game are well done nothing insane here but for how large the maps are the terrain vehicle character and weapon models are all done very well animations are pretty smooth for the most part and weapon models are accurate to their real life counterparts audio in the game is great helicopters can be heard even when they cant be seen gunfire echos through the streets and tanks can be heard rumbling their way through the hills the gameplay is where arma shines there is virtually unlimited possibilities to what you can do since the game has mod support there is an astounding number of weapons and vehicles in the game and the amount of control you get over them is fantastic multiple game modes such as wasteland similar to the dayz mod rpg you earn money for new weapons deathmatches and large scale warfare on giant maps with multiple objectives many other game modes exist and some are really great join in squads with your friends and have a role for each of you then attempt to escape the island while enemy forces hunt you down arma really brings excitement when it comes to firefights with accurate bullet drops and mechanics making some fights last awhile or some simply be over in seconds the campaign is interesting and will keep you entertained for hours alone then you can jump into the vast amount of multiplayer options altogether this game is a must have for any military arma series or shooter fans

edit serious review this game is currently the best sandbox military simulator pros  amazing graphics  amazing gameplay  supports mods which is all about this game modders does great stuff  great fun with friends  constantly being updated cons  desync issues  lag issues when theres alot of people in one server
recommended
finally a game that is not casual targetandshoot in arma you first have to plan your mission and then 95% of the time run around but that feeling when running to an op taking position knowing that you are gonna open fire soonjust awesome as in the old armas you get a lot of online mods but also a very complicated control system and not much for your hardware but i mean it still looks very well on a midend pc also it is cool that vehicels are powered rightly some a bit op bohemsia keeps patching so and that you can discover the whole huge map so i would say definitly buy if you are clear that this is a simulation not just a battlefield or cod
recommended
if arma 4 does not come out i will slit your mother

youd think this game would be amazing but it is buy it and give it all your money now you ing losers what are you doing with your lives you ing  ups 1010 its alright
recommended
60 fps on singleplayer 10 fps on multiplayer 1010 i ing love it
recommended
cod players our game is very tactical while screaming 360 no scope battlefield players phuh our game is very realistic with big maps while jumping out of a jet to pistol down another jet me in arma after sneaking around for 15min i got shot while hiding behind a bush when i met my first enemy for the 20th time and i love it keeps me from signing up in the military i cant spend 45 eurodollar on a single game and i wont spend it on this game but in contrast to most games this game is really worth it if you have the money pro extreme modding toolseditor  many mods campaign is the realism i have been looking for subjective vast visual improvement versus arma2 and ran very well with me much better controls versus arma2 zeus is a vast content addition for strategy lovers perfect for lan parties huge amount of content con nitpicking armory where is it nvidia physx sorry amd lacking fully destructible environment sometimes horrendous multiplayer community vehicle physics still need improvement call me annoying but this game needs many more vehicles action menu still needs improvement multiplayer can be very laggy arma without bugs is not arma noob unfriendly uicontrols etc or is that a pro
recommended
you should get this game its awesome and realistic
recommended
awesome game for what it is designed for arma is a military simulator and that brings good and bad things you cant go guns blazing everywhere like you would in cod get shot 23 times youre dead thats it your tank gets hit by a single missile youre dead you get sniped from a mile away by someone hiding in the bushes youre dead this game aims for realism and it definitely achieves that buy this game knowing that it is very different than typical fps shooters but it is so much better in so many ways the tactical abilities of your soldier the controls to move your soldier the gameplay with your friends and the mods that are created are amazing the mods seriously make this game come alive this is a great game different from other shooters because its in its own category
recommended
i only played a little bit made my own planes helicopters and stuff p

good game overall

really good game i got addicted as soon as i started to play altis life and stratis wasteland i just cant stop playing it now
recommended
its just awesome
recommended
this is a high quality sandbox game it has everything to be unique it has a huge map and another very large to you can do squad missions be the leader or to be a soldier and a squad member this game is very interesting and it has vehicles which are very fun to ride the combat is very interesting and sometimes difficult if you want a game like counter strike or call of duty then go somewhere els everyone must have writen that but i will write it to the graphics are awesome sometime it feels real so better have a computer that can run this cause i only have the minimum and i really like the game if you reach max running then there is no bound to how much you will love the game you can check if you can run the game athttpsystemrequirementslabcomcyri single player is interesting and nice but the multiplayer is the real deal you have a lot of servers with diffrent rules and attributes you can drive with some people around the world and survive and you can go to the missions that the server gives you randomaly for ending i really love the game and i want you will to so if you dont want to spend 60$ then wait for a good sale
recommended
the multiplayer mods for this are the best
recommended
this game is amazing i was worried that i would have bought a bad game for how much it cost but it was really worth every penny out of 10 stars i would give it a 95 and the only reason its not 1010 i sbecuase at first when i started playing it i had extremly low fps and i know i have a very good rig becuase i built it myself so i spent a couple of days trying to figure out what was wrong and frustration everywhere after a while i set the games priority to high in the luanch options and some other tweaks to the game thankfully im experienced with computer hardware but other people with no experience might have alot of trouble with it hopefully you guy scan fix that in some way other than that this game is 10 out of 10 would definitely recommend to anyone i just finished playing it and i started today yeah 7 hours d i had a blast and i will tomorrow too
recommended
fantastic game it really does need some patches more weapons and animation fixes especially with reloading but other than that if you love extremely hardcore games and only hardcore games this game will be bad if your going to play it like cod or bf then this is the game for you considering the state that its in id give it an 8510  but when the devs fix the glitches and animations this game will easily score at least a 9510 for a military simulation it has a very steep learning curve but in 5 hours or so you should get the hang of it d

not for the light hearted if youre looking for an easy gameshooter this is not the one for you arma iii incorporates aesthetically realistic and functionally sound elements which require not only multifaceted operation but also reticulated execution as such arma iii caters to the serious gamers who adhere well to solidarity in teamwork and efficacy in realistic measures with various elements in play such as air support in many forms ground armour and true ballistics one needs to be on their top game to prosper in the battlefield of arma 3
recommended
do you like tactics do you like explosions do you like tanks and explosions with tactics do you like uavs with explosions with a convoy with tanks and explosions and amphibious apcs with tactics then you need this game
recommended
do you want to die a lot good cuz you will
recommended
arma 3 is an amazing game they started off with quite a few problems but have worked a lot of them out the dif mods and the zeus portion of the game gives you an awesome chance at making the game you want it to be as well i would recommend 1010
recommended
if you are a fan of games that involve warfare and fps i strongly reccomend this game ill assume that youre not an arma veteran becuase if you are you dont need to read reviews to know this is a good gam simulator war simulator good and bad side it is very hard to learn its good because its a simulator not a game and war is not easy as cod would suggest and its bad because youre going to die a lot good side it is higly entertaining and challenging the developers worried about things like fatigue and shooting stances and its effects on accuracy bad side tutorials could be better squad commanding engine is clunky at best your units will present the bug where they no longer move wuite often forcing you to continue alone against what you fight with a squad or loading the game to its last saved point what can really  you off but the goos outweight the bad 8010

great game

this is a huge improvement over arma 2 the visuals the gameplay everything is better theres a considerable amount of mods for this already and the ingame editor is great for making your own missions i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great military simulatorsandbox

nice if u want to play mods
recommended
great game
recommended
having owned this since the alpha i can say i highly recommend it this beautiful game brings not only fantastic single and multiplayer modes but stunning graphics as well it has a much better optimization than arma 2 but is also more graphically intensive due to being a newer game modding community is very developed and mods are plentiful breaking point mod highly recomended for those who enjoy dayz all together an amazing game and a huge stepup from arma 2

recommended
the possibilities are endless d seriously this game can do pretty much anything if you know how
recommended
while i do recommend this game its only thanks to armas modding community and well in advance because while there already are some very good mods and missions for arma 3 the vast majority of them simply is additional content ported over from arma 2 as for the game itself in its vanilla form thumbs down bad net code bad design awful singleplayer campaign terrible bugs like ai twitching when you hit them with your fire technologically arma 3 is stuck in 2009 graphics dont age well it already looks outdated while being very demanding resource wise  bad optimization unfortunately arma 3 doesnt have any competition in simulating combined arms warfare while every aspect of arma 3 is done poorly its the only game that comes with all of it in one package

fun great community plenty of mods to keep you entertained but this game is expensive its a stretch whether its worth 60$ imo but its very fun would buy again if it got cheaper
recommended
arma 3 is a fun game to play with your friends and offline the offline story is very god and its always action if you thinking of buying it i just say do it its worth it but 1thing dont stop playing it in the beginig couse its hard just restart and try a new tactic sry for the not so good english buy it

this game has even more potential than it has this offers all kinds of modes for different types of players arma 3 is the best shootinginteractive game in quite a long time keep up the good work
recommended
ahh arma 3 god what a fantastice game now this game i would rate it a 710 why you may ask heres the reason this game is open world amazing physics can be a little wonky but it gives you such a realistic feeling its amazing want to play with zombies go for it in development but hey it still counts want to roleplay with your friends tons of servers waiting for you while this game isnt exactly optimized for pc in the best way fps drops random crashes high ping it is still one hell of a game go buy it now
recommended
cool beanz
recommended
a military shooter that while being mediocre on its own has fantastic playercreated content that makes this game a blast to play with friends but still fun to play solo
recommended
this gream is great ive been in the arma community for 2 years now and i have to say this game still amazed me theres so much to learn and so much that you can do with it this game is for anyone who is willing to give away hours and hours of their life to play this game
recommended
yes its amazing

u kill people and they kill u back its really the essence of life itself meaningful
recommended
this game is just epic just a epic war with so many mods weapons and vehicles the graphics are awesome and you can play with friends and make fun
recommended
lets start off by saying that this game is great totaly worth all the money now this games does have its flaws the controls are hard to get used to almost every key on the keyboard is used for something or multiple things also the game engine is broken if you want this game you need to have one heack of a pc on single player full graphics usually runs nice for me i do have a gtx geforce 660 ti and a 433 ghz prosseser but sometimes on single player there are massive framerate drops on multiplayer running as low as this game goes im getting about 2030 fps but not always and now lets get to some more good things the vide and screen shots dont seem to capture what this game can really do you can build your own battles so much to do in multiplayer like regular battles to survivals to get a jjob make money and live your life out with the need to buy guns and fight the rebles and the cops or be a reble or a cop the underwater diving and submariens are fun there is litearaly so so so many gear types clothes back packs guns attachments and alot more so yes i do highly recomend this game but only if you have the pc for it
recommended
great game when played with the right group of people single player campaigns while challenging can be a little dull after a while but this seems to be the way of life for games these days edit 16052014  the new campaigns added since i left my review have made the world of difference changes have been made to the game itself and it looks simple beautiful there are lighting effects that make your choice of where you shoot from and approach your enemy critical arma 3 is simply awesome and if youre the kind of player to expect one shot kills with an assault rifle from 100m then go and play cod because you will be sorely dissappointed if however you`re after a genuine challenge of realistic warfare then get this game convince some buddies to join you and get tactical
recommended
if you like realistic war games this has to be yours
recommended
massive massive and one more massive improvement from arma 2 ive only really played muliplayer so i cant really review the campaign but if youre mainly after playing mods such as battle royale then you will be impressed by the improvement from arma 2
recommended
this game is amazing
recommended
best game for team work and endless fun great graphics too but you need a beasty system though to enjoy max settings cpu hungry
recommended
i still havent learned how to drive
recommended
best game i have ever played the arma series is realy improving from arma2 to arma3 the graphics are superb frame rate is good overall it still needs some work on campaign and map design i recently read a post from the mayor of altis and he said that it turend their peaceful little island into a battleground and that it showed a local buisness factory that is private and secret overall i rate this game a 4 out of 5
recommended
great game worth every cent
recommended
play altis life mod on this its absolutely brillian blackwing gaming

i got shot dragged into a garage was told i was now a sex slave and tbagged until my inevitable death i then went back and thanked the people for that experience and they shot me again
recommended
i had got addicted to arma 2 combined operations before this game the semifutureistic feel this game has did not grab me at first by after a while i loved it great game for modding also infact it is so good for modding that my mod folder is now more than 3 times the size of the game folder bohemia interactive did a very good job on this game i recommend i give it a 9510 ps do not stand on jagged rocks or rubble  the result is not favourable
recommended
as all arma games they are hard to figure out the controls but bieng the next step after the most realistic game in the world its understandablearma three has greatly improved its campaign after arma 2s rather terrible one arma s is actually worth playingwhen it comes to multiplayer in a arma game there is nothing like it ranging from altis liferole play to conquoring the whole vast 270 sq kilometers of altisi would definately recommend this game to anyone that has a computer that can handle itnomatter if you have the recommended requirements or not as you can imagine this game puts a load on computers
recommended
this game is awesome love altis life the most 
recommended
this game is amazing d 1010 btw u need a good pc to run this
recommended
this review has been amended and updated to reflect a major change in the game arma 3 brought the arma infantry formula to its most refined and now it features a more advanced flight model to compliment that its still overpriced at $60 but would easily be worth a reduced price on sale this review will be amended if and when they change the afv physics and interface
recommended
if you want a tactical game its a game for you

pretty fun although it still runs like its a windows xp game

very cool game lots of mods
recommended
a great game that i purchased for around $32 in the alpha early access special with limited content in the alpha i expected a much more robust library of content in the future with the beta and release my expectations were partially met but the campaign is unfinished more than 5 months after release other issues also popped up as well while more than capable of presenting its fidelity the visuals in arma 3 tend to tax the system heavily esp in multiplayer and w a sapphire hd radeon 7870 ghz overclocked i am getting around 4050 fps in single player and around 2535 in multiplayer at very high settings the control scheme can also be very difficult to learn if you are not accustom to playing an arma game as i was overall i do enjoy the game however the altis life multiplayer game type is what i enjoy the most and breaking point is fun as well the game is continually improving but the release date seemed way too rushed
recommended
pretty much what its advertised as only more impressive way more pretty than the last one way easier to set up way more fun
recommended
played a few hours its fun
recommended
really amazing p

great combat sim be it as infantry or pilot big platform beautiful engine lots of mods different mp gameplays great community lots of sleepless nights when conducting large organized warfares its the closest sim to real life u either love it or hate it  there is no in between

arma 3 is a great game making many improvements on arma 2 but it doesnt feel like its finished yet i know its still being updated but as its out of beta i thought it would have more than what is has at the moment saying that its still worth a pick up
recommended
arma ii with physics finally
recommended
seems great but not worth it at full price too buggy for that wait for a smokin deal
recommended
its awesome but it is best to play with friends
recommended
its awesome video game and i recomend this game for all but try to buy it in sale cuz its expensive  
recommended
i really love this game there is some glitches though not that much and is very fun to play with friends or teamamates there are things like roleplaying servers where you have to act just like you act in life and another is wasteland which is just trying tu survive you need to find your stuff and survive i really like this game and i could play it for days striaght without stopping because its just so fun add me as a friend and we could play arma 3 sometime  i am always on 
recommended
bit fkn pricey m8

arma 3 review arma 3 is one of those games that just cant be put away for very long at all with endless playermade content a wonderful modding community and the most realistic gameplay in a military sim ever arma 3 deserves to be game of the year  and is a personal favorite of mine arma 3 just can not be compared effectively to any other game on the market today  military simulator  is quite a hefty task to do im sure and bohemia interactive nailed it and are continuing to support the game and update it regularly one thing for new players thatd id suggest is this the game is meant to played in any way so expect that with different servers and gamemodes the most common gamemodes i see today are wastelanda teambased survival mode where players must scavange for food water and other supplies to live altis lifea mode focused on everyday life in altis and this does include the criminal part of the island along with its police counterpart and finally invade and annexthis gamemode is all about team workits a coop gamemode so players vs ai and tactics to capture all the major areas in altis all in all with its wonderfully crafted enviroments excellantly made campaign and multiplayer scenerios most made by other players beautiful graphic design and rich gameplay mechanics arma 3 is definitely a game that deservest the attention and love its getting tldr arma 3 is the best most realistic military sim youll ever play 1110 d
recommended
played arma2 and arma2 arrowhead all i can say it has the same spirit the same awesomness like the others maybe for me its too desert type map i liked more grass but there plenty of mods to fix that and of course battle royale  breaking point makes it even more playable and koth or wasteland is still fun as hell and not to forget about life mode its simply amazing must try
recommended
lots of fun to be had 
recommended
this game is total sweets
recommended
this is undoubtably my favorite game ever this game is not like arma 2 this game is not so realistic that when you play it your head wants to explode this game is basically a more realistic battlefield 4 but if for some reason you get bored of all of the combat and explosions in the normal game try some altis life or maybe some wasteland the final thing i want to say is i would buy this game over any game in 41 game library period
recommended
for those who have doubt about arma 3 because of the instability and glitchiness of arma 2 rest assured arma 3 is very well optimised and way more stable i had doubts but thanks to the free weekend i now know that it wont make my computer swoon also its a ton of fun by the way
recommended
this game is just to good

great game very challenging and reallistic combat not forthose who play cod or battlefieldits a very hardcore game and makes you feel like a real soldier and puts you right in the heart of wari love this game alot more than any other shooter out there i just hope there will be an arma 4 sometime

best military simulator ever made
recommended
pls add swords to this game
recommended
most played in my library for a reason the workshop and people who continuosly add more to this game make it worth every penny and some this game fills the role as a war sim survival rp helicopter fighter jet and even go kart game and so much more do it
recommended
this is the best military shooter i have ever played with the option to download and create content from the workshop you have the option to play this game for ever  only downside is the fact that i need to wait for the campaign but hey enough to do until then  910
recommended
arma 3 & dayz r not just a normall games to play  its a life to live 
recommended
honestly i didnt think the arma franchise could get any better a3 proved me wrong just get the game youll enjoy it
recommended
i love this game so much
recommended
this is not your typical shooter it is more of a simulation game with firefights usually at football feild lengths away unlike the close quarter battles in cod or moh this is not a shooter with tightly scripted fights and cynimatic bravado it is a sandbox game in the truest sense of the word especially with the games support of the mod community if you have basic scripting knowledge or patience then the game opens new possibilities with the fantasic mission editor that alows you to set up single and multiplayer firefights in minutes lastly the multiplayer is fun though i find multiplayer is better at a smaller scale with friends on custom missions though if you can get into a warefare game it is a lot of fun playing a large scale realistic rtsfps
recommended
i would definitely recommend this game if you are in to tactical  and great graphics 1010 stars

i downloaded breaking point a basic dayz mod for arma 3 with the main maps and some other maps if you like dayz and arma itself too buy it i force fed a can of hotdogs to a stranger and killed someone with a brick like team survival games with objectives check out wasteland want to become a druglord try altis life want to do realism arma has that too think of arma 3 as a giant sand box game that has everything you want but still contains that military realism
recommended
its not a ordinary shooter its a real war in your computer
recommended
this game is amazing the simulation feeling you get while playing this game is amazing the roleplaying gamemodes just create that edge that makes you want to play it even more graphics are amazing physics are amazing nuff said
recommended
playing arma 3 in a tactical manner alongside random people you dont know assigned to different squadrons fulfilling different roles on the battlefield is among the most rewarding multiplayer experiences ive had in gaming in a very long time highly recommended combat sim immersive and lots of features combat stances etc 910
recommended
its sooo good i recomend this game
recommended
i camped in a gunstore for 5 days and it took 3 tries with a tank and mg crew to dislodge me 1110
recommended
i mostly play wasteland and king of the hill but with its mod support and range of ingame fidelity im surely to play this game for a very long time
recommended
a war simulator that lets you play almost any possible way you could imagine i can go from stabbing turtles to jumping off a cliff with an atv to flying a group of soldiers to a destination in a helecopter to becoming a gunner in a tank full of a crew of actual human beings from across the world to being a cocaine dealer in a gang to being the cop that catches that dealer and im only talking about multiplayer i have yet to really take advantage of single player
recommended
this game is so much fun and each time i play it i cannot stop playing it if you play with friends it makes it that much better but without friends i have the same amount of fun
recommended
yes absolutely and easily one of the best games ive played on pc a must buy
recommended
great
recommended
this is one of the most badass games ive played in the last 3 years
recommended
sometimes i play this only for enjoying some quality time on the beach with my helicopter 
recommended
this game is a massive improvement from arma 2 the gunplay is significantly better and the map is great if you like military simulators look no further
recommended
provides whole solid minutes of gameplay without crashing amazing right running at a maximum of 1419 fps shocking i am stunned by this game 1010
recommended
must play with a clan totally worth the money if played like that
recommended
great game if your a fan of bohemia its a must have
recommended
one of the rather better shooters 1010 for quality
recommended
if you play call of duty all the time try this game
recommended
imo this game it so cool i can be a soldier without joining a military but this game its so expensive 
recommended
one of the best combat simulators on the market to date the shear scale of this game is immense and as bohemia have made the game totally open to the mod community it has the largest amount of content imaginable in any game i have played you want solo you got it you want pvp you got it you want team play pvp you got it you want team play against ai you got itit literally has everything training maps under water jets helicopters tanks infantry spec ops honestly i simply can not rate this game any higher for the money and the graphics engine is absolutly fantastic if you got a decent rig you need this game the only downfall is the modding side can take some getting used to but playwithsix and armaholic have made it very easy to mod this game for beginers and their is enough information out there to help anybody quite simply a must have game for the price and tbh i have not played a better game ever on pc that has this much depth variety of play and beauty
recommended
this game is absolutly incredible
recommended
looks great for an alpha build lots of community content in the workshop and the first dlcmission due soon great graphics etc if your pc can handle it 910
recommended
this may very well be one of the best games i have played this year one thing which is sure about this game it has unlimited content because the community behind this game is hands down the biggest one for any game but be advised this isnt just a fps its a simulator arma 3 is still in development and will never be truly be finished because the community will make heaps of content for this game even now when the campaing is only 23 finished it already has loads of content i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a realistic game
recommended
dont play any multiplayer i got my a3 key stolen and battleeye wont help in anyway however it is a great game and i recommend buying
recommended
fun game a step up from the previous title
recommended
amazing game the life mod also changed and bringed a lot of rpg  rp lovers to buy this game
recommended
runs smoother then the last and theres already alot more diverse mods and game modes
recommended
is very fun
recommended
its a lot of fun how ever it needs a favorite server tab so you can find servers you like to play on easy but thats it
recommended
brilliant graphics and amazing military experience  mein furher steiner
recommended
so far its pretty much the best milsim out there bar none i do wish for a mod to include realistic reloading animations and a mechanic that recognizes bullets in the chamber negatives are the extreme amount of wasteland servers out there and complete lack of proper pvp servers that are friendly for playing without friends for better or worse unless you for some inexplicable reason actually like the wasteland mod youre better off playing the coop servers where its you 20 or so other folks customizable loadout ammo crates and places on the map to clear of enemy ai game looks good and its a real treat for such a milsim to look good and have alot of potential draw distance
recommended
devs have slightly increased multiplayer fps since the release the game engine sucks but arma 4 should be good if they develop a new engine
recommended
arma 3 is the current pinnacle of tactical military sims the multiplayer is home to diverse community driven missions mods and addonsthe scope of which is ever expanding the single player campaign though clunky at times with trigger based scripted events and obtuse progression is engaging and immersive the maps are incredible stratis is a fantastically detailed compact island only 20 sq km it features rugged terrain a city small villages an airbase and fobs of various size altis offers a massive experience at 270 sq km its a fantastically beautiful mediterranean environment with cities towns highways military complexes airports airstrips fobs resorts energy stations ruins castles islands critically one of the best environments in gaming
recommended
i trolled in global chat 1010
recommended
probably one of the best games ive ever played the amount of mods and features in this game is great and if you can pick it up on sale its a bargain if youre expecting to just run around shooting thats not going to happen this game is a lot slower and requires tactics and intelligence to succeed a great addition to the simulation and shooter genres with the open world which could only be compared to the size of maps such as dayzs youll be completely immersed and entertained somehow by traversing and exploring the map in the different game modes online and offline with mods like altis life breaking point wasteland invade and annex youll never be without a new game mode to pour hours into with your friends and the modding community is truly amazing with the singleplayer missions and sandbox scenarios available and being developed i could not recommend this game any more than i have its my most played game on steam and will stay that way
recommended
this game copied off of call of duty run and gunners get 37 kills while the 37 campers scratch their balls and die then they have these ai missions made by babies for babies easiest game i have ever played gonna have to give it 010 no quickscoping
recommended
okay if you are getting the d3d error your graphics card cant handle it just buy a better one its completely worth it best game ever
recommended
very realistic military detail accurate radio chatter sounds and ballistic mechanics use of tactics is vital unlike call of duty and that crap where you shoot your way through everything if you want to immerse your self in a lifelike warzone experience wait till this game is on sale and buy it
recommended
this is war d
recommended
i have to say this game is dam realistic  and perfect even without that mod called dayz
recommended
spend 40 minutes just to form a group with some guys to attack the enemy base and then my computer turned off 1110 would play again to do the mission again d
recommended
great
recommended
my favorite shooter so much to do and learn its awsome sp pretty good aswel much better mp with a good team and a optimised mapmission
recommended
this is an amazing game king of the hill is a fun sector control game but he cake is given to the breaking point zombie mod at only a mod of a few months already better then day z sa
recommended
pretty fun game and it runs better than arma 2
recommended
it looks sweet runs good but the controller layout is all over the place and you cant change it 
recommended
pure awsomeness
recommended
this is one of the most amazing games i have ever played all of the stuff that were obnoxious and annoying are fixed in arma 3 i totally recommend it
recommended
arma 3 is very different from arma 2 it is not a game for people that want fast action gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the small things this game requires patience and tactical skill there are experiences in arma 3 that you will not experience in battlefield or call of duty for example the tactical aspect of arma 3 if your lucky enough to be part of a tactical community then you can get the full benefits of playing arma 3 not like wasteland or altis life arma 3 has burst up from the old armas from the help of dayz im not saying dayz game arma all the populatrity but it defintly gave them the boost they needed i remeber when i first joined a tactical server i was a noob i had no clue what these call signs ment or any command chain but i was rushed to a heli and placed into bravo squad i was told to stick next to the medkit when i look back i think i chose the marksman load out i was not very useful to the group in till we revived a lot of heavy fire once are squad lead went down it was just me and the medic as the medic couldnt go down i had to rush out into the feild dragging theese random people back to cover now i did not know any of theese people but in the moment it felt like i did i felt like i was part of the team once i dragged half of my bleeding team out i was assigned a special job i was given satchel charges to blow up the objective when i came up to the tower i had a little trouble setting it but never the less i manage to place down the charge as i ran back in a big rush to the heli evac i looked around and saw the tower blow it came crashing down into the hill at the moment i relised this is what arma 3 is ment to be like 9510 lewis
recommended
i love this game when it works lately ive been unable to play multiplayer any type of singleplayer mode works fine as it just causes my computer to freeze when i join a lobby it forces me to quit the game through the task manager doesnt always work and even then causes things to not work at all forcing to do a restart its a shame as the game itself is amazing sadly there doesnt seem to be any clues as to why this is happening or of a fix even though there are several reported instances of this happening from many other people hopefully someone figures out the cause of this and it gets fixed
recommended
arma is a game that takes a type of person to like it it has its glitches and its awesome things altis life is something you should check out if you are more of a casual rp player if you are more serious try out a mil sim server where literally everything is simulated like the military there are also domination servers where you capture towns from enemy npc forces if you have no patience there is always wasteland or king of the hill where you can shoot people on sight without worry of a ban personally i think arma is a great game i would give it a 8510 due to the arma glitches and learning curve they are working on fixing the learning curve though i would like to see more out of the devs even though i believe they are working hard most of my time is from playing on an altis life server  therevolutiongaming finding a good community for casual rp is what i look for and have found it there
recommended
fantastic the level editor is mostly what i do but still mods are great community is nice everything is spot on i also hooked up a flight stick and throttle and did tons of dogfights it feels great specs are a little bit demanding too
recommended
best game ever you wont regret this one
recommended
found a tank killed a naked guy made millions d
recommended
i love this game and have played with it for almost a year i do recommend for anyone who is into tactical and teamwork based fps
recommended
probably one of the best fps military simulator with endless user addon and mods i have ever played in my life its to the point this game is the only one i still play its far from call of duty and sort of reminds me of the old battlefield games but better i give it a 1010 not for the game only but the the continuous community and their mods
recommended
i cant complain this game delivers on what i was exspecting i have all other games in the arma series aside from a small few of the arma 2 expansions i love the ballistics you get a more realistic feel for how a real firearm operates there is much more to take into account than your simple fps the series is great and worth a try the controls can be intimidating but they are managable if you invest some time in training and getting a feel for it this is a simulator so things are gonna be alot tougher than your typical war game the ai friendly ai could use some more fine tuning and tweaking i have had to put a few bullets into a couple insubordinate ai team mates for laying fire on targets a 1000 meters away thus helping bring more aid and attention to the base we were originally assaulting the game is not without its bugs and it is also a heavy on your processor much like arma 2 was but indeed it is definatly a step up in graphics it could use a larger armory but there is a great mod cummunity that works on things like that to help the process along cant wait to get my saitek x55 rhino pro hotas to be able to enjoy the helicopters alot more
recommended
i absolutely love this game mainly for the mods to it i really enjoy playing rounds of battle royale it is even better with a few teammates it can get pretty intense at times i do like their breaking point mod it can get pretty intense 1010 gameplay experience
recommended
the most dangerous things in arma 3 are as follows stairs ai rocks teammates the car you are driving the enemy
recommended
my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game ever were on our way to the objective a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces im leading a team of 4 men we come to a crossroad and i sprint across telling my men to hold back i cross a few more times trying to get a response from any snipers nothing i run my saw gunner runs my medic runs but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through remember the sniper scene the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down he then takes two more in the chest the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills he played it up to 11 here he screams as hes being shot crawling drenched in his own blood sarge you aint leaving me out here like this right ii wanna go with you guys cmon sarge hhelp me cmon please dont leave me he died after that i cried and he respawned i would recommend getting 
recommended
drove an atv while laying down only super elite combat units can do this 1010 its like skyrim but with guns  ign
recommended
dont hesistate buy it
recommended
one of my all time favorites game has come a long way from operation flashpoint and it doesnt disappoint
recommended
best game cause theres no other words to describe this
recommended
arma 3 is a very diverse game with many different games modes and mods some of the popular gamemodes are king of the hill battleroyale and wasteland there are also many cooperative mission you can do with people if you choose to do so you can instlal different mods like guns vehicles missions and other things then theres breaking point a mod that involves zombies be warned it is a very big download like 20 gb it can be hard to survive people and most people will try to kill you so be warned last note is there is going to be a arma 3 epoch namalsk map coming
recommended
this game is one of the rare game that has always something new the community is big and has a lot of modders you will always find something to do but i warn you it doesnt run smoothly often and for me this is the only problem i hope you will consider buying it if you are looking to play for tones of hours and fun see you on arma
recommended
this game is a fun open world game if you have money and you like military play this game
recommended
i need help i got a big lg tv and on arma the fps gose down i was thinking if i get a pc screen would that help the fps im playing on a lg big tv but every time i look up at the sky the fps gose up to 50 i get 30 fps on very high so what u think if i get a pc screen would that help the fps 
recommended
great game i always loved the arma series it begon with ofp first arma and the graphics of this game are stunning but i dont like the future vehicles ect but its awsome with mods d
recommended
this gotta be one of the best games i have ever seen
recommended
its one of the most accurate actionmilsim game ive ever played there is nothing else like this out there 1010
recommended
from riding in a gokart attached to a helicopter to stealing peoples organs for moneynot that i do that p one of the best games ive ever played
recommended
i love this game its good graphics and addicting
recommended
i love this game
recommended
cool
recommended
i absolutely love this game and it just keeps getting better so i can only love it more at first it may seem daunting to dive into and get familiar with but after a while of playing getting used to the controls and then learning some of the more advance controls you can wage an entire war by yourself by commanding squads or with friends by playing cooperatively with the steam workshop you can also find hundreds if not thousands of user created missions that are a lot of fun i personally suggest dynamic universal war system for a fun but brutal gamemode that is really good for coop or solo play
recommended
if u have an amazingly good processor and graphics card this game is for u
recommended
game is like arma 2 but with a 3 no but seriously the game fixes a lot of what was wrong with arma 2 dont get me wrong it still has its bugs but hopefully soon the game will be perfect
recommended
this is a great and fun game play it by my self but most of the time i play with my two other friends and when i do it is so fun then theres the graphics i have a hd7970 and on a hundred person server i get around 30fps but other than that i thing that the graphics are a huge update from arma 2 and overall this is a great and fun tactical first person and third person game 8099
recommended
we seriouslly dont need any explanation for this series simply amazing and with the help of the community this get better every day steam workshop is a dream come true for the arma series as it just make the game everlasting from casual to hadrcore sim style gameplay it is all here why have you not bought this already 
recommended
arma 3 is an awesome game that i play often
recommended
there is nothing more to say about arma iii than wow ive been an owner of every single installment in the franchise from the days of the original operation flashpoint the leaps and bouds that the developers have made over the course of the years is astounding arma iii is absolutely astonshing as an improvement from the rest of the series its far less buggy than its predecessor and is updated very regularyl the multiplayer capabilities are awesome and you can lose many hours with your friends developing all kinds of scenarios if you were a fan of any of the previous games this one will not dissapoint
recommended
if you liked arma 2 then you will love arma 3 because it is arma 2 with better graphics and less content i bought it so should you 1010 will have to create your own game to enjoy the game you just bought
recommended
this game was a bit frustrated after counter strike but after a few hours of playing i realised it is not so bad it is a totally different and i must learn how to play this game after a while i understand the flow of the game so now i like it much better i recommend this game for those who like open area combats and slow gameplay compare to counter stike it is more like real world
recommended
dont mistake this game for an fps some people enter into this game expecting cod its not arma is a full battlefield simulator which it does well at in arma youre not meant to feel invincible if you dont take cover youll die if you dont communicate with your squad youll die it has an insane learning curve that will take most people a long time to get used to but only makes it very satisfying once you finally figure out how to fly or use artillery oranything the complicated controls at first can seem annoying but once youre used to them youll be grateful you can stick your head up just enough to see an enemy out of a window without exposing your whole body the games modability makes it possible to play an infinite array of game modes making it difficult to get truly boring while there is a battlefield like mod called king of the hill the size of the maps alone makes the game vastly more complex and thats saying nothing of the array of vehicles that can completely alter the game from just one player knowing how to fly or range a sniper rifle unfortunately the arma engine is well known for how glitchy it can get most of this has been ironed out and the presence of hackers ruining servers has been greatly reduced since early access at times clipping through a wall or falling through the floor of a building still happens but its not so common that it ruins things at the end of the day the game requires being patient and on your toes while communicating what you see with teammates the different mods and game modes give the game infinite potential but the glitches can create issues sometimes arma 3 is a military sim not insert fps here dont get attached to scores and if you find yourself complaining over global that someone using a plane is cheap or a noob close the game and reevaluate who you want to be in life
recommended
really good game with a large number of mods buy it and play it
recommended
fun and open world game with really good gamemodes and lots of fun make sure your pc can handle the game before you get it though
recommended
while i would reccomand this game i am dissapointed in bohemia interactive for making the game more arcady then the previus arma 2 game while the controlls ware refined and improved the graphial fadality is amazing the game lacks in content and optimization a major issue being the fact that if the server host is experiancing 8 fps so will you no matter how many nividia titans you rig together and how many i7s you overclock to  while arma 3 is alot more complex engaging and immersive then olther tittles out there such as carl on duty black cops and battlefield it is indeed a thinking mans game where map reading team co ordination and communication are key it does not acheve the level of immersion and simulation that arma 2 with mods such as ace and acre acheive i defenitly reccomand the game to newcommers to the arma series but arma veterans may be dissapointed to newcommers arma arma allways had quite alot to take in to learn to unlearn things you are used to doing in first person shooters it requires them to learn to use their compass to alert friendlies of contact how to operate as a team and even how to operate their weapon system in a proficent manner accounting for distance and target movement but somethings will be new even to arma vets such things as the stance adjust system and the awful arcady grenade throw bound to g to any arma 2 vet trying to fiddle with his gear thats bad news
recommended
this is an awesome game to play the developer team is really caring about the community the workshop and map editor helps you to do a lot of things that no other games can the hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium plus if you one of those people who play cod or battlefield a lot you may need a few hours to l2p this game arma 3 is seriously an simulation game any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distanceand the ai is pretty good at aiming stay in cover move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island
recommended
let me start off by saying this game is great and the workshop makes it 20x better but in order to give a good review i must give both sides of the story this game is very complex and can be intimedating for the noobie but one of the greatest parts about this games loyal comunity is that no matter how stupid a siduation might be they will still role play it out that is partially why this series seems so realistic the community is great of coarse there are always those people who would rather complain about how bad someone is instead of helping them to become better but most people are willing to help with anything you might need the next thing is to learn the controls it will make your life so much easier there may seem to be many controls but you only use a few of them unless you are a commander also this game is beautiful and usually runs desently well on a mid range pc now i must give the downsides the campaign is ok but it is not arma 2 quality that is the main theme here is that it is not arma2 i dont know why but this game is missing something that both arma2 and arma cwa nailed it seems more directed and controlled that previous installments of the series one will need a mid range ish pc to run this game all in all this is a great game with a wonderful community and it has endless mods from the workshop so if you are debating weather to get the game or not let me make the decisioin for you get the game
recommended
this game is epic gooby breaking point
recommended
this game is like being underwater but the water has been replaced by feelings of isolation claustrophobia and bullets bullets hatefully fired at your face by nameless and unseen minions and these bullets dont stop until you stopmoving
recommended
the most polished smooth arma experience yet and its still in alpha the upgrade to beta then full release looks like it will only be more content as i have yet to find any bugs if your an arma fan this is a must buy
recommended
god game tried it out super good recommend it alot xd xd
recommended
what kind of  is this i downloaded the game and now i have to purchase it
recommended
proper sick game innit bruv
recommended
amazzing but need a good pc  3

arma 3 is an amazing game but right now im having trouble with the workshop so if you buy the game and no workshop shows up its a problem with steam not arma
recommended
great game especially altis life
recommended
great game nothign else to say its really fun to play with friends
recommended
168 hours it is op
recommended
fantastic game 910 visuals are amazing on any setting above medium style of gameplay is completely up to you replayability is infinite audio is brilliant the only downfall is the ai if you have no mods on the settings for their skill levels needs a bit of refining its either theyre as dumb as a stump or so smart that they drop you before you can even get ready definitely recommend
recommended
best military simulation game ever
recommended
buy this game if youre into real military war games again real not cod or anything else this is the perfect war simulator reccomend running the game with high graphics option is the cherry on the cake
recommended
you arent buying just 1 game youre buying a whole bunch of games there are so many good mods for arma 3 that you can have fun with this game for such a long time when you get bored of one mod or gamemode then just play another one this game is worth the full price just for the battle royale mod which i play all the time i highly recommend this game for both hardcore and casual fps players this game can teach you a lot of new skills and improve your gaming experience in a lot of other fps games
recommended
sick af cccc
recommended
this is the most solid simulator out there the game is improved in countless ways since the previous title in the series name a game that can beat arma in strategic military largescale team play none i didnt think so
recommended
great game very friendly community and so much variety within the game itself as well as the mods made by other users like me and you which believe me are great the graphics and quality is magnificent for this map size and even player count some servers have the ability to hold over 100 online players you cannot get these numbers on any other game as far as im aware the performance is great on nvidia however i am not sure it works as good on amd
recommended
not as realistic as call of duty
recommended
great game tonnes of mods definatly recommend
recommended
outstanding military simulator like its predecessor but be warned of its poor optimization as it will bring even the best gaming rigs to its knees
recommended
difficult absorbing i want it so badly
recommended
arma 2 is better but this game is alrgiht
recommended
this is not your typical run and gun game you must take your time to learn the ins and outs i highly recommend it
recommended
i got the game while it was free for two days and it was awsome i loved everything about the game but it was a little to graphic for my windows 7 but trust me this is worth 5999 but make sure your pc can take the graphics
recommended
despite many of its early faults bohemia interactive  as well as the always extremelyactive arma community of modders et al  really pulled the arma universe to a whole new level the graphics are only the beginning of the immersive environment realistic projectile ballistics as well as surprisingly detailed terminal ballistic effects welldone animations especially of essential combat tasks like reloading and the variable stancelean system unfortunately there are a few problems that have plagued arma since the beginning of time namely the ai i say this because even after becoming intimately familiar with the game and the teammate command system detailed commands are bulky at best ai as a whole tends to be relatively oblivious when it comes to medium and crewserved weapons the suppressive fire command does absolutely nothing with your machinegunners and autoriflemen and antitank gunners apparently forget they have 15 pound rocket launchers strapped to their backs and decide their small arms are the most effective weapons against mbts the aerial platforms damage models could be improved as well ie losing parts of the aircraft when you clip a tree or wires rather than just exploding however this would require a lot more work than may be worth it at this point  perhaps later in a3s lifetime fortunately to me despite these at times fatally annoying flaws cough ai cough nothing in the virtual world comes close to the level of accuracy both from the vanilla bi platform and the arma communities multiple mods that arma 3 delivers
recommended
good god the realism in this milsim is just incredible bullet drop survival and the ai is just great arma 2 was good but this this is amazing only thing is the ui is a little hard to adjust to as i am a black ops 2 and bf3 and bf4 player as well 997100
recommended
amazing game great core experiance with full modd support i recomend sixupdater some of the best editor and mission making out there ecpecialy with the new zeus tool choose arma for you military sim needs
recommended
1010 super fun game and the mods are great
recommended
arma 3 is a great improvement over arma 2 and oa this doesnt have m4a1s or m16s but does have the fnx45 masada and others the vehicles are more futuristic so no abrams or blackhawks but all of this is fine because you can download mods or get all in arma to get ported content from the previous arma games over all i think you should get this game and as it says it brings you to war
recommended
think its a good game but you need a good pc to play this game but apart from that its a good decent game
recommended
arma 3 is a damn good game if you like war simulator games so have arma 3 all youre after this game gets 1010
recommended
ive played arma for about a good 3 years now went i first got arma 3 i liked it i was very excited but then theres something im really annoyed by the game would like randomly crash and send me to my desktop every 1 hour or 30 minutes every tim i still recommend this game but thats the only thing i think would be a huge step to fix
recommended
this is a great military sim make sure you have a really good pc though because it can be very demanding at the time no i do not recommend this since the optimization is horrible
recommended
i recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter this game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game controls are most fluid then arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical it does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like rl i didnt log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the sc sector control game mode and its fantastic you gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update
recommended
altis life is dead dont even buy this game
recommended
this game is definately not your standard cod run and gun type of game you are forced to use tactics and the enviroment around you to gain the advantage and with all the multiplayer content as well as custom missionsmods you will never get bored
recommended
this game is great especially with friends breaking point also adds so much to this already amazing game d

arma 3 shows numerous marked improvements over its predecessors but little has changed about the developer andcommunity attitude since arma 2 arma 3 is a good game it feels very refined like a proper triplea title which contrasts immensely with the very unpolished rough but still charming arma 2 arma 3 improves on just about everything from the entry before it movement is fluid smooth and no longer clunky the controls are far less complex and much easier to master and memorize vehicles handle much better and have fully rendered animated interiors i personally found that the game ran a bit better on my system but it can be taxing when a lot of buildings and objects are involved as the cpu often fails to keep up that said arma 3 does fall short in a small handful of aspects that arma 2 does better some people may be turned off by the future setting although it doesnt affect gameplay much all together it is smaller in scale with fewer vehicles factions and maps than arma 2 still arma 3 has its strong points there is a new zues mode in which one player is an omnipotent dungeon masterlike figure who places enemies and allies there are multiple ways to mix and match zues and the game can basically be made into an rts there can even be competing zues however the game does have pitfalls of its own the ai a much chided problem of the series doesnt seem to have any improvements it continues to be brick levels of stupid while also having improbable accuracy allied squadmates almost never follow orders making parts of the singleplayer particularly the second act more frustrating than fun a new stamina system was implemented that adds a new interesting dynamic to multiplayer but since the singleplayer wasnt designed with it in mind the campaign is basically unplayable this to me speaks volumes about bohemia interactives design philosophy and i have to wonder how much effort is put into testing patches and hearing player feedback speaking of players you will find the greatest challenge of arma 3 is the community most of the community is hospitable enough but there is a rampant elitism that pervades the community and makes many players seem like complete twits more often then not threads criticizing the game will devolve into this isnt call of duty you filthy casual or something of the like furthermore this makes finding a unit a very tough search as many are not immediately accepting this can be a challange as multiplayer is the key focus of the game and it is hard to have fun without a coordinated group another major issue is that the mod developers are often overprotective of their mods to say the least with almost all of them refusing to use the integrated workshop or allow any change to their mods these attitudes can be stifling at times in the end my recommendation on arma 3 is based mostly around 1 principle do you have friends you can play with if the answer is no i would say wait until you do or find a potential group to hook up with singleplayerwise there isnt a lot of enjoyment to be had although user missions keep it afloat for a bit if this is a nonissue for you than i definitely recommend arma 3

this is like a drug murder simulation the sound is probably the best thing about this game the first time you fire a simple 65mm round you realize this game is on a completely different level from anything else some games can be more fun but none are more real sometimes youll have memories of killing people on certain maps and youll wake up in the morning and remember it that place you went to and that person you killed genuinely a feeling of disconnection will grow when you play other games because you dont feel like they properly exteriorize a sense of realism compared to arma 3 the sunlight is like video game wizardry ill never understand closing this review ill say you should have confidence in yourself play the multiplayer from the start switch your rate of fire run and kill kill kill
recommended
because its amazingly awesome
recommended
you need to love this game to play this game
recommended
my initial review said that arma 3 would be a great game by late 2014 when more mods and content were released i am glad to say that this became true several months before i expected between the incredible zeus game mode an onthefly mission creator and excellent mods like advanced gameplay mod task force radio and alive this is one of the best coop games available you will need at least 45 people to really have fun in multiplayer but theres really no other game that offers what arma does
recommended
this game is a perfect choice for those who love themselves military simulators while this game does have its downfalls aka its glitches they however are not game breaking slow paced gameplay but not so slow as to get boring i recommend that if you can find a clan group or server that is great and lots of fun stick with it
recommended
this game is very intertaining you can have lots of fun by playing the campaign or online i find the best thing to playis the mod breaking point this is a dayz like game that has a lot less problems you can pick a faction each time you die and respawn
recommended
great game

recommended
pretty mean lacking content but content can always be made and added gameplay is outstanding

this game is a a lot of fun for the right players looking for nonstop spawn and die then its prolly not for you looking for some slower paced tactical action mixed with some intense battles its in there

recommended
this game is amazing you must get it
recommended
i love the game awsome map great textures the hard thing is get used to the control
recommended
a worthy set in the arma trilogy it takes place in the future which allows for more unique weaponsvehicles though this some times can feel like a discomfort vehicles weapons and movements at disposal are all vasely improved and refined as well with such an active modding community and develepors that are constantly improving the game this is an expierence you cant disregard and for the graphics the lighting effects are the best ive ever seen in a video game ever
recommended
really good game but you will have so much lag if your computer is pre2005
recommended
military simulator with extremely large maps lots of different modes and vehicles spent a lot of time on breaking point mod its very fun and rewarding
recommended
rly funa looooot of game modes buy it
recommended
arma 3 so when i saw this game for the first time i thought that soon will release another excellent piece arma however the first disappointment was already in anticipation as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign but this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared but i will not criticize i must say that the guys from bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair etc graphically its a big shift but a new engine this could offer more the playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes despite this however it is compared arma i and ii step backward personally i think that would bohemia interactive could use a better future on the other hand however the campaign is excellent what more can i say final verdict arma iii is an improved forward but it is incredibly untapped potential if it bohemia interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor or even a new engine so it would be something completely different much better 810
recommended
i havent played it too much but i can safely say make some friends and make your friends get this cause its hella more fun when you have a group to play with
recommended
why u read my comment when u can play arma iii 
recommended
its great buy it now

recommended
this is a hardcore militry simulator you could roleplay from marines to navy seals and has an amazing editor and unlike arma 2 it has under water experince and submarines and way better graphics now i dont play many simulators but this is one of my favorits
recommended
its like the old days
recommended
very fun i would recommend this game to multiple people
recommended
a mostly incomplete yet incredibly addictive and detailed sandbox that takes playing army to an entirely new level
recommended
not anyting like the fps your use to its much better if you are looking for a fast paste fps this is not for you requires a bit of your pc but some commands can help run it a bit better
recommended
i shot a bunny at 1150m with a 50cal totally recomend this game
recommended
wanna play a war simulator arma 3 is the best play with friends and have fun
recommended
very fun game it takes some getting used to and you need to know strategy in order to prevail it doesnt take long to learn the game either this game is quite realistic with its weaponry vehicles and physics a workshop in this game means more ways you can experience it allowing you to play playermade missions playermade game modes playermade whatever really you can also install mods from a website called armaholics which adds a higher score in my rating to the game
recommended
i love arma 3 buy it buy it buy it
recommended
the pinnacle of contemporary and future wargaming
recommended
hmm what can i say about arma 3 i mean i cant describe it because of its awesome epicness just buy it and u will never play another game 
recommended
the sheer scale of the maps the roles its crazy though villanlia is alright get a few mods installed and you can have alloooot of fun with it this is the only milsim game ik that does a milsim better though their are alot buggs i heard at least i persoanly have only ran into cliping issues but its pretty good at the end of the day
recommended
the game as a whole looks really good though even me with a good pc struggles to run it on high settings getting 20> fps on high
recommended
very fun game i get some fps lag in cities but overall its too fun to set down
recommended
well this game requires skill alot of getting used to the controls and the feel of the guns its not the common fps but you already know that if your getting the game arma 3 and the arma series in genral have always offered realistic and addictingly good gamemodes and mods and arma 3 has alot of them where is being a rp mod like takistan life all the way to blood thirst survival in battle royale this game offers alot although i may have only 96 hours i have had over 700 hours on my second account i can say this game is truely worth it 810 hit a tiny fence broke my car get the game
recommended
i promised myself i would only play arma 3 until dice fixed battlefield 4 with the prospect of dice never actually doing what they promise i started to settle into arma 3 i immediatly remembered that the relationship when it comes to dificulty kinda goes like this call of duty no skill required < battlefield teamwork required < arma slow steady and a good plan wins the war 100hrs later and i have forgot why i bought bf3 and bf4 i knew they were halfassed but bought them anyway and i got burned by dice arma offers the features dice abandoned with the realism of a tactical shooter you have to have a good mix of ground air and support players to complete any objectives with the larger server capacities it seems i always have teammates around me
recommended
i would highly recommend this game its fun and ive already put some hours on the board in a short period of time
recommended
this game is the worst game ive ever played
recommended
omg when i need to rub one out i play arma iii seriously i beat my meat like it owes me money while driving the vehicles also this is a good game
recommended
i love this game ive been playing multiplayer a lot there past couple of days if you are looking for a real military simulator this is the game for you when you find players that will join a group with you and take the game seriously it is tons of fun this is nothing like call of duty or even battlefield i would recommend this game
recommended
very cpu intensive but great graphics has many different gamemodes to play dont recommend buying this game if you have a bad computer but overall a great game
recommended
a great game if you can run it
recommended
wow when i bought this game i thought that i was going to play it like 1 hour or so but now that i bought it im addicted it has endless gamemodes maybe its expensive but its worth it
recommended
i endorse this product andor service
recommended
arma 3 is an excellent game for 2 reasons number one its engaging and immersive and fun and number two is the fact that bohemia interactive cares about its modding community hence the competition make arma not war but arma 3 comes with a few flaws chief among these in my opinion is optimization as i own a very good midlevel pc and i seem to be getting around 16 to 20fps also is the lack of vehicles and weaponry although i know that is set to change i would have liked the game to be complete and not an about to finish up beta but if you have some friends that are interested then why dont you visit the islands of altis and stratis live a new life in altis or stratis life fight for survival in wasteland or work together to defeat opfor ai in invade and annex just bare in mind that this is a military simulator so no run and gun or rendezooks here just good ol fashioned tactical warfare
recommended
this game is amazing  that is all i have to say about that  if you into games that allow no limits to what you can do with it  arma is the game for you with modding supported from the start of the game and really the core of arma spending 60 bucks on arma is more then worth it i have over 1000 hours now into the arma series and have yet to play any of the campian that bi made most of my time has been into mods like dayz and epoch the communtiy in arma is amazing modders put their heart and soul into making content for this game arma 3 is a game you will for sure get over 5 years of content for free out of it is a must buy for any hardcore fps player hardcore rpg player or any one into mil sim stuff
recommended
awesome game so addictive
recommended
as always for every single arma game the engine is terrible the real selling point is the community mods that have been made
recommended
only shooting game in my library that doesnt make me rage when i die because in this game death can be fun as well weird thing to say i know but when a new pilot takes 20 minutes to get you in the ao then lands the chopper you feel so excited for him only a moment later an enemy aircraft bombs the chopper and your entire squad i personally cant do nothing but laugh when this happens d 1010 restored my faith in bohemia interactive
recommended
great game
recommended
this game is epic gooby breaking point
recommended
this game is like being underwater but the water has been replaced by feelings of isolation claustrophobia and bullets bullets hatefully fired at your face by nameless and unseen minions and these bullets dont stop until you stopmoving

lets get something straight right away i hate shooters ive always been the type of guy who likes rpgs and fantasyscifi games for me shooters are just too how to say this similar for me sure when you first play a shooter you feel engaged in this world where the battlefield comes to life and every action could have an equal and opposite ie death reaction its really fun but as i played more and more shooters they all started to blend together play the campaign that involves either terrorists in the middleeast russia vs america or a black op gone rouge and once youre completely bored with that spend hours on end in the multiplayer there wasnt that exploration decisions in regard to gear and strategy or overall autonomy that many rpgs offered then i found arma ii this was one shooter that i absolutely loved and i easily poured hours into it the fact you could tackle any mission with any strategy even going in with no combat appearel find a server devoted to almost anything ie dayz chenarus life and the variety of missions all entranced me but the main seller for me was the content creator never before in any game had i been able to create what i wanted to at a moments notice found a mission in the campaign to be unsatisfactory just create your own better rendition of it or even your own original idea from scratch i had spent days ingame and when arma iii was announced you can bet that it was an instant seller for me when i got it for $60 i was awed by the improved graphics more introducable interface in the creator and workshop content that was amazing for the first time in a while i felt as the battlefield had come alive and every choice i made had dire consequences it was like i had played a shooter for the first time which is a magical feeling sure the campaign may be runofthemill but you can always make your own mission or even campaign i do have complaints about some of the physics and glitches but 1 it does its job and 2 the game has to load a minumun of 17 spuare kilometres in comparison grand theft auto v had a world size of about 32 miles at most arma iiis biggest map is 270 km for petes sake id be suprised if the game only had twenty known glitches all in all arma iii is worth more than what you pay for it and is definitely headandshoulders above call of duty and battlefield i saw a picture on the internet that sums up my feelings command a soldier image of cod command a squad image of bff or command an army or squad or soldier image of arma iii too whoever posted that picture i deeply concur with you
recommended
this game is breathtaking whether you like fastpaced gunfights longrange sniper duels monstertrucking it with m1a2 slammer tanks playing ace combat with incredibly fluid movement raiding a small outpost of hostile forces with a attack helicopter playing a role in week long serverwide wars doing night raids on an enemy research facility setting up a uav to perform reconnissance on enemy camps packing your scuba gear and checking out the lost treasures of altis and stratis or just hopping in a plane and enjoying the wide vast beauty of this game arma 3 really dominates the realistic military video gamesimulator genre combine some wicked creativity with arma 3s mission editor mode and you can create your own missions and scenarios in the past people have used this to make their own additions to the game such as new weapons vehicles clothing and even entire maps arma 3s customization is endless and will keep you constantly changing guns attachments for them and other equipment to match the situation your in if you feel like playing solo arma 3 has totally revamped its campaign mode to keep the players attention and actually immerse you in the arma universe or forget the singleplayer all together and go play good copbad cop on altis life a user created gamemode or blowing up tanks and getting in random firefights with other players in wasteland also a usercreated gamemode if none of this satisfies you then you can always just build your own mission so that you and your own private team can go and enjoy a experience that i guarntee you is as close as youll get to war before enlisting

this game is nothing but amazing i dont have a bad word to say about this game this game is even better when being used to play dayz a must have for any arma fan
recommended
i recommend this game to all army fans out there but 1 thing you have to keep in mind very big game you need a very good computer to run it i warned you final rate on game 910 needs more fps community for this game is just fantastic everyone is helpful and game is heaven for teamwork gameplay il be honest i get the chills when i play it  gives you goose bumps  tytomgaming

arma 3 brings a new aspect to gaming and to simulation gaming being a leading developer in military simulation bis strived and excelled its past accomplishments with arma 2 and its dlcs me being in the military i enjoy this game from playing arma 2 and its dlcs bis has done a wonderful job with this one from customizing your weapons to playing cas in its new a164 wipeout arma 3 brings future warfare to todays technology personal rating 0910 edited 20140619

arma iii what should i say i love the game and have been a big fan of the whole series as you can see i have put allot of hours in this game and i have bought it since alpha and seen the progress yet i am abit saddend about the progress i had high hopes they made the engine better on the ai part that is yet that still kinda sucks and i can imagine it is hard to make it better because the engine they use is just a improved version of the same engine they used in arma ii neither do i see allot of content on weapons and vehicles which kinda bums me out and i think the main reason is because they want modders to add that content and fill the gap problem is no one including me wants to download allot of separate files just to play on one server unless its pretty amazing and again dont get me wrong i love this game i just think the main focus on this game has been badly placed and with the setting the game is placed in the future 2030s they have allot of free space to use their creativity i do need to add that the movement system has improved insanely from its previous game other than that it is still a game i would recommend you should buy if you love military sim games where tactics overpower the opponent or games where you need to roleplay as this game is a perfect platform to do so
recommended
if this game was a woman i would pursue her until the end of the earth trying to touch her face with my unworthy hands

getting high and listening to enya 1010
recommended
can be really buggy at times and not very well optimized however i usually have no framerate issues with a modest pc that being said this is also one of my most played games this is what the battlefield series should have become wasteland mod anyone large open map customizable weapons a plethora of vehicles and the list goes on ive recently seen comments about the graphics  but truth be told i actually love them just the other day i remarked to a friend how much i enjoy the landscape and graphics in general especially compared to games like bf4 and cod that look so artificial anyways this game may not be for everyone  but it is for me
recommended
1010 would play again
recommended
are you into fpss like cod you are than i dont reccomend this game ohhh your a fps man that likes tactics and slow pased combat i recommend this game
recommended
amazing game if you give it a chance and tinker with it mods alive and ace when released especially has changed this game for the better dont knock it for the odd issue here or there the community are the guys who make this game really shine only advice i can offer is get part of a community to really enjoy this game after all the makers gave us the sandbox but its the community who make the sandcastles out of this game
recommended
even though the game is still work in progress it gets better every update with the help of testers from the arma community  is it 100% finished not in a long way but i enjoy every minute of the game sp and mp this is game is never going to be 100% finished modsaddonsscripts wil come from the community and make the game even better after the developers stopt creating new stuff
recommended
hell freakin yea buy this this just shows the power of the pcmasterrace best exclusive ever i reccomend this series more than any other game everyone needs the chance to play this game i reccomend it more than any other game ive ever played most amazing thing that ever happend to me buy it

it looks sweet runs good but the controller layout is all over the place and you cant change it 
recommended
pure awsomeness
recommended
this is one of the most amazing games i have ever played all of the stuff that were obnoxious and annoying are fixed in arma 3 i totally recommend it
recommended
arma 3 is very different from arma 2 it is not a game for people that want fast action gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the small things this game requires patience and tactical skill there are experiences in arma 3 that you will not experience in battlefield or call of duty for example the tactical aspect of arma 3 if your lucky enough to be part of a tactical community then you can get the full benefits of playing arma 3 not like wasteland or altis life arma 3 has burst up from the old armas from the help of dayz im not saying dayz game arma all the populatrity but it defintly gave them the boost they needed i remeber when i first joined a tactical server i was a noob i had no clue what these call signs ment or any command chain but i was rushed to a heli and placed into bravo squad i was told to stick next to the medkit when i look back i think i chose the marksman load out i was not very useful to the group in till we revived a lot of heavy fire once are squad lead went down it was just me and the medic as the medic couldnt go down i had to rush out into the feild dragging theese random people back to cover now i did not know any of theese people but in the moment it felt like i did i felt like i was part of the team once i dragged half of my bleeding team out i was assigned a special job i was given satchel charges to blow up the objective when i came up to the tower i had a little trouble setting it but never the less i manage to place down the charge as i ran back in a big rush to the heli evac i looked around and saw the tower blow it came crashing down into the hill at the moment i relised this is what arma 3 is ment to be like 9510 lewis
recommended
i love this game when it works lately ive been unable to play multiplayer any type of singleplayer mode works fine as it just causes my computer to freeze when i join a lobby it forces me to quit the game through the task manager doesnt always work and even then causes things to not work at all forcing to do a restart its a shame as the game itself is amazing sadly there doesnt seem to be any clues as to why this is happening or of a fix even though there are several reported instances of this happening from many other people hopefully someone figures out the cause of this and it gets fixed
recommended
great game nothign else to say its really fun to play with friends
recommended
168 hours it is op
recommended
fantastic game 910 visuals are amazing on any setting above medium style of gameplay is completely up to you replayability is infinite audio is brilliant the only downfall is the ai if you have no mods on the settings for their skill levels needs a bit of refining its either theyre as dumb as a stump or so smart that they drop you before you can even get ready definitely recommend
recommended
great game very challenging and reallistic combat not forthose who play cod or battlefieldits a very hardcore game and makes you feel like a real soldier and puts you right in the heart of wari love this game alot more than any other shooter out there i just hope there will be an arma 4 sometime
recommended
this game is so much fun and each time i play it i cannot stop playing it if you play with friends it makes it that much better but without friends i have the same amount of fun
recommended
perfect sim for those wanting something more than casual games such as cod or battlefield offer arma ii is still the big boy but 3 is shaping up to match or exceed the older but still massively popular sim the engine is a bit smoother and the setting more futuristic but other than that it plays very similar
recommended
this game is incredible
recommended
i gladly dropped part of my paycheck on this game and ever since its release it has kept me entertained through the various gamemodes it offers if you do happen to get tired of wasteland altis life etc you can check out armaholic and download many more mods and missions to work with the game does have its bugs but in reality every game does they may or may not get said bugs worked out but we can only hope if you want to screw around on a milsim that has many things to offer arma 3 is the game you want to pick up
recommended
the most strategic fps game i have ever played i love the game because it is filled with hard campain missions and an amazing multiplayer
recommended
i have to say this game is dam realistic  and perfect even without that mod called dayz
recommended
went full speed down a mountain crashed into a tree and i exploded into pieces 1210 its okay

bought it a few days ago now i have 136 hours of play time if you value friendships your going to need to not to they will dwindle if you get into this game which it is very easy to as there is alot of content
recommended
id  the  on this game any day of the week m8 almost onpar with victoria bitter so thats in sayin something m8 m8 play it and if you dont like it you are a in gypsy
recommended
great game to play especially in multiplayer with friends the combat system is top notch and the graphics are great if you have a good enough pc to run the game in multilayer the game has its flaws at times with fps dips on some servers but if you can get past that the game is amazing the mods for this game is where it shines for me personally mainly the wasteland mod and the life mod on the right servers you will find yourself hundreds of hours of fun easily just by how tense the game can get my recommendation is to only buy this game if you have a few friends who are willing to play with you also if you want to play wasteland only play on samatra servers this way you can reach 60fps quite easily in ultra if your pc is good enough otherwise you will have to play on the not so optimized regular wasteland servers with low fps 3040 or less
recommended
you are kidding me right you are selling the completed version of the game that should have been released in the first place for $20 more have you idiots fallen out of your tree it was my understanding that you sold the other version because you couldnt finish the single player campaign in time for your release date things you need to address you need to work on your multiplayer experience we your customers love and support you guys cause you have a great lineage but dont  down our backs and tell us its raining please move from the same gamespy technology that you have been using for over 20years old and get something more updated also spend a little money on the community by getting us some local servers that we your customers can use here in the states without a damn 100 plus ping get your in game comms together to optimize bandwidth the sounds in arma 3 are still a little campy i know you dont want to have to pay for a sound engineer to actually do some sound mapping from real guns but guess what this is a real gun sort of experience so suck it up and get it done we are your customer not some blind village idoit you can simply pick pocket when you want more money so dont treat us like one regards tat
recommended
what the hell are you waiting for have you seen the options you can do start throwing money at your screen noawwwwwwwwwww
recommended
get it and play it enjoy it it is alpha and it will have annoying bug or something weird
recommended
very good very hard very laggy at times arma 3 is great its fun tactical and all that good stuff the community made content is fantastic and the multiplayer is great if you find a decent enough server however it does carry over quite a few problems from its previous installments some of these incluce extreme difficulty navigating buildings due to weird responsiveness of controls nearly all of the building are unfournised too much wasteland servers a lot of mp servers are laggy as hell vehicles made out of ing paper that aside its still the best shooter i have played as of yet
recommended
the game is a veery good militairy simulation game even tough its more arcady in some aspects its still a good game  the build field manual can give you somme good info about somme of the mechanics and you can try them out in the editor it takes somme time to get the hang of using the editor but the free zeus mode dlc is another way to setup missions for testsetc which is simpeler then the standart editing screen the games goes realy in depth in somme aspects so i suggest trying things out in the editor or looking them up on the internet becuas sometimes the field manual doesnt give enough info the game is pretty hard tough to begin with especialy if you never played tactical realism on arma 2 but if you get the hang of the mechanics and how evrything works try joining a server most of the community is pretty friendly so they will help you out if you need help with somthing just a small side note  most poeple prefer you having a microphone or at least responding in chat be aware most poeple want you to use the correct channals if you dont know what channal is used for what just ask them
recommended
a fantastic game for those who love the arma series the game uns very smooth and there are many things to do with the editor and even the multiplayer gaphics are insanes aswell as the animantions and even the gun play seems a bit better i would recommend this game to any friends  this is a cpu intensive game and would recommend you to use a higher end cpu and gpu if needed
recommended
really an amazing game will all the different mods that one can play eg best mods for me is wasteland altis life and breaking point

there is nothing quite like this game when you are in a full scale firefight exchanging rounds helicopters flying over head your squadmates moving to flank the other team you arent alone in this battlefield though many other firefights could be taking place anywhere on the map you have free range to go where ever youd like on the maps which are huge be forwarned though youll want to either ride or drive a vehicle if you have to run anywhere over a couple kilometers another warning that this game is not like call of duty or battlefield it has a much more realistic feeling and is much harder doesnt have an rpg system of leveling up and you there isnt a scoreboard that being said when you pull of something tactical with your squad or do a combined strike with your team it is so rewarding and fun there are mods for those of you that dont like just the base game i havent played breaking point but i believe it is much like dayz a zombie survival mod with permadeath there is also king of the hill wasteland and a few other things i mostly play the game for multiplayer but there is a mission editor to make missions or to just spawn stuff and fight there is also an episodic campaign that bi is releasing mod tools have just recently been released the game is early in its life and is going to hit full stride in a matter of months if you want to see whats capable check out how arma 2 is now now on to opinions of techincal things the sounds in this game are amazing and the graphics are also phenomenal for such large maps the lighting is crazy good especially at night the physics are a little iffy and there are quite a few bugs this is to be expected with such a large world though this is the only game where i actually jump when i get shot at and find myself instinctly ducking at my computer there are only two maps altis and stratis the enviroments have a great mixture from grasslands and forests to villages or cities in terms of content arma 2 has much more but i believe as the game starts to get older the community and bi will start releasing a lot more stuff arma 3s urban fighting is awesome i love it but arma 2 does long engagements better i think the game is pretty demanding i run it on high with a 7850 xfx black edition 2gb 12 gb ram phenom x6 thuban 32ghz and get okay fps the community isnt awful like other fps games i love this game for the realistic tactical and strategic fighting that everyone has to do there are mods for other things which makes me think this game has something for everyone i would recommend this game to someone who is looking for a more mature serious and hardcore community than most other first person shooters as well as looking for a game that is more realistic and team based if the person loved to play lone wolf wanted anything they wanted in content right this second or was easily angered by a bug here and there i wouldnt recommend it to them tldr  graphics sounds lighting all amazing urban combat is better than arma 2 this game is for the person who wants a hyperrealistic first person shooter with heavy emphasis on team work that doesnt mind a bug here and there and isnt bothered by waiting for more content for a little while

arma 3 is a great game making many improvements on arma 2 but it doesnt feel like its finished yet i know its still being updated but as its out of beta i thought it would have more than what is has at the moment saying that its still worth a pick up

one of the only games ive found where you can run througha town naked killing people and hen crashing a helicopter into a building going into an editor and fly with 85 planes behind you

cant get the hang of the real game but altis life is definetly awesome

amazing game truely unique and majorly realistic 10 leagues above battlefield and about 500million leagues above any call of duty game if a challenge is what youre looking for then the campaign on this game is such a challenge even leading your own squad can be a challenege almost everything is driveable good array of weaponary and if you play online it only gets better with altis life and breakingpoint even milsim i recommend you buy this game and support the developers who actually make great games unlike the developers at activision and infinity ward who churn the same garbage out each year
recommended
this game is a branch in a dynasty of games that have been plagued by bugs glitches and errors alike some are really funny some are plain frustrating all together the game can let itself be hated yet the player will likely clock many many hours none the less why because in what other game you get to play in a variety of gigantic maps to play epic missions made by good mates in what game will you play in tense longduration military environments with complete strangers this game will let you experience openworld combat simulation at its finest along with bugs and glitches and desyncs but considering the overall awesomeness of the game those eventually become quite funny or at least acceptable reccomended for the patient mature teamplayer the military addict not reccomended for the immediatesatisfaction gamer
recommended
arma 3 is by far the most realistic most entertaining and most intence war simulator of all time if the technology is availible this game should come out for next gen consoles not only is this an amazing sandbox but it also blows every other war game out of the water keep up the good work bohemia interactive and step aside battlefield and cod because a new age has started the age of a real war

arma ii with physics finally

seems great but not worth it at full price too buggy for that wait for a smokin deal

its awesome but it is best to play with friends

i really love this game there is some glitches though not that much and is very fun to play with friends or teamamates there are things like roleplaying servers where you have to act just like you act in life and another is wasteland which is just trying tu survive you need to find your stuff and survive i really like this game and i could play it for days striaght without stopping because its just so fun add me as a friend and we could play arma 3 sometime  i am always on

1010 would shoot in game again

this is a fun game wish i could afford it
recommended
bugs hackers glitches unfinnished patches unreleased vehicles just right there would be enough to steer away anyone from purchasing this game however even with all that i still will play arma iii the online multiplayer experiences are pheonominal and definetly unique if youve ever played massive online sandbox fps for example planetside 2 you will know the kind of online experiences to expect however unlike other sandbox mmos the experiences you get with arma are changing its not a repetitive boring same old grind depending on what server you want to play on you can find yourself playing with other players against ais using modern military tatics and utilizing resources to save a down player pilot or you can find yourself running drugs in the cover of night trying to evade player police as long as i have played arma iii i cannot say that it has been boring for me however this game is not for everyone so if your not into the sandbox effect i would continue on with your day but if you enjoy unique experiences and a endless interaction then i highly recommend arma iii
recommended
this game is great but be ready to spend hours finding loot

the quintessential first person military sim for the seasoned military shooter fan or firstperson shooter players looking for a bit of depth and substance in a game this aint arcadey casual rambo cod or battlefield rubbish folks this is the realworld modelled experience every fps player should be looking for and if you havent been you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and tell yourself to lay off the drugs

arma iii is the best chopper crash test lsd dragon catch simulator out there watch out for druken pilots and soldier everyone on arma is drunk or has take some drugs and the level beginning euhm i hope were not gonna to die again me too me too  and we crashed again affirmative shi t f a c k well seriously this game is awesome there are bugs there are many bugs but this are funny as hell so if you got so often dissappointed by ea or activision about their next big title you should buy this game at first i was like i dont know arma i wont buy it and then there was a steam sales and arma 3 was free to play and what should i say i got 19hours play time since beginning and just bought that game and a big  is also the multiplayer community is that what it should have been in battlefield almost everyone is nice and you can work as a team together to get your objectiv

its a awesome game its lots of fun

great game loads of fun on any game mode but dont buy it for battle royale since i never got in the servers since they are always full or glicthed
recommended
arma 3so far this is the best game of the arma series i thoroughly enjoyed playing arma 2 and all it had to offer and arma 3 continued that for me the game is much smoother and alot easier to play yet still keeping that challenging aspect it originally had the modding community for this game is amazing and some of the stuff i have seen made and played makes the game itself better than what it already was for anyone skeptical of moving from arma 2 to this dont be its worth the buy
recommended
i ed in my pants when i got this game

if you have played operation flashpoint 2001 youll be right at home with this one  which is my biggest complaint about this game not much has changed in game mechanics since flashpoint the game is still pretty much waypoint oriented and even the editor is pretty much the same meaning for instance setting up custom loadouts needs lots of scripting the ai is downright horrible at times and actions that worked fine in previous releases like driving in a convoy are now nearly impossible with lots of collisions and vehicles getting stuck at least the first part of the single player campaign was a disappointment with most of the action being 4vs4 infantry combat multiplayer and community made mods are what make this game so if you enjoy huge realistic operations with real people or having fun with mods in a beautiful sandbox  then this game might be for you all in all arma 3 is still in development and hopefully it will break free from the old flashpoint mold new features like graphical interfaces in the editor and flexibility to ai behaviour beyond the waypointsystem would be most welcome modifications add a lot of potential and replay value get arma 3 if you enjoy your games as projects 355

great game but it really depends who you are playing with that makes or breaks the game

short and skinny dont buy this if you are looking for an alternative to the big 2 aka codbf series it has never been that and never will be this is mistake 1 with this seriesstyle of simgame people say how is it compared to bfcod its the dead wrong question to ask prefacegeneral now that aside this is a simulator for it to be what you want it to be think again more of a brutal sandbox mode game for either single or multiplayer it doesnt hold hands there is not much for a indication on how you dieyou just die now keep in mind you might travel from 5min to 30min or even more to a target area in a sandbox like this without even seeing an enemypulling the trigger and things can be randonizedand if you screw up or even if you do things perfectto the book you still might insta die because you were in the wrong placewrong timemuch like real war thats brutal to a lot of people who in turn ask the question of where is the fun in that to that id say its what you make of the experience what you feel if you do acomplish someting in it performance my experiences have always been that this sim always runs incredibly better for single player performance for its built in missions or user generated download missionsetc there are infinite downloads for user generated content or you can easily make your own what if missions again you need to think hardcore big sandbox multiplayer can be very fun but user beware its not for the faint of heart if you are looking for a instant run and gun like the intro mentioned titles you are going to hate the expereince its not that at all the community is more niche and if you dont care for that this is not your gamesim also mutiplayer is way more taxing on your system for performance generally speaking depending on the missiongroup size your mileage may vary it does also support track ir5 for those flight sim folks wanting that for your infantry control as well which is almost a must for a hardcore sim like this guns guns guns ballistics are modeled to be as close to possible as the real thing this means gravity droppattern spreads ballistic modeling for impact on various things its a simulator that being saidso many people have become conditioned to balancefairness for multiplayer aspects ie in those fps games they will adjustnerfimprove guns based on player feedback and perfomance largly due to map constraints in the sake of balance vs realism thats not here its all just math in a sandbox to some people that is great to othersa nightmare of people screaming sraw is opgun x is op balance and fairness is not why you play a simulation though also bear in mind its quite common to have fire fights on some areas of 500m or more apart on some areas so again this is where people might not be used to long range tactical combat every weapon in arma is usefull and you will be more concerned about your squad loadout vs your own its not a lone wolf game and there are not statsunlocks how is it vs fill in the blank think of this in this comparison dcsa10c is more akin to the arma series vs say bfcodace combat they all share only one common item war based other than that they are very different experiences games like bfcod you will litterally be pulling the trigger or dieing within seconds of spawning in and if you die the respawn timers are either non existant or a short few secondsits insta action at its core as well as those titles having very enclosed maps vs scale of arma maps arma you will be at a base and it could be 545 minutes depending on a wild spectrum on things whether single player or multiplayer some people cant handle traveling more than 10 minutes to a targetengagement area before becoming bored or will rage quit if they get killed instantly by not using cover there is no red flash retreat to covergenerally speaking in comparison to fpss mentioned above depends on what you got hit by and where 910 youre going to be insta killed this forces very tactical cautious team based game playbecause who wants another 515 minute trip from home base back to the action i play both dcs arma and bf series and they each have their time and place comparing them is hard to do as they are truly not the same genre really the biggest buyer remorse with series like these armadcs is people go into them expecting an alternative to a mainstream bfcodace combat play style only to then find out they stepped into an entirely different genre of gamesim play style like others have saidshould you buy it if you want a brutal infantryground vehichle primarily infantry sandbox large scale map simulation with lots of modding optionsabsolutley if you want a harcore flight sim no buy dcs instead flight mechanics here are more simish than bf but not even close to dsc series you buy arma more so for the infantry combat aspect if you want an alternative to bfcodmoh absolutlety not its not the same genre of software at all i know all the screenshots and user videos can make it appear sobut the reality is that it doesnt play like that at all

one of the best combined arms simulations i have ever played the gameplay is only hindered by the people and community you play with play with an exciting group of people or with friends and you will have all the funny stupid and downright awsome moments you can only have in a few combined arms game however playing by your self is not always boring but not always fun so what are you waiting for try this game out and if you want find a good clan to hang out with and have fun
recommended
very good game the campaign is a large step up from arma 2 being both interesting enjoyable somewhat challenging and free from annoying ai leaders and teammates multiplayer is varied with both casual servers and clan servers with large battles occuring the maps are both beautiful and varied it is also a good template for mission makers the main part of arma iii however is the mods and missions created by the community this is what arma is all about user created missions vary from single player stealth mission to large battles from land and air there are even some more creative mission that allow you to become other things like a police officer bis have given the community an enjoyable game which doubles up as a template for a large amount of mods and missions both new and old there are however some problem namely the optimisation the is very laggy there is however some solutions and after a bit of tweaking the game should be very playable squad management is still time comsuming but after some practice from the campaign it does become slightly easier overall arma iii is an excellent game and has set out on what it was going to achieve become an interesting and enjoyable game while allowing the community to create excellent mods and missions dont listen to people complaining about optimisation and content because optimisation can be solved with a google search and content can easily be fleshed out by those who have excellently contributed to the game on things such as the workshop and armaholic this game is worth every penny
recommended
a great improvement over the second game animations are very good and fluid alot of the clunky controls have been alleviated the games visuals are pretty nice multiplayer is where this game truly shines however to play at a stable framerate in multiplayer you are going to need an above average pc unless you are willing to do some config changes and graphic downgrades all in all i recommend this game its worth its price in terms of content and it has workshop compatibility
recommended
arma 3 one of the best shooter out there on the market  depends on what kind of shooter you like of course  despite of all bugs and glitches arma iii can give a truckload of satisfaction if played with friends in addition to that theyve added the zeus mode where players assume the role of a game master it sounds familiar because the idea is taken by dungeons&dragons the game master has the role to create missions enemies enemies route object and everything he likes its a really fun game as you can see i spent 800 hours on this game and yes i agree i suggest to buy it if youre searching for a serious and hard shooter and the content is limitless all the mode that you find on multiplayer is made by the community

the community is trash its a mix of team killing autism and milsim faglords making  overly complicated as usual with arma games the optimization is absolute garbage and no matter what you do you wont hit 60fps consisstantly in online the guns feel great but have the impact of a pellet rifle especially the 9mm sidearm nato gets the story doesnt make sence but its arma you dont play it for the singleplayer i was very disapointed however that the singleplayer was not coop like in 2 the only way to make this game good is by a having a squad that fits you whether it be autistic milsims people who are just playing to  around or a mixture of both who is in your squad ultimatily deterimines your fun b mods mods mods mods the massive amount of weapon mods spices up the gameplay with familiar faces like the ar platform and ak platform rifles it makes the game much more realistic ironicly c having lots of patience good luck finding a server that is consitantly good that doesnt have faglord admins ive been banned for saying wat isntead of what asking someone to turn down their mic and using opfor weapons while playing as blufor 610 810 with mods be advised when you download mods even if its something as small as a retexture you will not be able to join 50% of the ing servers because arma doesnt like having us filthy modders join vanilla servers so the servers will be split and you will be getting upset because of the lack of a filter between vanilla only and mod friendly servers

this is a high quality sandbox game it has everything to be unique it has a huge map and another very large to you can do squad missions be the leader or to be a soldier and a squad member this game is very interesting and it has vehicles which are very fun to ride the combat is very interesting and sometimes difficult if you want a game like counter strike or call of duty then go somewhere els everyone must have writen that but i will write it to the graphics are awesome sometime it feels real so better have a computer that can run this cause i only have the minimum and i really like the game if you reach max running then there is no bound to how much you will love the game you can check if you can run the game athttpsystemrequirementslabcomcyri single player is interesting and nice but the multiplayer is the real deal you have a lot of servers with diffrent rules and attributes you can drive with some people around the world and survive and you can go to the missions that the server gives you randomaly for ending i really love the game and i want you will to so if you dont want to spend 60$ then wait for a good sale

the multiplayer mods for this are the best

this game is amazing i was worried that i would have bought a bad game for how much it cost but it was really worth every penny out of 10 stars i would give it a 95 and the only reason its not 1010 i sbecuase at first when i started playing it i had extremly low fps and i know i have a very good rig becuase i built it myself so i spent a couple of days trying to figure out what was wrong and frustration everywhere after a while i set the games priority to high in the luanch options and some other tweaks to the game thankfully im experienced with computer hardware but other people with no experience might have alot of trouble with it hopefully you guy scan fix that in some way other than that this game is 10 out of 10 would definitely recommend to anyone i just finished playing it and i started today yeah 7 hours d i had a blast and i will tomorrow too
recommended
fantastic game it really does need some patches more weapons and animation fixes especially with reloading but other than that if you love extremely hardcore games and only hardcore games this game will be bad if your going to play it like cod or bf then this is the game for you considering the state that its in id give it an 8510  but when the devs fix the glitches and animations this game will easily score at least a 9510 for a military simulation it has a very steep learning curve but in 5 hours or so you should get the hang of it d

1st3rd person military shooter with vehicle combat one of a kind modern military shooter with very large battlefields a lot of clothing armor weapon variations weapon modifications ammo types grenades utility tools and different kind of equipment large variety of civilian military armored ground and air vehicles game has great modding tools and support single player missions also included as well as coop and multiplayer modes game has great visuals texture quality animations environments and good voice acting inventory is hard to navigate at first and needs getting used to you tend to die fast and for some people it may be a challenge to stay alive game supports large player count on any given map personally i think this is good improvement over arma 2

very good game i would highly recommend this to anyone that likes a semirealistic war sim this game struggles heavly from optimization issues i have an i5 3570k at 44 ghz and a gtx 760 at best this game will use 60% of my cpu and or gfx card and only getting 2540 fps at 1920x1080 in a busy server in single player i can get up to 8090 fps changing my gfx settings really wont change my fps more than about 10% 910

a fun and addicting game for me started with just the campaign then started playing the breaking point mod which is the arma 3 version of dayz now playing wastle land and altis life this game has a lot to offer and the community additions are great i highly recomend this game if you are a fan of fps games that actually want you to use some tactics

where the arma 2 campaigns were tedious and frustrating due to bugs and poor ai arma 3 is one of my favourite campaigns do far the ai is so smooth its not 100% predictable and it just flows really well congratulations bohemia interactive on really stepping up the game with this wellgame excuse the pun
recommended
fantastic games with a good variety of community made missionsmods etc if you were an avid arma 2 player youll love arma 3 the only problem i could see with this game is that its quite diffrent from other shooter games and maybe a little hard to get into without help from friends that have already been playing this or arma 2

it has everything a person can want in a game

its the bes has a varity of mods its awesome

just buy it no further information needed

a fantastic military simulation game i have not had so much continous fun from a game in years since crash bandicoot on ps1 i cannot express how awesome the arma community is and how much i love the game
recommended
most people dont want to buy this game because they were displeased with the last game arma 2 but bohemia kicked it up a notch im so amazed on how good of a job they did on this game its my money well spent
recommended
this is not a game this is a simulation if anything admittedly its not really war and its not a good representation of the horrors of conflict but its significantly better than call of dutys over romanticized grade 6 representation as for worth this is not a game you can really quantify unlike many games where the campaign length or the multiplayer dictate its quality this is much more than a game if you played and liked arma 1 or 2 buy 3 and if youre thinking about buying arma 3 do it the endless modibility the mission creation and steam workshop and the rich community are what make the arma series a true beauty not to mention the multiplayer and campaign are kick

arma 3 is vary fun yet demanding game if you have the hard ware for this game i would recommend it but if you dont dont even think about it i fyou like milsim this may be the game for you their are a lot of good milsim groups that play this game and they have fun doing it there are tons of mods to make this game so much better than it already is
recommended
an undeniably accurate military simulator no other game like it yes cod boys and bf fans this is very different indeed developed by actual military personel this game is designed to be as realistic to military combat tactics and realismas humanly possible ive played arma ii for years and never did i imagine a game designed for the sole purpose of military simulations take on the challenge of becomeing a modern day platform of arma iii

i truly enjoy this game it is very fun it would be better if the ai werent so strong i swear it takes 10 shot in the head to kill one but other than that it is great

if you enjoy having to trek 3 kilometers to take out one soldier and then trek to the next objective for another 20 minutes real time then arma is your game arma is as close as one can get in a game to reallife combat procedures taking one hit will usually result in death or severe injuryand you dont wanna take a hit when youre 3 kilometers from an objective and have to walk there there are a few things that you should know first 1 combat is slowpaced and tactical 2 there are a lot of different controls that youll need to know 3 the online community is great for help 4 with enough time and imagination there are very few things that you cant docreate in arma the guides that come ingame are very useful and are a mustread if you want to have a good play experience allinall for the amount of content that comes with arma 3 and the amount of content streamingin constantly from users as well as can be made by you this game will give you unlimited hours of entertainment provided that you put the time into learning the controls properly this is a steal for $60 and anything cheaper is almost a crime for the amount of value that lies within this game even if youre not into military shooters this game has more than just something for everyone
recommended
i am a massive fan of all arma games and i can say after a dodgy release bohemia interactive have eventually have brought this game to close perfection and with visuals like this i am hooked if you are new to arma i recommend starting here it gives you clear instructions and a smooth campaign thats if you can run it it has nice mature loyal and welcoming community with the occasional your mum joke that does not hesitate to mod and create user made missions so boredom is rare i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a deeper fps experience
recommended
this game will not measure your kdr this game will not have you grind to unlock weapons or attachments this game will not release 4 expensive dlc patches every year but this game will be more immersive epic and thrilling than any other it will make you feel like a part of something bigger arma is not for everyone one should not be fooled into thinking so the willingness to train practice and execute are not traits everyone posses however should you choose to don the desert camo of blufor the quicksand colours of opfor or the grass greens of greenfor know that you have become part of a community which will grow advance and perfect their craft if youre willing and if you want more than a game arma is the pinnacle of milsims to date update the new zeus game modes are amazing currently availible on the dev build it is difficult to sum up the essence of the gane mode but it is very interesting and my new favourite game mode which is quite an achievement considering ive been around since arma cold war crisis as it is bow known and the opf games

the game still needs lots of work in differnt places but if you have the time to mod it and find the right bunch of guys to play with you will defo fall in love with this game for the price you pay and hours you get need i say more

bohemia please code better thx <3
recommended
great game loads of mods have come out for it problem only exists is that its still badly optimized for amd cpus and to top it off there is no official mods that add in content that have been released
recommended
this game is amazing but its still a unfinished product so just be aware
recommended
excellent game and lots of fun
recommended
glorious arma master race game now looking even better no way to explain it other than by saying it is the greatest game to yet release this year oh wait wrong game its not that good
recommended
holy what can i say bohemia you did it again there is never a dull moment with this game one moment i was walking through a forest with my men being stealthy i took my pants off to be super sneaky and one guy set off a mine killed 2 of my men we had to fight a whole squad of the enemys my heart was racing think you have had enough of this game your wrong there is tons of modders out there creating mods for our entertainment from zombie killing to diving contests there is a mod for you dont feel like playing a mod go to the steam workshop and find a mission that others made for you to play all in all 1210

the only game where i had a un press team try to interview me in the middle of a firefight about the war in altis
recommended
too many wasteland servers more domination and warfare please
recommended
bestest but hosting multiplayer servers should be done by nasa
recommended
arma 3 is an improvement over the previous ones but the game still suffers from clunky interface and lackluster ai for an arma fan like myself though it is the best arma so far
recommended
arma2 with some new weapon stances granade shortcut keys and zeus live mission mode definately worth getting with discount  would not recommend paying full price if u got arma ii already
recommended

1st3rd person military shooter with vehicle combat one of a kind modern military shooter with very large battlefields a lot of clothing armor weapon variations weapon modifications ammo types grenades utility tools and different kind of equipment large variety of civilian military armored ground and air vehicles game has great modding tools and support single player missions also included as well as coop and multiplayer modes game has great visuals texture quality animations environments and good voice acting inventory is hard to navigate at first and needs getting used to you tend to die fast and for some people it may be a challenge to stay alive game supports large player count on any given map personally i think this is good improvement over arma 2
recommended
very good game i would highly recommend this to anyone that likes a semirealistic war sim this game struggles heavly from optimization issues i have an i5 3570k at 44 ghz and a gtx 760 at best this game will use 60% of my cpu and or gfx card and only getting 2540 fps at 1920x1080 in a busy server in single player i can get up to 8090 fps changing my gfx settings really wont change my fps more than about 10% 910
recommended
a fun and addicting game for me started with just the campaign then started playing the breaking point mod which is the arma 3 version of dayz now playing wastle land and altis life this game has a lot to offer and the community additions are great i highly recomend this game if you are a fan of fps games that actually want you to use some tactics
recommended
battle royal is the best
recommended
its arma not call of duty or battlefield or halo or whatever its simulation so no 360quickscope no genderrelated bashing no noobs vs pro to a certain degree simply one of the best simulations game in existence its basically a military simulations with multiplayers and good gameplay with multitudes of community mods with massive content created by community you buy this game you could play more than just 1 game yeah wanna play the sims arma 3 have it wanna play tank battle arma 3 have it wanna play ace combat arma 3 have it wanna play racing games arma 3 have it wanna play oh come on try them for yourself im not paid to write long review so im gonna leave it here oh and zombies hehe whats better than playing zombie in arma themed world download a zombie mod use a script to spawn tank and have fun

recommended
i have played over 500 hours on this game now omg since the first time i played this game every minute on it has been worth while the amound of different game modes on this game is endless altis life battle royal king of the hill and much more personally i enjoy altis life the best as i have found an amazing communtity to play with sawclannet this game is so fun and is worth every single penny the graphics on this game is amazing especially when you find yourself in the middle of nowhere the views are out of this world overall i reccomend this game as it can fill everybodys needs apart from some of the hakers that decide to ruin this game but every game has this this is one of the best games out there
recommended
arma 3 is a great addition to the franchise for the newer crowd as you can see i have only played arma 3 for 32 hours since march when i had purchased the reason for this is that i just cannot like this game the reason for this is that it lacks the feeling immersion of its predessesor arma 2 when i play arma 3 i feel like im playing a good game but not an arma game the immersion of the game is very poor comapred to its predessesor but its mechanics such as animationsounds etc are great while i have only played 32 hours of arma 3 i have played well over 3000 hours of arma 2 and its expansion oa and i can say with great confidence that if you enjoyed arma 2 you may or may not enjoy arma 3
recommended
this game brings realism to the world of fps even though when it was released it was some half finished piece of crap they have really turned it around with the help of the modding community if you want realism i would definitely recommend this game
recommended
spawn get in chopper get shot down by aimbot enemies repeat 1010
recommended
this game is just awesome ppl may complain its too expensive but they are rly wrong for what an arma game have and for what the community build for the game its a pretty cheap price you are paying expect to have hundreds of hours of gameplay because you wont master all the skills necessary to enjoy the full content of the game in just 10 hours this game is not for casual players
recommended
after recently playing a lot of arma ii mainly on the game modes island life and wasteland i decided that i absolutly must have this game and when it went on sale this summer sale 2014 i snatched it up right away and i can tell you i do not regret it a single bit wasteland is a little different to what i was used to on arma ii after only playing it for a short while but fun nethertheless zeus is where the game has really caught my attention read up on zeus and give it a shot you wont regret it if you want more depth to a shooter
recommended
lifelike graphics and immersion would give any veteran ptsd this game will turn anyone into a adrenaline junky instantly the realistic gameplay and balistics are punishing but at the same time very rewarding this third installment of bohemias army simulator set in the near future on an existing island offers tactical gameplay and is enjoyed best playing in a squad although lone wolfing can be done your survival chances will be smaller the base game includes access to multiplayer mods like battle royal wastelands king of the hill altis life and breaking point high replayability value and a mission editor for those who like scripting all makes arma3 worth your money requires a midhigh end pc to run properly the gameplay can be slow some mods dont run as well as others and suffer from desync it has a few bugs and glitches though nothing game breaking ive experienced so far the movement can feel clunky and the controlskeybindings may take a while getting used to as there are just so many i would reccomend arma3 to anyone who enjoys a serious militairy simulator
recommended
ive been waiting for a game like this my whole life without even knowning it quite possibly the best shooting game ever made
recommended
most realistic water ive seen
recommended
i drove a jeep for 10mins to get to where the fight was immediately after getting out of the jeep i died without even being able to fire a single shot let alone spot the one that was shooting at me

arma 3 is a very fun game to mess about on but it is quite hard to play seriosly as the ai are absolute  and becuase crashing into a fence at 2 kmh in a car kills you apart from this it is a very fun game to play on altis life but i wouldnt really recommend it that much who actually want to do millitary stuff on it
recommended
one of my favorite games the normal game modes and campaign are really good but the mods and other community content give this game very high replay value
recommended
awesome game lots of fun mods to play
recommended
najlepsza ze wszystkich arm ale ma dwa minusy mao broni nie ma chociaby strzelb okropna optymalizacja ale tak to nie ma nic w niej zego nawet ai daje rade ang the best of armas but there are 2 minuses lack of weapons no shotguns for example crappy optimalization overall its very good even the ai is not so bad
recommended
i used to have a job and friends now i have arma
recommended
if you like butt stuff you will like arma 3 all praise the booty
recommended
super fun to play with friends its very realistic and the graphics are great
recommended
might be a bit expensive but overall after buying it it was hella fun and can spend hours upon hours on it with all the mods and things to do
recommended
overall arma 3 is a great game once you get the controls down also get ready to die alot
recommended
the best game ever no joke although its tagged as a military simulator there is much more you can do the altis life rpg mod for example is the best game mode ive ever played bohemia have factored almost everything into this and made so much attention to detail its purely amazing although made on a 7 million budget this is way better than any other game on the market of course its confusing but it optimizes everything every key on your keyboard does something every animation has so much detail and the configuration settings are amazing even if your pc isnt the best youll still be able to run this fine which brings me to my next point the engine was made to be clunky so you can run this game at 25 fps and its quite tolerable the only problem ive found is it runs in 16bit colour mode when running on borderless windowed but that is nothing compared to how great the game actually is i have spent a small 60 hours playing this 57 of which were in the past two weeks according to my steam profile at the time i wrote this review i have had so much fun in this just as i was about to leave gaming altogether i bought this for 60 aud i dont regret it in essence if you have friends to play with and a halfdecent computer you will have so much fun on this game i recommend it to everyone this absolutely  on arma 2 dayz and any other type of game of similarity
recommended
this is the train simulator for all people wanting to invaid greece it has many civilians ready for you to dominate with such force as gun tank plane boat you can steal van and drive like niko in gta the bad guys in 300 deffinatly should of played this game before they tried to get sparta the best part is the plane so speed such sound wow
recommended
obviously youll know what youre getting into if youve played and had fun playing arma ii potenetial for some really fun mutliplayer experiences and a whole bunch of missions on the workshop to play on your own huge map and great game mechanics
recommended
this is war if you like military simulation games this is worth your money
recommended
i enjoy arma 3 most realistic military simulater i have played
recommended
best military game out there
recommended
get it
recommended
singleplayer is an exercise in pain on high difficulty game overwrites autosaves and limits you to 1 save prepare your body for an autosave with grenade launcher rounds inbound forcing you to restart great roguelikelike
recommended
\ this revue is for multiplayer only as there is no actual singleplayer content in this game this game is weeks of fun with your friends if you can spend hours to learn the keymapping and the demanding gameplay and it is years of fun if you can spend days to learn to use the complex mission editor for me the hugest content in a fps ever and features are still being added month after month
recommended
arma 3 is so good i dont have time to fully review it i just want to get back to playing
recommended
what an epic game i just tried the altis life mod so far and it blows me away awesome graphic really nice physics realistic textures wow however it has some minor and major bugs specially the mod it needs enormous computing power to play at high graphics glitches are common but after all it has huge potential i cant await to see more features of this game
recommended
1010 would get run over by car again
recommended
this game is pretty well done i would say this is in the top 20 games on steam it isnt fun as arma 2 but it definitely improves the way the game runs and the voice acting there are also tons of missions to download of the workshop i would have so say sniping in this game is my favorite i would rate this game a 710 on the game scale
recommended
one of the best war games out their but dont be fooled if fast paced action is for you then this game is not the onethis is a simulator which offers a lot of tatical elementsthe arma campaign is something ive enjoyed and because of the massive modding community theres always new content being released
recommended
very good game love it

this game is amazing if youve played arma 2 then you know what arma is all about if you havent then let me enlighten you the arma series is a 3rd and 1st person combat simulator with unlimited game modes such as breakingpoint dayz altis life and normal seize and secure objective missions jump in with millions of players and experience realism like never before and for all the fans of call of duty and the battlefield franchise your in luck because this game has campain for you to enjoy with no 360 no scope  strategize compromise and defeat your enemies one by one in this tactically realistic military simulator worth every penny
recommended

ive been playing this quite a bit its really pretty awesome if you like arma 2 you cant go wrong it fixed so many things that were wrong inventory system is great now movement and aiming arent clunky anymore and it has steam workshop which is awesome its worth buying i got it on sale but id gladly pay $60 for it
recommended
great game
recommended
severely underated game even with its growing popularity its still overlooked by many many people trying to get my friends to play it is a chore probably because theyre too pansy to make any effort to get through the learning curve
recommended
best war sim out there as of forever ago and forever on

one of the best fps games i have ever played

this game is gorgeous i love it get it as soon as you can
recommended
although its not for everyone id highly recommend considering a purchase of arma 3 if it seems like a interessing game to you its got tonns of depth and alot of replayabiltiy id also like to note that the game does have a hugley flexible editor which may be a big pull factor to anyone who enjoys creating their own scriptednonscripted missions to play and share using steamworkshop
recommended
arma iiis graphics are amazing the community made missions are awesome and the maps currently in the game are very pretty there isnt much to the vanilla singleplayer they are currently developing the campaign and have only released one episode of it so far but there are plenty of brilliant singleplayer and multiplayer missions available on the steam workshop they developers have done a great job at making this as realistic and immersive as possible rating 10 slithering snakes out of 10
recommended
shoot men
recommended
first things first this review is more like comparing to previous arma titles this game is massive with gigantic maps lots of venicles and weapons you will have lots of fun gameplay is more fluid than previous game graphics has been improved and look gorgeous and performes nicely there are lots of problems with cpu optimalization which can be fixed by startup command but still should be considered also there are tons of bugs but considering scale of things in this title it can be understood as previous instalments arma 3 comes with editor and is fully modable there is new stance adjustment system which is pretty usefull in close combat but glitches in physx not giving highly requested features in game and so on are serious problem which however can be fixed in patches you will not receive lots of missions like in previous titles but on workshop you can find lots of high quality mission which should compensate this in whole i recomend to buy arma 3 if you want tactical game which can be incredibly rewarding and punishing at the same time it still fells like original operation flashpoint but also fells lot improved for new players game plays lot diferently than other games you must think how to aprouch enemy and so on run n gun is not going to work here you must think in this game english is not my native language and therefore i apologize for all my mistakes in this review
recommended
worth it
recommended
arma 3 is a solid game over all still a little rough around the edges i give it 85 out of 10
recommended
if your into war games this is the one realistic and lots of fun with friends
recommended
awesome game needs some work on the scripting side of things
recommended
arma 3 is arguably the single most realistic and immersive experience you can find today it took me quite a while to get it running well however after its up and running you wont be able to put it down the maps are insanely huge allowing for intense tactics the realism of the guns is where this game really shines while some may complain that the kick is not entirely realistic you have to adjust the sights for distance if you get shot even once you will either be dead or have an injury such as a broken leg which only allows you to walk overall this game is a 9510 aside from some performance issues this game is nothing short of amazing
recommended
basicly the best game ever made
recommended
great war simulation game  i recommend it to all people who loves real action combat but you might need a decent config for it
recommended
this game is the best military simulation games and the best multiplayer gameplay i have played so far highly recomended
recommended
love all the mods its incredible how many scenarios you can be involved in
recommended
i am yet to find a more realistic shooter on the market this game offers tremendous entertainment conduct multiplayer operations online or with friends or play special operations missions in the singleplayer mode with massive upgrades from the previous installment of the series i dont recomend the game buy it now
recommended
this game is a must have if you like milsim it is very realistic and has a great community wasteland is for those who enjoy killing everyone in sight even if they are wearing the same camo deathmatch is meh coop missions are some of the best game modes if you are new to the series check this out the controls are a little strange at first but you will grow to love them
recommended
this game is a lot smoother and has much better gameplay than people give it credit for animations and stances as well as squadplay in this game are efficent and smooth the campaign is an epic story about your average foot soldier changing the way a war is playing out just by doing his part and staying alive i have played an extensive amount of multiplayer and campaign and i have to say that it is an experience most can enjoy if they pay attention while i literally cant say anything about the unfolding storyline without spoiling an entire episode of its three i will warn you and clarify that if you like explanations to everything this game is not for you you will be a sergeant a low ranking soldier with mind experiences and skills are his most effective tools this means he doesnt get the classified info of lets say a colonel or a brigadier general or the president absorb information and make your own conclusions because that spec ops captain over there sure as hell wont this game wont make any shortcuts for you to recap its story so you better keep your head up the whole way through the military strategies and plans carried out are phenominal and deserve a much bigger spotlight other than its famed multiplayer considering i got a solid 30 hours playing through the campaign alone i call that a big win let alone held up against todays standards hopefully you get a good picture of this games features and dont worry the campaign will help explain them as well happy hunting and dont forget survive adapt win
recommended
the best military simulator and sandbox game and with steam workshop that accessable downloadable and playable makes the mission editor becomes fun and unlimited to create your own and play some exciting scenario missions from other arma3 players mods and addons are ready to touch and try completed campaign [surviveadaptwin] about the story of kerry with the long story and unlimited optional opjectives that make players explore investigate and discover things around the island two amazing huge and mighty maps makes the battlefield looks awesome like no others these reasons can make you enjoy and spend times on this grandly beautiful game bohemia youre the best
recommended
this is such a great tactical game you get to play with players that want to play the game as if it was in real life so you get a truly great simulator expeirience do i recomend yes
recommended
so the campaign is complete a lot of folks are still having the bf4 or a3 discussion argument heres what i found a3 is not without its faults one of the biggest apects of the game is that its aimed at the thinker what i mean by that is that you have endless ways to achieve your goals but yes in being a milsim you can be taken out by a lucky shot from a guy you never saw with pinpoint ai targeting from 500yrds away for some folks thats the heart of endless frustration and this is not the game for you bf4 shouldnt be bashed either its simply for a group of folks that want action and eye candy  and it delivers on both of those in spades a3 has amazing visuals in my opinion yet they are harder to appreciate because so much tweaking is required to get decent fps while keeping some of the visual goodies its the fact that a3 is ridiculously hard sometimes and requires a huge time investment compared to most games that make it so satisfying when everything finally goes right a3 gives you a sense of accomplishment like no other when everything hits the fan and you or your teammates quick thinking pays off for a win being able to jump into almost any vehicle or aircraft leave you feeling that you can be the ultimate ____________ tank driver helo pilot fixed wing ace etc yes bf4 has some of these components but delivered in a completely different way run gun get shot a bunch of times hide heal and do it over again and thats completely ok if thats youre style of gameplay and what you enjoy a3 plan plan plan some more cross a huge amount of terrain that can literally take hours on foot and get shot by a dude you never saw or make the hard win you will dump huge amounts of time into a3 to be decent at it plenty of folks dont have that kind of time to commit bf4 get onplay for a match or two and leave if you want bf4 has some great dlcs the latest carrier edition looks awesome a3 has modafter modafter mod with a workshop full of missions horrible to great plus a community thats pretty engaging and helpful for me its a3 all the way
recommended
great milsim game cant wait to see it expand and grow into something much bigger

i still cannot believe that such an amazing and huge game is being created by a team so small  past me in some interview a3 is the best military game out there dont expect and easy win
recommended
this is a amazing game going from playing arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead is a brand new experiance this game has amazing graphics and amazing gameplay the only thing i miss is when diplomacy fails from arma 2 where you and some ai fight against another army and you have to control different locations to win but overall this game was worth the upgrade

drug runs shootouts to find a dog captured by a bdsm gang and who could forget swiming for so many kilometers that my finger hurt because someone crashed a boat these are some of the best insane moments i have had in arma 1010 would bang
recommended
really good game if you prefer a realistic slow phased fps game with a real feel of war this is the game for you insanely large map and plenty of different gamemodes to choose from there is also a nice rp server hosted by killernetworkgamingcouk where you can be a civilian or cop  choose to do real work or crime the possibilities of this game and its mods are endless looking forward for  dayz  mod also my recommendations
recommended
bought it back in april pretty bad gave it another shot in january holy  it is good the custom maps and content are amazingly fun and the campaign seems pretty good as well the games controls are horrifyingly complex and nonintuitive and the game intself can be a little buggy seeming but the combat realism and graphics are so sexy no shooter in recent years has provided me with the proper fear of that unseen sniper 800m away that arma 3 has 910
recommended
when operation flashpoint came out in 2002 i was pleasantly surprized that the bohemia interactive studio creators of the game managed to finally make a military simulation that surpassed all other competitors i still play it but its successors arma arma2 and now arma 3 take this sim to new heights as a us army combat veteran i can state from my military experience that arma 3 tops the list of all fps sims to date arma 3 involves teamwork selfdiscipline and developing strategy to defeat the enemy this sim is not for run and gun players
recommended
good sim where all mistakes are punished by death

1st game best grahpichs and features and mods and communicate

the community is trash its a mix of team killing autism and milsim faglords making  overly complicated as usual with arma games the optimization is absolute garbage and no matter what you do you wont hit 60fps consisstantly in online the guns feel great but have the impact of a pellet rifle especially the 9mm sidearm nato gets the story doesnt make sence but its arma you dont play it for the singleplayer i was very disapointed however that the singleplayer was not coop like in 2 the only way to make this game good is by a having a squad that fits you whether it be autistic milsims people who are just playing to  around or a mixture of both who is in your squad ultimatily deterimines your fun b mods mods mods mods the massive amount of weapon mods spices up the gameplay with familiar faces like the ar platform and ak platform rifles it makes the game much more realistic ironicly c having lots of patience good luck finding a server that is consitantly good that doesnt have faglord admins ive been banned for saying wat isntead of what asking someone to turn down their mic and using opfor weapons while playing as blufor 610 810 with mods be advised when you download mods even if its something as small as a retexture you will not be able to join 50% of the ing servers because arma doesnt like having us filthy modders join vanilla servers so the servers will be split and you will be getting upset because of the lack of a filter between vanilla only and mod friendly servers

dont know why steam did not record all of my arma 2 hours which was over 200 spent on it but arma 3 lives up to its expectations i have been playing it since alpha and even in alpha it was so much fun the mods are amazing cough breaking point cough and you can play as zeus lightning bolts for all

arma 3 arma the almighty miletary sim which may catch your eye with the immersive feel and the futuristic feel which i will get to later i feel that this is a good arma but not on the same par as arma 2 which can i tell you can be either a bag of  or alot of fun to play with bugs and  ai to some of the most action packed immersive combat you will experience to date arma 3 delivers what it sets out to do an invasion of a made up map and you need to help secure it sorry if you would class that as a spoiler there are few if any bugs and beautifull graphics great multiplayer improvement from arma 2 but as a fan of the series i am a bit dissapointed in bohemia with their choice of a futeristic feel which i dont personally like compared to modern combat if you are a laid back gamer you will still enjoy this title due to the community multiplayer beauty editor the editor is my favourite part of the game as it lets you be creative and put what you would want in a campaign mission into your own overall i would reccomend this game but if you are looking for an army sim go for arma 2 by far
recommended
if you like dayz kinda action and you are willing to rpg altis life mod for arma 3 is verry cool look up a good community and get your life going get a job pick apples peaches mine for iron copper salt and even diamonds become a criminal and pick process weed cocain or heroin become a cop arrest ppl search vehicles and hunt people that have a price on their head you can even become a rebel before you get a life on a server read the rules of a server the rules may vary on each server if you want to become a cop most of the time they want you whitelisted the server i play on the most serverfilter trinity join me
recommended
very good and realistic game it also gives you a lot of freedom  the whole islands of altis and stratis are yours to explore  if you are an arma fan you will not be dissapointed by arma 3  and if you are new to series well it makes a great introduction of arma franchise to you  55

best military simulation game ever made since ghost recon

brilliant best war simulator ever
recommended
worth every dime
recommended
its ing amazing really fun to play but has a bit of a learning curve can be hard tp play at time for people new to the arma series this game is a must buy for anyone who likes fps games
recommended
absolutely the best arma by far i just cant seem to stop playing it
recommended
buy this game now
recommended
this game is 1010 i love it definatly a big step from arma ii
recommended
good game and game play
recommended
very good game if you like pewpew sounds
recommended
ok lets face the facts this game is quite a bit of money but it is totaly worth it
recommended
what do i think of arma 3 well i have mixed emotions i belive its a good game but there are alot of reasons i dont play it as often first for it being the game coming out after the previous arma 2 i was expecting certian things to be added like better ai a physics engine and a much better map i think i expected a little to much some ups about the game is its fun yeah get it like srlsy
recommended
get this
recommended
best war simulation eva you can make your own war with the editor the story is good and the multiplayer awesome 5 stars 
recommended
good simulation kinda crazy with distance issues enemies can pretty much auto track a wider perspective would be cool too over all needs all the weapons you can find in battlefield 4 and you have youself a crazy awesome game best military simulation out there  side note way too many kids with no real military time trying to act like leaders they try to talk in police code that they see on tv  destroys the whole concept but its a crack load of fun
recommended
arma 3 is an extremelly time consuming fun experience you get to complete millitary missions that include driving tanks helicopters and more its the full experience to a millitary lifestyle with that you can also check out some of the other game modes that people have made i first tried out strattis life and island life these are simulations of a real life situation you need to make money to buy food and drinks buy a car maybe even air units you can even go into the dark side of the world and process cannabis or cocain the reward is high but the consequence is being arrested by the police there are also many other game modes that people have made and i would highly suggest getting this game
recommended
the real difference between the rest of many fps out there  one unique simulator series
recommended
at last bohemia interactive have got their military simulation you cant call it an fps because its so much more finally nailled the singleplayer is fine and without the game breaking bugs riddled within arma 2 there are also still many more updates to come and the latest one is focused on multiplayer the only thing that really annoys me though is that everytime a new update is released it negates all your save games this is is so much of a wind up that ive set steam not to update the game until ive finished the singleplayer campaign and solo missions is it really so much to ask considering the vast majority of games update perfectly well without rendering your savegame positions as useless another plus with this game is that its designed to be easily modded and with the steam workshop also added you can be sure the new missions campaigns etc etc will add many many more hours of engrossing gameplay look at the success of the day z mod for arma 2 for example dont expect to go running around expecting to shoot everything in sight this is a simulator where one headshot from an enemy will kill you on the spot you have to change your stances and find cover according to the situation you find yourself in and work closely with your squad as you work towards promotions which eventually give you full control over your troops and air land and sea units so im extremely glad to finally be able to recommend this 3rd instalment in the arma series there are still some bugs to be found but nothing signifigant thankfully and nothing to spoil your enjoyment one thing i didnt like is the price 3999 for a game that isnt finished yet i was lucky and got my version for 23 in a sale but charging full price for a game they admit isnt finished leaves a nasty taste in the mouth theyre not the worse culprits by any means galcom 3  76 for an alpha version before that it was planetary annihilation for nearly 100 that is a shameful way of marketing and steam censor any negative comments on the games discussion forum early access was set up to help small indie developers charge a small price to help then get funding to finish their game and get it beta tested for free at the same time so i find it deplorable that big publishers are using the system to charge grossly inflated prices for an unfinshed game plus these are games that are part of a well known and critically acclaimed franchise which are guaranteed to sell well anyway it seems steams reputation for integrity has been ditched fk the integrity just give us your money no matter how shady the marketing ploy which i think is a massive disappointment from somebody who has been a member and fan of steam for many years i wonder how long it will take them this time to close and delete this post  they seem to have moderators everywhere anyway bearing all this in mind on the nearly final game i can recommend this to anyone who like their games to be military simulations as opposed to your bog standard fps the ui is a bit too clunky but apart from that this is the best game of its type around there arent many because it takes a long time to achieve excellence in a genre which takes great pains to model everything on a modern battlefield as accuratetly as is possible bearing in mind its not entirely finished you might maybe hang on a little longer and buy it in a sale when by then it should be entirely done
recommended
best game ever like its so cool
recommended
some of the engagements you will get into on this game other games like battlefield attempt to pull off but do not come close to feel at all realistic as it does in this game would definitely reccomend
recommended
this is a great war simulator which suports realisim with real time 1st or 3rd person stratagy go it alone our with a squad of ais or players and i general great game
recommended
this is a great strategical military sandbox game its such a cool but  dont like the mod types like survive so we also need a zombie sandbox gamemod like dayz epochwe dont even have a mod like that that game is great for the altis life players so the only great thing of this game is altis life its the best rp mod  have ever seen so ppllzzz bohemia interactive add thing like dayz standalone or just add a expansion like the arma 2 operation arrowhead
recommended
arma might be a game with bugs but deep down its truthfully an amazing game when in multiplayer or in custom sp missions add all the user generated modifications and the game is amazing its my favourite fps even if it isnt run and gun but slow and tactical movement
recommended
less hollywood more tactics features and pros  3 campaigns  edit your own spmp missions  over 100 player online games including coop  huge map im not kidding  drivable vehicles including jets and submarines  massive mod community  impressive visuals  night and day cycle  encourages tactical executions get it wrong and youre all dead cons  steep learing curve  although the effects are good fire fights may not satisfy those who want a bf4 type experience  ai can be frustratingly dumb at times but are not bad most of the time  automatic spotting as far as im aware you cant manually spot an enemy note  tanks and helicopters may seem over powered this is because in real life they are it forces weaker forces to adjust their engagement methods to succeed hit and run could be one of them
recommended
a big improvement on the previous 2 shooting in the previous 2 games felt more like shooting a shotgun glued to the end of a broom stick arma 3 has a great shooting model and an actually genuinely good single player campaign
recommended
amazing game then i found breaking point and was blown away even more worth the buy
recommended
negative reviews fueled by angsty console junkies  off that they cant hipshoot and bunny hop everywhere if you really like unreal tournament style shooters go play something else if you think battlefield or call of duty is too hard core this game will hand you your  and send you back to the forums crying theres a reason some military groups use it as a training simulator its not for punk kids
recommended
military simulator with extremely large maps lots of different modes and vehicles spent a lot of time on breaking point mod its very fun and rewarding
recommended
rly funa looooot of game modes buy it
recommended
arma 3 so when i saw this game for the first time i thought that soon will release another excellent piece arma however the first disappointment was already in anticipation as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign but this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared but i will not criticize i must say that the guys from bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair etc graphically its a big shift but a new engine this could offer more the playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes despite this however it is compared arma i and ii step backward personally i think that would bohemia interactive could use a better future on the other hand however the campaign is excellent what more can i say final verdict arma iii is an improved forward but it is incredibly untapped potential if it bohemia interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor or even a new engine so it would be something completely different much better 810
recommended
i havent played it too much but i can safely say make some friends and make your friends get this cause its hella more fun when you have a group to play with
recommended
why u read my comment when u can play arma iii 
recommended
its great buy it now
recommended
this was very awesome fps games nice graphic and theres so many mode on it so its not easy to make you become bored so fun if u guys playing together with best friends or familys u guys must have this game ^_^v
recommended
this is a hardcore militry simulator you could roleplay from marines to navy seals and has an amazing editor and unlike arma 2 it has under water experince and submarines and way better graphics now i dont play many simulators but this is one of my favorits
recommended
its like the old days
recommended
good game hours of fun and hilarious times in multiplayer
recommended
what are you waiting for buy it
recommended
extreme fun for those who love anything military and like playing tactically i also highly reccommend it for the campaign which is very fun and gripping 910
recommended
running around aimlessly through miles of durkadurka land squinting your eyes for multiple hours trying to find something that moves once you do you find out that you need to reload your gun and you get shot a million and a half times i like this game it is fun
recommended
i played roleplaying and got harassed by a bunch of french guys it was fun
recommended
awesome game you could do a lot of things to play arma 3 your way many kinds of server and awesome singleplayer experience
recommended
takes a beastly computer to run professor cow phd
recommended
i will admit a fun game but do not buy now now for $60 and a lack of content this game does not deserve the cash especially since their already coming out with these dlc wait for the price to drop or for more things to be added in addition you better have a beast computer
recommended
best game ever  the best ofp you can find
recommended
buggy broken and at times chugs like thomas the tank engine still one of my favorite games in my library
recommended
when you dont get 10 fps its a great game 
recommended
perfect sim for those wanting something more than casual games such as cod or battlefield offer arma ii is still the big boy but 3 is shaping up to match or exceed the older but still massively popular sim the engine is a bit smoother and the setting more futuristic but other than that it plays very similar
recommended
this game is incredible
recommended
i gladly dropped part of my paycheck on this game and ever since its release it has kept me entertained through the various gamemodes it offers if you do happen to get tired of wasteland altis life etc you can check out armaholic and download many more mods and missions to work with the game does have its bugs but in reality every game does they may or may not get said bugs worked out but we can only hope if you want to screw around on a milsim that has many things to offer arma 3 is the game you want to pick up
recommended
the most strategic fps game i have ever played i love the game because it is filled with hard campain missions and an amazing multiplayer
recommended
amazing game good for pc gamers  fun and liitle bugs here and then but overall good game 
recommended
beast

best game of 2014 award goes to this withought question

while buggy at times i throughly enjoy this game it is an easy transition from arma ii and is a good buy for anyone who enjoyed arma ii 455
recommended
beast game if you have a comp to support it if not you can still sit in spawn and pretend you are doing something useful 1010
recommended
ma a you must buy da hood likes it
recommended
for all those people out there who think cod and battlefield are noch tactical enough arma 3 is the game of choice awesome multiplayer action for example in king of the hill and the great modifications breaking point altis life make this game my 1 at the moment
recommended
really really great game must have for all tactical shooter fans
recommended
theres something about bohemias worldbuilding that inspires people importantly though arma 3s vanilla content now stands on equal footing with those thirdparty inspirations its still a little rough around the edges but its a darned impressive package nonetheless
recommended
a very big improvement from arma 3 love playing battle royal fits pefectly with the controls might want to have a decent pc to not lag on arma 3 though if you liked arma 2 you will love arma 3 get it on sale
recommended
the multiplayer is really the ownly selling point for this game but the multiplayer is really fun depending on the type of server your on
recommended
this is an amazing game quit looking at these reviews and buy it already
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
operating operators operating operationally meets special needs children walking with their asscheeks

this is a 1st3rd person war simulation engine not quite a game on its own yet arma iii comes with very little content on its own and it is ripe with missing features and bugs but the guys over at bohemia interactive have been dilligent with patches features and support theres an entire website dedicated to live bug tracking and suggestions with feedback from the developers which is incredibly rare that being said many users still continually suffer from lag and crashes and the game has very high requirements to run and look nicely despite the missing bugs and features the game has all the core components of a strong simulation game the developers have done well on bullet physics and the graphics look really nice on max on the other hand the game is very complex and the controls will be difficult to pick up for new players your bullets are not lazers that hit your target immediately you will need to range your target adjust the sight on your gun to the appropriate distance and lead them appropriately to have a chance of hitting them unless youre under 300m away then let your inner call of duty player out the games built in content consists of scenarios and the recently added campaign the scenarios and tutorials are introductions into the various attributes of the game from flying helicopters to assault diving to artillerty strikes the campaign feels like a bunch of scenarios strung together and adds very little to the game all things considered the campaign is bad and you wont want to play or remember it for long but you dont buy this game for the single player the multiplayer game modes are what put this game head and shoulders above other similar multiplayer games players can join a wide variety of different game modes that are downloaded and installed automatically for the player before joining the server there are only two maps a large map that bogs down servers with its sheer size and a smaller map that doesnt bog down the servers as much just like in arma 2 there are many guides tools and tutorials provided and created by the community in order to produce new and diverse game modes and content the popular dayz mod will likely not exist in arma 3 because of the upcoming standalone installment but the wasteland mode offers the same scavengingsurvival mechanics sans zombies there are also deathmatches missions and rpg modes to cater to every type of player the call of duty crowd would probably get bored by the slow pace of the game the battlefield 4 crowd will have much more common ground but might dislike the lack of polish in the game the arma 2 crowd will enjoy the game my tips for starting to play in any game mode in any lobby in any situation where youre unsure in any situation where you have no clue whats going on ask questions the community is incredibly responsive and helpful they will know the game better than you and their help will mean the difference between all your shots going right over the enemys head or right into the enemys head adjust your scopes range with pgup and pgdown you should probably stay out of global voice chat use  and  to change your chat channel stick to the blue team channel if youre not sure where you should be talking
recommended
would recommend if you have a strong computer sounds are vastly improved over arma ii and combat is very great
recommended
with the new zeus dlc i honestly think that the future of rts is with this game if you have the hardware to run the game its a mustbuy its the only pc game out there thats actually a full military simulator rather than run and gun fps
recommended
this game fun for goofing around and fun cause it has so many modes and servers and big maps and good graphics
recommended
i do recomend this game but it has its flaws its a tone of fun and multiplayer is fantastic if you are willing to play a long time ussaly in multiplayer their are three types of game modes rpgplayer vs player or player vs ai in all three it takes some time getting used too their is a lot of walking and not always in your face combat like cod or bf4 its a simulator a really really buggy simulator and here is where the flaws come in the game is so buggy and poorly optimized it takes more hardware then is nesseary to run it at good fps people with some of the latest graphic cards and cpus still get low fps and the ai is horrible not as bad as arma 2 but its not great with a $100 grahics card and $100 cpu you can play this game on low graphics after tweaking it a bit tho but that being said the game is really fun still and defintaly worth your time if you are willing to put effort in learning how its played also you do not need this game for anything that deals with dayz dayz standalone does not need this game to run and for some reasion a lot of people thought this
recommended
much graphics such sunrays guns wow
recommended
probably the greatest fps game ever created completely unlike all other fps cod bf etc though awesome graphics awesome gameplay and awesome realism
recommended
its ok kinda laggy hopefully they optomize for midend computers in the future
recommended
arma 3 is fun
recommended
this game is epic
recommended
excellent game very easy to interact with the enviroment with the many poses etc
recommended
what can i say this is arma 3 perfect in every sense best thing about arma games are their mods altis life breaking point king of the hill battle royaleetc you name the kind of gameplay you want and it is available out there the bonus is that this game is optimized properly as opposed to arma 2 the new engine in arma 3 makes the graphics look real definietly recommend this
recommended
i was never a big fan of simulators let alone military simulators but the first time i played arma 2 i fell in love although i never bought arma 2 i did buy arma 3 and holy crap was it amazing amazing graphics an amazing aresnal and an amazing game there is many glitches and long waits to do a mission but you can see through that and notice the beauty arma 3 gives there is many fun game modes and even mods to spruce up the adventure so pick up a gun a helmet and get out there solider
recommended
i would buy this but i dont have money
recommended
hours of entertainment
recommended
this game is plagued with awful optimization issues that make the game practically unplayable in certain mods for example in wasteland one of the more popular mods out there the game will literally crash my entire pc every 1015 mins i do not have this problem with any other game and have run stress tests on my pc several times arma has had optimization issues since alpha and this really needs to be looked at for radeon card owners like me hd 6870 ive done everything from reinstalling drivers to amping up the fan speed to maintain at a very reasonable 60c chances are you wont run into this problem but then again you might and if you do youre in for a world of frustration i dont have problem is most other modes this game is very finnicky and like i said there are some optimization issues as people with weaker specs may be able to run the game better than someone who meetsexceeds recommended specs most of my friends have also experienced a couple of crashes in their time with arma 3 so crashes are not at all a rare occurence in arma from my experience do i recommend this game hard to say mods like wasteland and city life are what really make this game worthwhile and theres a half decent campaign going for it grab it at a discount but dont pay full price overall 7510
recommended
great open world tactical combat game buy it and team up with some friends and kick 
recommended
arma 3 is a eagerly welcomed upgrade from arma 2 the new stance system upgraded engine and water gameplay truly helps you experience the life of a military operator the best part is that the modding community is stronger than it was for arma 2 with mods ranging to advanced ai to weapon resting and custom gear to real world weapons this game does everything better arma is the only game youre going to find where its a good idea to find youre grandpas old army handbooks
recommended
really fun game to play with friends many gamemodesmission files to choose from great community 
recommended
its really wel doneawsome game
recommended
this game for real man not for kid
recommended
if you can get past the bugs and community this title will surely leave you satisfied without costing an arm and a leg when do i get paid
recommended
as a veteran of arma 2 and its expansions i was fairly eager to get my hands on this game however upon playing arma 3 i found the game lacking particularly in its lack of variety unlike its predecessor arma 3 only hosts a handfull of units and vehicles with each side getting a tank two or so helicopters and a few light vehicles and apcs the same goes for the available weaponry in the game although this part is balanced out by a wonderful ability to customize most rifles and machine guns with a list of accessories ranging anywhere from red dots and holo sights to infrared lasers and tac lights arma 3 does include a fairly detailed campaign as well the campaign allows for an open experience by allowing to choose between what patrols to take priority over and actually allows for the player to simply leave camp and initiate a solo patrol all weapons gear etc are saved when returning from each patrol meaning that what you come back with sticks with you until you change your loadout otherwise however since arma 3s campaign was incomplete upon release date those luxuries are short lived being incomplete the updates that finished the campaign make it inconsistant in its mechanics and by part 3 the whole idea of fob based warfare is forgotten along with loadout customization some could even debate wether the campaign is even yet completed or not since the final mission and epilogue are reminiscant of arma 2s eagle wing but despite its dissapointments and setbacks arma 3 still offers perhaps the most advanced war sim on the market this and the active modding community that easily fills in whatever the game lacks in make arma 3 a worthwhile buy
recommended
great game if you played arma 2 then you have to play arma 3 even if you havent play it for the explosions i would seriously recommend you add this to your library
recommended
the controls are doo doo but with friends this game can be pretty fun
recommended
good game to play single or multiplayer plenty to do in it
recommended
this is ing awsomeeee
recommended
this game is able 1010
recommended
fun and realistic combat simulator strong lurning curve but when you start to learn it you can have alot of fun i strongly recommend to people who like realistic games
recommended
iranian s think they can talk  about the usa allright then ill shoot you with all the content this game dosent have
recommended
pretty awesome stuff but a huge lack in content still waiting for the update from bohemia that will finally add more guns and vehicles 1010 would recommend just keep in mind its supposed to be a military simulation game so it is a little tricky
recommended
lets start off by saying that this game is great totaly worth all the money now this games does have its flaws the controls are hard to get used to almost every key on the keyboard is used for something or multiple things also the game engine is broken if you want this game you need to have one heack of a pc on single player full graphics usually runs nice for me i do have a gtx geforce 660 ti and a 433 ghz prosseser but sometimes on single player there are massive framerate drops on multiplayer running as low as this game goes im getting about 2030 fps but not always and now lets get to some more good things the vide and screen shots dont seem to capture what this game can really do you can build your own battles so much to do in multiplayer like regular battles to survivals to get a jjob make money and live your life out with the need to buy guns and fight the rebles and the cops or be a reble or a cop the underwater diving and submariens are fun there is litearaly so so so many gear types clothes back packs guns attachments and alot more so yes i do highly recomend this game but only if you have the pc for it
recommended
a very incredible game super realistic with the ability to add community made mods it just adds that much more to the scope of the game now with the zeus functionality which allows players to edit missions on the fly it makes mission creation that much easier this series is a game that every harcore military gamer should have in their library the only negative to this game is the fps drop when too many units are in an area but thats about the only negative that i can think of
recommended
a beautiful game really well made good graphics and nice gameplay i strongly recommend trying the zeus game
recommended
best fps by a longshot that simple
recommended
arma is the best game ever will soak up hundreds of hours with ease
recommended
as long as you have a good pc that can run the game well you are going to have lots of fun
recommended
what is love baby dont hurt me dont hurt me no more
recommended
good game for the $$
recommended
to be honest ive no idea what this game is about but whatever it is it feels great i didnt have much time to play yet but once ive sat with it i didnt notice how fast the time flies 6 hours gone like a few minutes also the multiplayer can be confusing at first as there seems to be not much predefined game modes but if you have friends playing it its a must have
recommended
one of the best game sive played this year would definetly recommend if you dont mind the occasional bugged death
recommended
i reccomend only if you have a computer that can handle it also the controlls arnt easy
recommended
this game is just amazing it is a game that requires a big big computer but it looks fantastic as soon as you get the computer i may have only killed one person but this game is just really fun coop sandbox tdm rpg and so on
recommended
if you are into military scenarios this game is great for you with the new engine and actual physics aspects it takes a big leap forward for the arma series for me it has been an amazing trip from alpha into the upcoming release an was not in any way a dissapointment i cant wait for jets d
recommended
omg so realistic even the grases moves unlike cod lol buy the premium edition for your special skull camo and ac130 killstreak srsly tho it is a good game get if you think your graphics card wont melt on ultra lul
recommended
its just so great to play havent been playing on my computer cause i cant play it on this one but ive been playing it on my friends pc and it ran fine just play and youll see that is fun realistic is one of the things that is well made in this game to man i liked it since i saw the first trailer
recommended
this is one the best combat simulators ive ever played the sand box on here is a blast and the steam work shop is awesome for user created content the only down fall for me is that i dont have anyone to play this with
recommended
good game but needs more modes
recommended
oh yes arma 3 one of my favorite games on steam i dont have almost 300 hours on it for nothing this is a military simulation game that is set around 2025 but they did not over do it and set it in the future where theres space ships and all that even know it does not feel like the arma 2 in the way that it is not feeling like it is a true military game with all the tactics that arma 2 had but other than that one problem that i have lack of content to it turned out to be a very fun game that me and my friends love to play so much to do as in multiplayer steam workshop with so much into it you can even get creative with it like my hunger games mission all in all very fun
recommended
really good game physics are preatty sick too major upgrade from arma 2  needs a few more weapons and vehicles maybe a bluefor transport apc need to fix the constant lag spikes when people are using custom weapons drove me insane in arma 2 and this one aswell but over all good game
recommended
great game much better than arma 2 i recommend capture island game mode
recommended
this is one of the best games that i have ever played i hope you come and join the game its really fun also the graphics and some more realism into the game from its previous arma 2
recommended
yeah except due to other campaign glitches we cant even make it to part 2
recommended
great game especially sandbox and the zombie mods its addictive like crack is
recommended
arma 3 good game good graphics amazing variety of gameplay gamemodes like coop wasteland altis and stratis life rpg and an epic campaign there are still a few bugs here and there but actually they make the game funny if my review didnt help you then check some videos of gameplay on youtube there are a lot of them i recomend this game a lot

well where to start first off hard this game is almost insultingly hard the ai lets you know youre boned when the tubes start bellowing out 40mm grenades in your direction sometimes they ing cheat and i tell you they cheat hard its a fun as hell challenge and i can usually go over 50 kills without getting wiped but sometimes they barely see you over a hilltop or around a tree and light you up like no tomorrow this game needs further optimization however i can run some pretty insane visuals on other game and even have gigantic openworld games like just cause 2 maxed out but this one i need to scale down a bit to keep a steady 4050fps while still keeping respectable visuals the weapons are diverse and accurate but not realistic enough in one simple aspect youve got all these buttons and lights on a titan for instance to make it fire like a javelinstyle launcher [shoot up go high slam down] but no way to actually make it do this this needs to be added launching with a topattack would help with one person say me with a laser designator marking an enemy vehicle on the other side of a hill for an ally with said launcher the mods are nice some are even well made duws comes to mind

the game is still buggy but it doesnt stop the fun to be had here if you are a fan of dayz then you will love the wasteland mod that is very popular in the arma series arma 3 does have a campaign mode but that is only the beginning modders have made this one of the most infinitely replayable games on steam there are hundreds of downloadable missions to play and a community that is willing to teach you how to play them i cant recommend this game enough if you like games like red orchestra and socom then this is the game for you it might be 60 bucks but in my opinion it is worth it i have put over 100 hours in this game and feel like i have barely scratched the surface tldr just buy it
recommended
im having a lot of fun with this game i have been sucked into this altis life rpg world where you can choose to live as a law following civilian drug dealer cop medic and more so cool

arma 3 is a game that focuses on realism without sacrificing all the fun what you get with the game multiplayer many mods or to be more accurate missions with scripts are out there like wasteland dayz the mod not the standalone game cti capturetheisland which is like a conquest mode from battlefield with a huge map and arma gameplay domination which is fairly similar only its against ai competitive multiplayer what this means is that you can experience the real arma experience what this means is joining up with clans and operating as a team as a real army would this in my opinion is the definitive way to play arma3 clans like this are things like httpwwwreacheliteforcescom  look it up if interested there are many clans out there just browse the steamcommunity arma3 forums like a dozen showcases which show and demonstrate the new features of arma3 around a dozen challenges firing drills to where you can compete for a better time or train 3 campaigns each around 34 hours long note only one of them is out so far second campaign comes on jan 21st editor where you can do what the hell you want and can create your own missions or scenarios steam workshop missions download missions made by other players with a click and around two seconds and play them rate them hundreds of missions are on steam workshops plenty to choose from be adviced however this game can be a pretty damn big machine hog you need a pretty decent to pc to play this game appropriately even more so for the multiplayer
recommended
pretty damn good make for sure you have a good gaming pc before buying

the worlds one and only military simulation game  if you want an awesome teambased and realistic military simulation this is the only right choice for you  nothing for soloplayer like cod or battlefield  this is not kill on sight and its not an egoshooter or arcadeshooterits a military simulationthere is no space for rambos  if you are a lone wolf and think you could kill an enemy squad alone or somethingthey will show you are wrong you cant survive more than max 35 bullets based on your hitzones  arma 3  this is war
recommended
solid single player campaign so far and the multitude of community missions means your hard pressed to run out of new missions to play but this game really shines when it comes to large coop missions i also recommend samatras version of the wasteland mission over the others
recommended
best army game of all time 100% reccommended soon will buy arma 4 when realeasd 
recommended
possiblt the most realistic fps up to date
recommended
its a game with the stuff inside
recommended
i havent been addicted to a video game in a long time on my first day i somehow lost track of time and end up playing for 17 hours straight this game has unlimited protential i love it best game since operation flashpointresistance
recommended
arma 3 is the bbbeeesssttttt
recommended
definitely worth buying ing great military simulator that beats cod and bf into the ground lots of fun mods and gamemodes makes this the perfect game
recommended
i would fully recommend this game it is fun and amazing who ever is a fan of realism shooters this will be it i have been a fan of arma all the way from the beginning from the first games that was operation flashpoint to where it is today with arma you will have hours of fun whether it is building missions messing around in the editor or downloading the countless mods that are available on workshop and armaholiccom would fully recommend 1010
recommended
such milsim many games much fun so arma
recommended
the most realistic army simulator ever created
recommended
i have autism and i recommend this game
recommended
review timemost realistic gamecannot even jump this gamekillslick plays it ofc
recommended
arma 3 is good game but its not like common run and shoot game like cod or bf since arma 3 was made more like a simulator than a normal game the controls is a bit spesific you wouldnt understand it if not played it before but you will learn it quite fast the graphics is great but not the best the details though is very well done the gameplay arma 3 is a game you will probably either love or hate in the sigleplayer you get to do almost whatever you would like to from diving and desarming mines to defending towns in badass helicopters the multiplayer can also be amazing team up with a couple of friends and you got it thats some hours you will probably never regret spending now there are som bugs and all of that but screw them if you like detailed and huge maps arma 3 is for you if you like realstic shooters arma 3 is for you and if you love having a good time with friends driving around in various vehicles mowing down stuff this game is deffinitly for you
recommended
an amazing step up from arma 2 with better graphics and smoother gameplay while still retaining the core principles that make arma what it is now with the first part of the campaign released it finally feels like the complete package with a gripping and interesting story if you in any way enjoyed arma 2 then buy this because you wont be dissapointed
recommended
really fun but a different kind of fun than your typical shooter this is about planning bringing the right gear the right friends the right objectives and trying to execute the plan even with the ai on the lowest possible setting theyre geniuses compared to any other shooter out there take your time be patient and work your way through the objective fun under the right circumstances
recommended
you love war you will love this 
recommended
awesome warfare sandbox you can do so many missions created by the community single player multiplayer vs and coop graphics are fantastic controls are very well set physics are phenomenal this is the king of all milsim fps all i wish is that i had more hours a day to be able to play this game
recommended
this is defenently a work in proggress but with a leap in animations from arma 2 but still requires jets planes and more variety of cars and classes with an ability to customize your firearm
recommended
play the breaking point mod the survival and pvp aspect of the game make it a real challenge to survive great fun for those looking for a realistic survival game
recommended
so in depth it makes cod look like pacman
recommended
a great game for military enthusiasts those looking for a run and gun experience similar to cod or battlefield should look elsewhere though its tough and unforgiving at first but when the games mechanics click into place it becomes a tactical battle the game is great for its multiplayer components and the modding community keep releasing some fantastic mini campaigns and scenarios the world is huge and the selection of vehicles and weapons gives enough diversity to keep the game fresh theres a lot of running and moments where nothing much happens but this gives you time to admire the impressive graphics and vistas that are on show would highly recommend to anyone looking for a patient realistic and tactical experience of warefare
recommended
outstanding 1010 for great action and simulation this sandbox brings more than creativity
recommended
its realistic very realistic so realistic you cant really jump or even bunnyhop but you can step over things which i guess is cool also guns
recommended
to put it simply the game i expected battlefield 3 to be battlefield 4 has a couple steps in the right direction but the series is no longer a tactical sim like bf2 i will forever miss jalabad but arma 3 has great mp thanks to the community more to come teased from bohemia right now i enjoy king of the hill wasteland breaking point much more finished than dayz standalone atm
recommended
this is an realy awesome intese game the best i ever played it has awesome graphics and has those intense moments that can make you jump of your seat it is a verry serious game and you will find many pepole who want to work together but also many trolls if you dont got it u dont live
recommended
a completely worth buying masterpiece the most attractive part is its campaign missions it is better than arma2s missions which got so much vehiclemanipulating requirement with meaningless keyboard controlling and neglected a lot of fun of infantry combat to be honest i dont have any interest in jet or heli driving we got other brilliant games to do this part all i want is intense infantry combat work in a team or group sweep some hostile village rescue our crews snipe some enemies and fall back etc arma3s campaign is doing well this time i just completed the first chapter survival and i gotta say i was having great fun of it it nearly achieved all of my expectation for now and the second chapter is still amazing im playing the first part of it just release more infantry missions no more ing heli or jet
recommended
me and my friend were driving along in a truck i asked my friend are there any tanks in arma 3 he replies tanks in this game are like unicorns you get them if you wish for them a minute later we come across a tank parked at the side of the road hmm did i just get my wish granted we get out and inspect the tank it appears to be not occupied we turn to leave and hear a sound suddenly we are both shot in the back as i lay there with my life slowly draining out of me i see the tank blow up our truck and drive away goddamm it why did i have to wish for my stupid unicorn then i respawned 1010 would wish for unicorn again

as i was walking through the woods after  went to hell thinking we were finally safe my team leader stepped on a landmine and exploded before my eyes someone over the radio said jesus are you alright are you hurt my character replied yeah  i mean no yes im fine before immediately stepping on a landmine and exploding ive only been playing this game for an hour but im already hooked definitely worth it just hope i can figure out how to read a map
recommended
i dont even own this game but its so good that i have transcended the mortal boundaries of steam to write this >starts a campaign game >instantly sniped by ai in the first fight >reload save game >rinse and repeat its a very good military sandbox trust me its worth the weight
recommended
arma 3 is a great military simulation game very realistic and the graphics look incredible the game has a ton of gameplay possibilities and options huge amounts of content and modding keep in mind you need a good system to run this game at a decent frame rate with highultra settings overall score 910
recommended
visually striking but thinly scripted overwhelmed by digital effects and a bland impersonal story bogged down in a cliched romantic subplot and will bore annoy and disgust audiences of nearly every other persuasion lazily assembled comedy
recommended
this game is one of the best games i have played with my friends i played 500 hours in total from the game by it self with no mods and another 30 from breaking point when more mods come out i am probly going to play another 500 hours

this game is really a great combat simulator its one of my all time favorites and i do highly recommend this game to anyone that likes combat or army games
recommended
this game is a super realistic simulation and yes there are game breaking bugs but in its core you have an excellent made game with good mechanics and well made design its definitevely worth a buy especially if you are a fan of getting 1 shot from a sniper in a hill you werent even aware it was there yeah you get the point its super realistic you wont be surviving more than 3 shots to the chest and 1 shot in the face from any weapon will kill you
recommended
this game is amazing its like 6 or 7 games in onewith all the mods you can play with this game makes this game so worth the moneynever have i played a rp shooter but its so epic
recommended
great game if you can afford it buy it

great graphicssound solid gameplay for the most part that aside most def recommend to get this gamethe game itself is awesomethe mods just add to the experience
recommended
get it now meow
recommended
arma 3 has a lot of detail when it comes to its graphics which is good but it can also have some bad points although it is realistic half the time you cant see your enemies because the sun is in your way a massive problem with arma 3 is the ai they are totally unrealistic i once used a sniper to shoot at an ai who took cover on the ground and as it was long distance i missed using a sniper he stood up and returned fire hitting me with about 3 of his 4 shots at the distance he shot at it would be impossible with an assault rifle ive never really found arma as a game i would play by myself because it becomes boring and repetitive especially when you keep dying and most of the game consists of travelling to the battle i like arma 3 and i would suggest it to everbody because you can have some good times on it but the game itself needs to have a lot of work for it to be a game i would consistantly play
recommended
runs very welll on low end computers and high i find this a very grapical game of fun and open world exploration along with mods of sorts from planes to guns very well made game graphics beat xbox type games crank it up on high and have fun
recommended
great military sim far better than arma 2 although there arnt as many vehicles as i liked runs better than arma 2 beacuase of the new engine which allows alot of people to have fun and run smoother i will be spending alot of time in this game and i recomend it for anyone that actully values a good military battle instead of something like call of duty
recommended
never have i felt such an exhilaration firing 30 556mm rounds at a bunny i thought was a person through my thermal scope at 800m

rant about why i enjoy the game great game i love the campaign so far user made content is brilliant and so far my favorite multiplayer game mode is king of the hill  3 teams fight for one objective its nice because it has a leveling system and saves your level and gear i also enjoy wasteland a gamemode where players have to fend for themselves or band together and build massive  shaped forts just kidding but if that was an option itd probably happen wasteland is a nice gamemode because there are tons of vehicles just lyin about loaded with guns and ammo and the moment you get near it an attack helicopter piloted by ai swoops in to say hello at least thats how one of my many lives went ai dont roam freely in wasteland but are side objectives in the game and if you kill all of them you could get anything from a box with guns in it to a helicopter loaded to the max with missiles and bullets but of course it doesnt have fuel so fresh spawns cant roll up and steal your helo while you are taking out the ai guarding it cons  ai can be a bit tricky to deal with making campaign a pain in the  at times  ai take a moment to ragdoll upon death and i find myself empying half a magazine directly into them not realizing that theyve died  vehicle mechanics could be better although they arent terrible  vaulting i find myself vaulting my way through objects and into rocks and all sors of terrible things like that not sure why devs didnt add jumping or something with less potential to cause problems overall is it a bad game  no i love it even though it doesnt have the best mechanics cough vaulting but if you are looking for a nice singleplayer experience i wouldnt necessarily reccomend the game to you unless you plan on spending hours raging at the ai in campaign although the campaign is quite amazing in itself it is also quite challenging basically if you want to get the game get it if you have a few friends or if youd like to make a few on multiplayer otherwise maybe not the best game for you i bought the game after playing a little bit of arma ii on my uncles pc i enjoyed it but the ai were overpowered and i saw that this was coming out so i took a go at it and really enjoyed it and i think you probably will too side note i typed this all at 846 am after staying up all night im going to enjoy reading this later when im in my normal mind

arma 3 is an amazing game it offers a lot of gamemodes and that makes this game incredibly fun to play over the past two weeks i have become addicted to arma in a good way  so where are you waiting for buy it already
recommended
very interesting and realistic game 910
recommended
this game is great not only does it have a great campaign and editor it offers multiplayer it is 10x better playing online with friends and if you ever do get bored with the vanilla game there are mods a lot of them too you can also download so many different mods there are downloads for missions guns cars and a whole lot more there are also different game modes and scenarios that change how you play the game this is by far one of my favorite games so i truly do recommend this game
recommended
the best military sim out there
recommended
best game i have ever played and highley recommend this game
recommended
i have a fx8350 and an r9 270x oc on singleplayer ultra i get around 4070 fps avg 50 render distance at 2500 multiplayer gamemodes with persistance high 1530 fps render distance 1000 severs without persistance around 45fps veryhighultra render distance 1500 there are other mods like breaking point and chenarus that are persistant but i run 80 player servers at 40fps ultra but this game base is mostly persistant servers with 60 people so i suggest a must buy if you have a i5 or i7 cpu and a nvidia gpu if you have a amd rig buy with caution but further than specs this game is really well crafted and is a magnificent game there is nothing like it on the marketplace at times it is a little unrealistic with weapon sway and op npcs btu past that pvp is awesome the mods are awesome 100% must buy for multiplayer

the life serversmods can make you spend way too many hours infront of your pc if you like i bought arma ii first arma iii is just an perfect sequel 1010 xar

very good game
recommended
while this game had some major bugs at the begining it has started to smooth out to be one of the best simulators of all time lets start out with the actual simulation well you are defaulted to be in first person everytime you spawn but you can go to third person if you have the keys binded there is bullet drop weather vehicles weaponsnot real time weapons and lots of customization options for your soldier there is tons of fatigues and weapons to choose from if youre playing vanilla now if youre playing with mods in your game you are going to have a even better time playing mods can help with ai and add new clothes for your soldier ig helmets vests facial protection and fatiuges just a really big tip is if you dont have anyone to play with on this game find a milsim unit and i guarentee you wont be bored 1010 would join milsim unit again thx bohemia interactive
recommended
big and beautiful great military simulator i only recommend you have a mic and join into a clan server where you can take part in some very realistic and large scale operations
recommended
number 1 favorite game
recommended
not the best game in the world and when they launched it it didnt even feel finished this game is not worth $5999 if you have arma 2 unless you want better graphics or your a die hard military sim monkey now as for the sales which one is going on right now  2242014  its 40% off that makes it about $35 buy it this game has many diffrent mods just like arma 2 and if you dont have arma 2 dont buy it get this its $15 more so in all pros  better graphics more in dept for military sim monkeys cons price less mods higher pc specs  expected  worst graphics than arma 2 if you run on lowest still doesnt feel fully finished
recommended
if you like anyting military than this is the game for you there are tons of fun multiplayer game modes ranging from rpgs sandboxes and sector controls the single player is just as fun using player created missions and mods or you can spend hours just messing around in the simple to use misson editor the devs are great and keep supporting and updating it arma 3 is more like a platform than a game overall its one of the best games ive ever played and has the most content ive ever seen worth every penny
recommended
when i first played armaii i barely enjoyed the game nor did i stay for too long simply because i didnt like it coming to armaiii i felt a whole different experience a new environment like never before something attracted me to this game when i first played it during a free weekend a feeling of excitement fear and all sorts of emotions of that nature i felt like a real soldier in an actual militaristic environment months later when i actually bought it i got hooked again with the same elements as before here are some of the pros and cons after a good 15 hours on the game pros somewhat real life experience ie running actual stamina system based on how much weight you carry driving aiming and firing etc weaponry different types of ammo explosives range from mines to grenades launchers etc amazing teamwork vehicles both a third person shooter and a first person shooter cons unstable fps issues literally stay away from this game if you dont have a strong cpu since this game mainly focuses on more cpu power than gpu that vary depending on either campaign or multiplayer i seem to run better on multiplayer for some odd reason but sometimes its the same as single player on certain occasions such as driving you literally have to deal with it the lowest fps i get on ultra settings with a nvidia gtx 770 and i7 4770k is around 30 tops maybe a good 25 sometimes like i said when doing various tasks unreal physics at certain times so basically lets say you climb a 5 foot ladder inside a building and fall or you leap from a 15 foot distance from a flight of stair in general picture the size of 5 feet thats 60 inches jumping from this distance death yup and even a slight bump from the rear of a car can kill a player around a 1015 mph car can kill a player in this these are some small things to overlook by bi but still i face palm sometimes at the unreality of the physics difficult controls it took me some time to learn all of the controls and almost 5 minutes to figure out how to aim down the sights simple things like these can easily be overlooked but are for sure some of the things to know when coming into arma it aint easy to get into like call of duty or battlefield neutral comments one last thing to say is that this game can be a running simulator at times although you have to travel far distances sometimes on foot and waste a good amount of time the game provides a lush realistic environment that contributes the beauty of nature it compensates for all the running that has to be done but allows you to explore the wilderness of a massive island all in all this is my review for the game tldr good military sim one of the best out there gives you good feels but lacks on certain parts a deal with the graphical issues game
recommended
arma 3 is a great game that deserves more attention the only downside is that you need a jet engine to run this game 1010
recommended
something between americas army and battlefield this game gives me what i need regarding realism and graphic design the performance on custom missions definitely needs improvement  sadly nothing seems to be happening anymore either way i recommend
recommended
its the most accurate realisticapart from wildlife in the game and versatile military simulator ive ever let my eyes on i will even go that far to say its the best military simulator that man has ever made
recommended
call of dutiers gonna hate
recommended
wow where to start wait i know lets put it in a list heres some of the things i like 1 the graphics are amazing 2 the multiplayer is not buggy and it all works fluently and without bugs and glitches and it is impossible not to enjoy every second of being connected to a server 3 all of the game mechanics work fluently and the animations never bug out 4 the sounds are all good quality and you cant hear white noise in the background for the voice recording so all of that is good quality 5 the parralax effects and occulent occlusion and bloom always look perfect and the effects all add up to high quality audio to make the perfect immersion but most of all its fun i run into a building kill two guys downstairs with my katiba carbine and move upstairs at a slow pace and i find another guy so i shoot him in the head and i take his lynx sniper rife and look out onto the streets below i look about 40 meters down the street and see a guy getting out of a truck so i shoot him and then his friend comes into the same building as me so i hide on the balcony and camp the stairs getting ready to shoot him when i take a shot to my back because someone in an adjacent building had shot me with his handgun at this point i turn round and the other guy comes up the stairs and gets the killing shot on me so when i die i see a viwe of my body from above and see the guy that killed me gets shot at with an rpg and the entire building falls down 1010 for graphics 1010 for realism and 1010 for a good community full of dedicated gamers who take the game seriously and you know that when you play this game you are playing in a generally friendly environment awesome
recommended
this is game for the real men

the ultimate military simulation vast open landscapes complete battle immersion and so many singleplayer and multiplayer gamemodesscenariosmodsmissions to choose from great with friends in coop against the ai in dynamic skirmishes across the island or teamed up online against the human enemy in king of the hill runs like  but its arma so i really really dont care 5

people need to get this game
recommended
its good if u have at least one person to play with and even better with more may take a little while to learn controls but the essentials arent that complex there are some missions to help u understand how to play though
recommended
reccomended for people who like tactical realism not recomended for peopole who like fps games that dont simulate the army like cod
recommended
this game requires a good pc my pc is a decent pc with a brand new graphics card and it is still struggling a little to run this game but it is deffinitaly a good game
recommended
this is a huge improvement over arma 2 the visuals the gameplay everything is better theres a considerable amount of mods for this already and the ingame editor is great for making your own missions i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great military simulatorsandbox

very interesting game teaches us about drugs and guns

great great fun this is the ultimate military simulator and the mods and community developed missions add only more to it highly recommended to any serious war gamer whos not looking for a fps style shooter like cod or battlefield

great game very realistic the only downside is that it needs better optimization
recommended
8510 a brilliant game for anyone who wants a realistic and immersive warfare game ive been with this game since the alpha and enjoyed every moment pros long and detailed campaign with a good story varying multiplayer for all players large mod base for improving or extending the game large amount of customization for the player loadout and weapons immersive and realistic gameplay stunning graphics see cons for exceptions extremely large terrains for gameplay cons some of the audio is slightly unrealistic such as explosions can be fixed with mods such as speed of sound pure particle effects are a let down for the graphics there is not a massive amount of weapons available in the vanilla game there are many mods which add more weapons to the game personal opinions some people may disagree with these
recommended
its a great game but you do need someone to teach you the basics because its pretty complex the only major bad thing is when you shoot at someone and they die its very awkward if you dont know what i mean watch some youtube videos about arma 3 and watch people die awkwardly
recommended
cant join any servers anymore 1010 wouldnt join again
recommended
arma 3 is a wonderfully developed title from bohemia i can honestly say it is one of my all time pc favourites it comes with full campaign map editor multiplayer modes great mods a fantastic and active community yes this game truly offers it all i would genuinley recommend this to anyone from the casual mess around gamer to the most hardcore military simulation fan this game is all around fun you can use features such as the map editor to create realistic raids battles and live scenarios or simply use it to fly around in shoot at people or have yourself a nice little airshow this game also has a fantastic control system truly giving you full control of your camera view player movement weapons and vehicles i would also recommend this especially to anyone who enjoyed arma 2 this is a perfect successor with more features more mods and my favourite improvement the animations if youre like me then you wouldnt have enjoyed some parts of arma 2 because the animations were dodgy glitchy and didnt always work quite right however youll love to know that these animation issues have been massively improved in arma 3 the animations work smoothly and look great doing it from scrambling inout of a jet to weapon recoil and player animations its all been fixed and now works at its true best to show everyone what the arma series is really like conclusion i would most definitley recommend this game to anyone casuals sim fans and all this game has the full package and is well worth the asking price and that cant be said for all games these days you get it all in one purchase so do yourself a favour and buy it i dont like using numbers but if i had to it would get a 9810 from me

shot a guy in a helicopter 1110 ign best game of the year

disappointed in the full release copypaste content between the factions static weapons launchers pretty much all vehicle turrets drones really kills it seriously 3 factions and all 3 of them use the same ataa launchers retextured uavugvs mraps have the same turret the 2 aa and mobile arty vehicles are just the same retextured turret on a tank base ai is still ridiculously stupid at huge ranges they are superhuman relying on pure aiming ability to be amazing but at close range often ignore you when youre in front of them blundering all over the place and eventually shooting the floor in front of you drivers crash into walls all the time tanks dont engage the way you ask them to gunners sometimes continually fire even though youd told them to hold fire many many times the action menu is still in disgusting and annoying optimisation is horrific as usual hundreds of square kilometers of map to play on but place down any more than 2030 individual squad groups and the game grinds down to a halt especially ruining multiplayer sure its pretty and altis is beautiful and the stances are a nice addition as is physx on vehicles but a lot of the major points they made got glossed over massively they said it was set in the future to allow artistic freedom whereas what weve got is altered modern day vehicles eg the merkava copy pasted turrets and retextures of just 1 model on some of the biggest new features sdv ugv uav quadrotor same launcher for most factions all staticsmortars the same for every faction same missiles on aircraft only 1 jet campaign not on release release was just altissome new vehicles basically to me it looks like they got lazy i hate that idea so instead i guess they must have run out of time copypasting turrets and vehicles and static weapons between the factions skimping on promised features and ignoring big issues to get altis out on the date they said they were going to they bit off more than they can chew and theyre still refusing to acknowledge this a real real real shame 610 game is wonderful but it could have been so much better if theyd just delayed their release a few months to actually finish the thing this crossed with arma 2s range of content plus actual optimisation would be a godly game
recommended
flopped over from bullet 1010 would flop
recommended
very good at what it does which is being a milsim youll be dissapointed if you buy this expecting it to be like any other fps best looking game of 2013 so far
recommended
worth its money by far great game

so i was playing bp breaking point had so much stuff friend shot me in face i died rip 2014
recommended
a true military simulator for the skilled player if you enjoy fps games like cod and battlefield but want to take a step up into the real gaming world this is your game
recommended
probably one of the best games if youre into military stuff and willing to invest some time at first you should also try to play this game in a group not only you will survive longer you will also have more fun 1010 set aside the bugs which are not really worth mentioning any longer
recommended
this game is awsome if you are looking for a military based game that is as real as a game can get then this game has your name writen all over it you need communication team work and strategy to win lone wolfing it or running guns blazin will fail like there is no tomorrow

so far its pretty much the best milsim out there bar none i do wish for a mod to include realistic reloading animations and a mechanic that recognizes bullets in the chamber negatives are the extreme amount of wasteland servers out there and complete lack of proper pvp servers that are friendly for playing without friends for better or worse unless you for some inexplicable reason actually like the wasteland mod youre better off playing the coop servers where its you 20 or so other folks customizable loadout ammo crates and places on the map to clear of enemy ai game looks good and its a real treat for such a milsim to look good and have alot of potential draw distance
recommended
devs have slightly increased multiplayer fps since the release the game engine sucks but arma 4 should be good if they develop a new engine
recommended
it is pretty good
recommended
100% worth every penny best game of 2013

arma is not a game in the same way that a word processor is not a document want to play callofdutylevel stuff its got that want to play rpg stuff its got that want to play survival horror its got that want to play a flight simulator its got that this softwares so good it will convince you to strap things to your head for headtracking and that this is perfectly normal however you will probably find you get the most out of this if you play with a clan from wewanttopretendwereinthearmy level of committment to the itssaturdayandweredrunkandontheinternet level of committment to the wehavesmallchildrenandthisiswhatwedotochillout levels of normality there are clans out there for anyones taste and needs and hell if youre a misanthrope the singleplayer fun is still pretty damn awesome httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvv1pxjdunqdg

great game love flying around in the jetshelis also love that theres going be a good variety of mods offered and being developed like arma ii had ie epoch battleroyal etc  only thing i dont recommend is getting the expensive dlcs theyre offering
recommended
arma 3 is bae
recommended
good pc buy arma 3 its worth it
recommended
i really do like this game as it has open world maps tons of content mods stuff like that i recommend this game because of all the features it has its overall a great game 1 problem fix the optimization i honestly have a pretty decent graphics card but from what ive read no matter what kind of computer you have its just not gonna work out @ 60fps ultra settings nope very high nope high nope medium no wtf is this bs low yes wtffffffff no one really wants to play a game that utterly looks like a pile of trash you know what i mean everyone says this game has poor optimization even if you have a super computer still doesnt work what is this bs all you need to need to do is update it for better fps so that no one needs a nasa computer to run this game ultra 1080p @60fps
recommended
overall a well rounded well put together game with a vast community whether its roleplay coop pvp or pve the community has made and played them all the game is constantly evolving and constantlly being tweaked and fixed the progression on the game from alpha to the latest version is by far some of the best work and dedication i have ever seen out of any dev teams even that of some triplea titles if youre looking for a serious gamestyle there are many different realizm groups around to show you the ropes if your more of a relaxed weekend warrior the winners of the make arma not war competion for multiplayer missions kink of the hill has what your blood thirsty hands are looking for from survival to out right blowing  up this is what your looking for
recommended
nice  best game ever 
recommended
moar realistic than real life
recommended
best addon game and better military simulrater
recommended
drove down a road and flew into a car and blew up 1110
recommended
my favorite game of all time its amazing and i certainly recomend everyone to play it tell your friends the only downside about this game is that you need quite a good internet connection for the online multiplayer servers but my connection is great
recommended
i have like 365 hours in this game in online mode and probably another 3040 in offline its a bit of a massive addiction i seriously plan missions when im supposed to be working if you like creating war campaigns youll spend more time in the editor than you will even playing the joy of letting a friend get slaughtered by your fair and balanced creations is just fantastic
recommended
amazing realistic shooter
recommended
brilliant game which has lots of unlocked potential it provides a platform to establish social links and is brilliant for making the game trully yours with its modability great fun and a great buy i highly reccommend this game
recommended
i cant fly nor do i like to annoy people only kidding i lurb arma
recommended
i trolled in global chat 1010
recommended
i love this game mods are the best way to make this game one of the best
recommended
this game is simply amazing i know the fps may be bad at stages and the bugs and glitches may be annoying but hey its arma a3 is an amazing game and even more amazing with mods never can i say i have seen another game where i can screech in my f18 super hornet over a bunch of isis militants in a fictional town in the middle east the multiplayer is simply amazing as well however buggy at times i did not enjoy the gameplay very much at the start but when i added the necessary mods it was a master piece 9810 tldr  pro amazing game with great core gameplay con minor and major bugs and fps issue tip accompanied with right mods it is a master piece
recommended
great game
recommended
ive had tons of fun in this game already and im far from done singleplayer can sometimes be a hassle ive come across a bunch of issues in missions forcing me to restart them but i suppose that goes for every advanced simulator if youre playing with friends youll never get bored any sandbox gamemode will do wasteland altis life invade & annex and so on this game does require an above average gaming computer
recommended
well after about 1200 someodd hours playing i haev to say arma 3 is a amazing game highly realistic really good ai that can be adjusted to your skill level allowing you to have a challenge but still making it enjoyable it is easy to personalize edit to your own preferances now modding is friggin awesome wait no it is friggin awesome if you want to see some of the content available go to wwwarmaholiccom it has all the mods addons and replacement packs to make your game better suited for yourself if you buy this game you will not be disappointed
recommended
a very underated game definitely deserves 85100 just take some getting use to and adjustments
recommended
big difference over arma 2 very fun and can be challenging online play is amazing
recommended
before playing this game you should ask yourself  what military operation would you like to play do you want to be a sniper do you want to be a part in a big combined arms operations do you want to ride a tank helicopter kart do you want to be a civilian and simply roleplay your wild dreams do you want to play as a god really there is not much to be said about arma that has not been said  yes there are bugs yes it is still a bit laggy but it gets better and it will get better because developers still update game and listen to fans feedback you can have hundreds of mods do whatever you want to do or simply follow missions it is all up to you this is main difference between other military shooters  it is a sandbox concept which means you are buying lot of games in one
recommended
great game so many game modes its hard to get bored
recommended
great game so many game modes its hard to get bored

[1010] fantastic game altis life hours of fun a great sequel to arma ii
recommended
arma 3 is an amazing game this game is great for anyone who likes shooters or rp games this game is one of the best first person3rd person games i have ever played i have played arma 2 and i have to say arma 3 is so much better than arma 2 the only problems about this games that really game to my attention is first off glitches theyre not too bad but they can get annoying every now and then also servers is a big problem there arent many servers out there for a variety of gamemodes the ones that i commonly see is deathmatch or battle royale breakingpoint king of the hill and some others but other than that this game is really fun and an enjoyable experience for players that are new or old to the 1st3rd person shooter genre i really recommend you get this game especially if youre coming from arma 2 or even battlefield thanks i hope i helped you out
recommended
now arma 3 is a awesome game but were here to talk about more than the fact its awesome graphics are amazing well the way i can run it arma 3 can bring someones fps to 100 depending on your comp so if it is lagging i highly suggest you lower the settings down alot what can you do on arma 3 you can do atlis life alot of role play it has a bank and cops so there you go battle royale hunger games but in arma 3 dayz brecking point arma 3 dayz mod now about brecking point its a pain just to login to it so i suggest you play atlis life and battle royale and it is a 1rst3rd person shooter i rather allways be in 3rd person for certin reasons that im not gonna disscuss there is alot more gamemodes but those are my things is it worth the money depending on your comp yes as allways my rateing for this game is 1010 remember this is all my opion so do not think its all here thanks for your time
recommended
as an arma veteran i personally recommend this game to anyone who likes the arma series
recommended
good game much wow 1010 would do it again
recommended
recommending this game now ai seem to go down better now and the addition of the new bootcamp training gives us all a better and more functional insight as opposed to just being told what stuff does for example your trainer will now call compass direction by nesw and by bearing 0360 mixing it up so you can get used to it and imo that is the best way to learn by making you think it rather than read it scenarios from the workshop have upped my piloting skills massively and all my other skills theyre great fun and many of them are multiplayer giving you drones to mark targets and jets to kill them also some great infantry based insurgency missions that i like a lot bad news is you need at least double the recommened settings to play multiplayer decently and if your impatient and cant be bothered to wait for a minute or not run ahead this probably wont be your thing
recommended
huge potentiality in this one how ever huge minus for the multiplayer expirience it was very laggy and desync all the time
recommended
pretty good game
recommended
do not expect to find a completed military simulator upon downloading the game do a little research get the mods from the modding community and then play this game will not have many of the most requested features its always been up to the fans to mod the game to perfection dont expect that to change here with the right mods this game can take hours out of your life without the mods this game will fall short of your expectations do not get this game if you dont like having your game modded if the mods arent out there yet give it some time arma ii fans welcome to the next installment its about to get intense
recommended
epic game with awesome graphics best arma multiplayer yet
recommended
arma 3 is a game that is at its best with friends and well made community missions the single player campaign can be difficult for impatient players or someone who is generally bad but a good player will be able to get through it the ingame editor is what gives arma games the ability to endure and allows new missions to be made or for weapon testing however some scripting knowledge even if its basic is needed for more dynamic missions but for some people 70% of their time may be here multiplayer can be tricky if you cant find any descent servers to play on or dont know a single friend that is willing to play arma often the graphics when set to lowstandard quality will not look half as good as any other mainstream fps but a computer with a descent graphics card and good cpu will have no problem unless you take the settings to the extreme the upcoming dlcs and expansion are hopefully going to add a nice amout of ingame content the modding community itself acts as a hub of occasionally quality addons current problems that do still exist in arma 3 however area the ai environmental damage physics and a lack of diversity in each factions arsenal some pluses for the game are as mentioned the communities divotion to the series the only other game ive personally seen with such a dedicated modding base recently is skyrim another one of the points towards arma 3 is the maps not only are they massive in comparision to stock military games but they also have similar amounts of detail where the developers saw fit finally despite the occasional ai issues the game really does give players a different experience everytime once my friend and i fought valiantly against overwhelming odds and lost we played again and won again we got wiped immediatly and again we saw the ai flip their ifv over which was funny all on the same mission combined arms old currently arma 3 is a 710 but depending on bohemias roadmap arma could end with a 910 new after bootcamp and with the helicopters dlc about to be released not to mention the make arma not war entries so far the game is moving along and becoming better as was intended and my score for it has risen from 710 to a 810
recommended
you couldnt even run this with the matrix
recommended
great game for friends to play together with
recommended
altis life stole a helicopter took a man hostage landed got chased by the police got captured got charged with grand theft auto evading police and rekless flying and got put in prison for 10 minutes 1010 would take hostage again
recommended
this game has an better gamplay then arma 2 and its better beautifull and big
recommended
if you like awesome army stuff then multiply by 100  arma3
recommended
feels wrong writing a review of this game now as its not finished the engine alone is just limitless to what can be created the online community is very active providing a mass of servers and different game types overall awesome game and can only get better
recommended
kind of glitchy but a load of fun and an insane amount of depth if you are a fan of games with a good amount of tacticality this is a must buy even at its pricepoint
recommended
arma 3 is an excellent wararmy simulation game great graphics excellent gameplay was really impressed what makes arma 3 different form its predecessors is the engine also it has a ton of fun and exciting mods like breaking point which is arma 3 dayz
recommended
this is the best military simulation game that there is
recommended
best army simulation in entire time then ill play gameswery nice work 
recommended
altis is love altis is life  1110
recommended
all wars should be fought on arma
recommended
i shot a 120mm round at a guys knee i never saw him again 1010 would recommend
recommended
it could use some more content and an introduction to modding without having to go through endless forum threads but its a pretty solid game probably the most fun game ive ever played once you get past the learning curve its really an amazing experience
recommended
welcome to the best military simulator of all time how i here you ask because unlike cod and bf4 you dont sponge a bullet to the face
recommended
one of the best simulator games i played
recommended
so much better than arma 2 910 for me
recommended
the newest installment in the arma series has shown itself to be capable of becoming a valid successor to itself the new features in this game can make an interesting urban firefight into a strategic and wellthought out plan in arma 2 there were very little options for infantry mobility in arma 3 consider that no problem enhanced moving capabilities make popping in and out of cover much more intuitive and conveinent than in arma 2 arma 3 is rapid growing game with a lot of different gamemodes too worth every penny
recommended
great game with endless possibilities
recommended
the best war simulator
recommended
must have for any arma fan
recommended
good game iwth weapon resting mod i got aids and lived to tel l this tale
recommended
war is hell this game is so real its scary 1210 swag
recommended
arma is how my hubby convinced me to join the pc gaming community couldnt say enough good about it cant wait to see how it evolves over the next few years 
recommended
great game when played with the right group of people single player campaigns while challenging can be a little dull after a while but this seems to be the way of life for games these days edit 16052014  the new campaigns added since i left my review have made the world of difference changes have been made to the game itself and it looks simple beautiful there are lighting effects that make your choice of where you shoot from and approach your enemy critical arma 3 is simply awesome and if youre the kind of player to expect one shot kills with an assault rifle from 100m then go and play cod because you will be sorely dissappointed if however you`re after a genuine challenge of realistic warfare then get this game convince some buddies to join you and get tactical
recommended
if you like realistic war games this has to be yours
recommended
massive massive and one more massive improvement from arma 2 ive only really played muliplayer so i cant really review the campaign but if youre mainly after playing mods such as battle royale then you will be impressed by the improvement from arma 2
recommended
this game is amazing
recommended
great gameso realistic
recommended
favorite game of all time i am a huge fan of bohemias new workofart i myself love the futuristic setting theyre going for and altis is a jewel 9510
recommended
one of my favorite games of all time you can build bases play campaign multiplayer all that good stuff i recommend
recommended
love altis life awesome for fps ppl and rp ppl your in for it too
recommended
another great game in the arma seris keep it up bohemia because im not tired of this yet 910
recommended
great military simulator and an amazing followup to arma 2 810
recommended
this is very amazing game  you guys should buy it 
recommended
why not
recommended
the game is apsolutly awesome grapichworldits bugged in 30 min gameplay oncesecond best arma game
recommended
arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter it really is more of a war simulator overall it is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve the games strong point in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer where you make missions and what not i find this single feature what makes arma stand out the best more shooters should have the level of control arma 3 gives players there were a few cons to all of its pros though so i will list my biggest as follows 1 multiplayer servers if not set up properly and efficiently can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your fps frames per second 2 i feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work making the game more accessible to new players 3 better single player arma may be best for its multiplayer but i think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable all in all i think arma 3 does the shooter war simulation best it may not be as popular as games like cod or battlefield but thats not a bad thing imagine if it was that popular then we would be dealing with those guys
recommended
amazing game mus buy if into military simulations or the arma series
recommended
probably the most indepth shooter game so far
recommended
best like real gameplay when you hear bullets pass over puts you in a place where you never think you be in
recommended
i can look around with my head
recommended
this game has many modified servers making it worth every penny and even though it has a full inventory of vehicles it is incredibly difficult to stop playing even if you change server it has details you will not find in most games of its kind on different servers and on singleplayer mode it is not a walkover and you are challenged with the full feel and suppression war brings with good graphics and huge map enviroments citys and towns to explore i feel as this game should win more awards just for the playability and incredibly varied choice of things to do in game its quite simply neverending and the maps are very very big 20km what game makes you travel that distance and your still not quite where you want to be there is always alittle more to see with all the mods that are being done in multiplayer 20 this cost me on a pre release the best money i have ever spent so much so i bought 4 friends a copy of the game  and ive never done that in 30 years of gaming
recommended
awesome game i love it looking forward to the expansions and mods being released for this
recommended
best game in history
recommended
with mod tools lean serious communities supported by dedicated servers arma 3 will satisfy veteran pc gamers used to all the amenities that so many franchises dropped because the game stays true to its roots yet innovates in such a way that expands the possibilities but does not limits them
recommended
in brief  if youre an arma enthusiast arma 3 is a _must_  if you dont know the arma series this game is a must   infantry simulator with the ability to drive vehicles land air sea with high degree of fidelity and real simulation physics gameplay story for single players graphics the game is just awesome warning if youre picky might commit suicide on the first pseudobug encountered or you like fps action johnwaynestyle this is not for you this is more a simulator than a shootemup game where tactics speed of wit and experience play an invaluable role in the missions and sometimes things dont behave as expected but rarely but it happens however if you like to zero updown your sniper scope to compensate for the distance if it makes you happy to carry a couple of weapons in your backpack your magazines in your bandolier and night vision goggles on your combat helmet if it matters for you to enter a vehicle and find most of the internals working like speedfuelrpm gauges mirrors screens if you like uavs and small drones that fit in your backpack if you like to select your ammo type tracer belt regular mag if you find it awesome to play in an environment with kilometers of viewdistance if it engages you to play a game where there is no health bar but every bullet counts both the ones you deliver or receive if you like to customize the game and create your own scenarios and campaigns and play them with your friends if you like to play zeus yup the greek god with the lightning bolt if if if all or most of the above apply to you well this game is for you this is one of the games i cant recommend enough
recommended
tldr better gameplay controls sound & graphics then arma 2 however it has way less content atm arma 3 is better suited for those who want a more casual arma experience its less of a simulator and more of a game this time and it shows with the greatly improved controls where it feels like you are playing a proper fps and not a clunky simulator the first part of the singleplayer campaign is the only good arma campaign i have experienced and i did play all of the arma 2 campaigns so they did a good job there and im looking forward to the next part of the campaign because of its improved controls its a lot more enjoyable to play it singleplayer then it was in previous games which means that you will have hundreds of hours of enjoyment just playing through all the singleplayer missions on the steam workshop because of the modding contest there will hopefully be tons of content coming up soon and im looking forward to the near future of arma 3 as to the multiplayer side of things there are already a ton of fun gamemodes and missions out there however as always the best way to play arma is with a arma community playing on private servers overall its worth buying man just get it already
recommended
great game awesome alternative to battlefield 3 if youre looking for a slower paced more tactical game experience amazing visuals tempt me to lose track and just fly around the map to just explore the main map of altis has over 200km of shoreline with over 270 square km of map space arma 2 chernarus was 225km2 with the new lighting and physics added to the engine night conflicts are no longer a pain but great to play ragdoll physics in the game are tastefully done in my opinion i recomend this game the addition of the ease of modding makes this game perfect to tailor to your perfect prefrences
recommended
very hardcore game for anybody who likes mil sims as much as i do although if you are nto used to the arma series i do not reccomend it to you there are so many controls to remeber but you can still learn them def a 1010 game
recommended
this game is great if you want an advanced tactical shooter that is virtualy infinite
recommended
i have been playing the series when it was first introduce under another name many years back as operation flashpoint all the way up to arma 3 the game is a sandbox of which you can create any battlefield with any numbers of players or ai it has many vechicles to use from tanks to chopper to fixed wing military aircraft the weapons in the game alsohave attachments that change the look and functions of the weapon it is a very cooperative experence from many team oriented aspects you can have one team member flying a jet to provide air cover to another team member operating artillery to another team member giving fire support with his 50 cal rifle to a tank giving fire support far off in the distance the game includes a editor to create your own mission and soon will have a game master mode free dlc zeus to dynamically change any mission while it is being played by many people it also has a amazing and talented modding community to has been with this game series since its very early incarnations the developer has also released all the data files from arma 2 and its standalone expansion arrowhead and dlcs to be used to important any of that content into a3 bohemia interactive has also provided the tools to use for this such as its 3d modeling software oxygen possibilities the possiblities are nearly endlesss in this any battle you can imagine can be created with the game in its locations and has far more gameplay depth than most shooter out there it may be difficult to get used to the gameplay because it relies very heavily on planning observing and teamwork as characters and pcs in the game die pretty easily graphics 1010 sound 1010 singleplayer story feel game is not worth $60 without one multiplayer 1010 reviewers tilt 55 1010 note singleplayer story is coming episodically with each major update to a3 i feel the game at $40 usd it well worth the money though at $50$60 usd only worth it if you played a lot of arma 2  operation arrowhead and want a major upgrade
recommended
this game is the best simulation fps ever made sure it still has to expand but even at this point you have unlimited hours of playing with super realistic challenges mission editor campaings different multiplayer games etc the game gives you a variety of options from squad commands to character and vehicle movements you have submarines too p the shooting is as realistic as a game can offer you nowadays if you didnt like arma 2 dont think that arma 3 is the same you must check it out in the end i think that you should buy this game if you like a bit more realistic fps and want some real challanges to face see you on the field soldier
recommended
a brilliant yet realistic military game as expected from the arma series
recommended
great game
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
great game though i do recommend to someone that is considering buying this game to have a somewhat decent pc to play it its no fun playing a shooting game when you can barely even shoot accurately due to having bad performance
recommended
this game this game is ballayoloswag420
recommended
shot ten people with an lmg without any pants or shirt on 1010
recommended
i can rub my  on the rug like my dog does 1010 would rub again

great game
recommended
absolutely fantastic game you dont even need dayz to experience the ultimate awesomeness that this game posesses
recommended
awesome game breaking point is a great mod for the game as well well worth your time and money
recommended
if you want a good feeling tactical shooter this game is for you i love this and have put in countless hours a mod friendly game and a large community make this a double wammy beauty 55
recommended
fun with friends
recommended
you think you good in fps game try arma 3
recommended
this is sick depending on the type of game you can team up in wasteland have an all out war in team death match snipers are amazing so many rifles 3 rocket launchers with a laser guidence system grenades smoke and mortors i love it
recommended
one of the most versatile game
recommended
nice graphics ai of enemies catchy storyline so far we will see in upcoming patches realistic weaponry realistic vehicles and aircraft lot of servers and mods to play its killer if you dont have appropriate hardware could be too hardcore for someone 50 euros be honest allied npcs ai
recommended
besst game ever i love bi provides the community with all the means to create custom content
recommended
arma 3 is a good game but it is still a work in progress there are many bugs and glitches that will be punched out as time goes by but that shouldnt keep you from buying the game look at arma 2 it has become a huge success mostly tahnks to dayz but its rp aspect arma 3 is a truly nextgen game which is capable of doing so much buy it dont ask any questions just do it
recommended
just some words great game but many bugs
recommended
most def one of the best shooters i have ever played
recommended
it was ok 1110 ign
recommended
my hours on record should speak for the game itself its only in beta and already is such a fun game sure the ai are a little buggy but wasteland coop hell even just playing helicopter tag is fun its a sandbox game so you can spawn in stuff in the editor and create a mission and then play it however you want to one of the greats of our generation going beyond anything call of duty battle field halo have done or probably will do i highly recommend this game
recommended
a highly tactical kind of fps what with it being a milsim and all this is a great game for those who want to take fps at a slower and more calculating pace and it definitely rewards you for being a professional player that said the player base that actually has groups to play with are very professional regardless of age i do recommend this game to those who seek a quasirealistic experience at being a soldier
recommended
well if you can play this then go for it but dis game not optimizsedsed and not run good my 2 gtx 780s can run this fine but with occasi0n4l problems game pley is gud but sumtimes lots of running and driving but overall 75100
recommended
too good well that was easy
recommended
amazing game alot of different community made gamemodes available
recommended
i love this game 1010 i love the guns and items and the user interface thats a big plus way better than arma2 why are u reading this go buy it now im going to buy thats for shore 1010 
recommended
i shot a fish in the face
recommended
this game is awesome buy it
recommended
much realism pew pew
recommended
nice  best game ever 
recommended
moar realistic than real life
recommended
great game if you like more than just your average reflex shooter this is a war simulator not an arena shooter so it has a bit more of a learning curve but once you are into it there is nothing like it
recommended
its like skyrim with a bigger map
recommended
other than the few glitches and bugs this game is about the best simulator i have ever played its your call you can play it serious such as rpg servers or even for fun such as stratisaltis life the mods available are very fun and diverse top notch
recommended
this game is so amazing thats all i have to say
recommended
where to start ok on whole bohemia games are just that little bit more special than most other games the reason is not that they have the greatest graphics or smoothest game play infact if you was judging their games on that alone then i wouldnt be writing a positive review no the great thing  and i used the word great as that is what bohemia do  about the games made by this indie company have a very realistic feel to them granted arma3 compared to previous arma releases is way out infront iin the graphics stakes but as i have already said there is so much more to the arma series than just graphics alone some of the mods made for them have gone on to be legends  or rather a legend  in its own right but even if you end up buying arma 3 and never adding a mod to it it is still worth every penny that your going to spend i think its fair to say that these days spending under forty english pounds on entertainment wont get you much arma 3 breaks that trend you will get hour after hour day after day and if your not careful month after month of realistic heart pumping excitement from this game infact calling any of the arma series a game is not doing it justice arma is not only entertainment its something a little bit special if your at college i suggest not purchasing this until you are on a break if you have a fulltime job then maybe now is the time to use those days off you are owed and if you have a partner then tell them you think you should have a break for a while yes it really is that good
recommended
poor optimization but overall very good game
recommended

the campaign firstly i must address the campaign in this game i have finally bit the bullet and played it i did not enjoy it for a single second the ai seems to be 10x smarter within the campaign you would think this is a good thing because it would pose more of a challenge but no this is not the case the ai seems to have xray aimbot and sixth sense all in one at times i am completely hidden and they will spot me instantly not missing a single bullet and kill me within seconds the first mission of adapt is by far the worst thing bohemia has ever created you are one man vs over 40 foot soldiers and 1 annoying chopper you can pick up ammo from dead bodies that are generously placed about the map but that wont do you any good once you are getting shot from every single spot you could possibly imagine i cannot fathom bohemia interactives thought process behind this thing they have the audacity to call a campaign i advise anyone to steer clear of it if you ever decide to give it a go its not worth the 5 hours you will put into it i regret every second  the editor by far the best thing about arma 3 being able to put your own spin on the game creating the missions you want to play just a little note any user made campaign is better than bohemia interactives campaign the editor is what has led to me putting over 200 hours into this game its so fun to create a scenario to play your way if you have a desire to create your own missions and even campaigns arma 3 is the game for you it does have a bit of a learning curve if you want to add tasks complex waypoints your own music etc  the multiplayer i have also put a huge chunk of time playing the multiplayer whether its the annex mission or wasteland the muliplayer of arma 3 offers so much to do the multiplayer is one of arma 3s best features you can play online with i would say over 50 people at times on the vast 100km altis and stratis depending on the missiongame mode you play you can easily waste away 20 hours a week on the multiplayer  graphics this game has beautiful graphics an enormous improvement over its predecessor arma 3 has luscious environments whether its at the depths of the ocean floor or running up to the nearest hill arma 3 has amazing graphics that you will notice straight away the maps are so detailed and colorful with plentiful vegetation that makes the huge map of stratis and altis feel alive realism this game is the best military shooter to date if you are an avid fan of call of dutybattlefield this game is no where near comparable its aimed to be the most realistic military sim in the market   overall i recommend this game to anyone who enjoys military simulators and doesnt mind a shooter being slow paced this game requires a lot of patience my final verdict is 810 this game is way better than its predecessors but still lacks a lot of things
recommended
its great just if you dont like those complex controls then i wouldnt recommend it but if you can get used to it easily youre set overall great game
recommended
meh its not bad
recommended
greatest game ever most hours played on any game got to know some awesome people because of this game
recommended
i recomend arma3 because arma2 arma and the original operation flashpoint were literaly game changing games based on you know what if you dont know what this game is about you dont wantneed it arma 3 is an alpha game the first i have ever been a part of and def the first time i have heard of paying to play an alpha version of any game but its pretty good and only going to get better best part about all the arma series is the modding comunity so many free mods your head will spin if you want to see a few before dl try going to armahollicscom

recommended
arma 3 is a great open game with a lot of posibilities and things to do game modes such as altis life or wasteland are fun yet challenging but can also be quite frustrating the servers always have a great staff to help out in case you need to report someone or just need help with the server
recommended

call of duty battlefield what are those arma is a simulator game compared to those pesky arcade games nobody can 360 you here nobody can quickscope you either this is the real mlg try to go on a rush and see yourself getting shot its all about tactics how good your teamwork is and how efficient you play pros unimaginably good ui game gets every command as i want to transfer no problem good netcode even with 200ms you hardly feel the lag most match lookups have no problem at all stunning graphics yes it can use a better thing or two but it is a simulator game and gives you the simulating graphics too not to mention a large variety of adjustables for graphics total realism okay well maybe except the magical first aid kits rest is pretty much correct brilliant single player campaign unique for me multiplayer with mod support let it be epoch or altis life zeus or whatever you can think of theres a mod related to military i can count these up to infinite but just get the game and see for yourself cons bad low graphic performance or i have a really ancient gpu geforce 610m gets 30fps with everything at lowest 100% scaling with 768p drops down to 1718 on really hammering areas games way too cpu intensive i can go for a cpu stress test with this game maybe i should type this as a pro 2 in 1 program p way too costly 124try for vanilla version and 159try for extended even with 50% discount it felt like it was a full priced game to me if youre not fan of arma series or really want to get this game i cant recommend it without a discount a bit complex commands takes a few hours to get used to it hell it can even be days also not everyone can play this game takes a bit of extra buttons or few macros for quick responding to situations go and do your thing private

this is one of the greatest game out i play a3l all the time is alot of funlirikforlife

hard to set up and get used to at first but once you get to know it you will love it 
recommended
awesome game if you played bohemias other games in the series arma 2 and arma 2 oa then you have to get this the graphics are beautiful although you need a good computer obviously to run it well the combat still feels a little stiff but its a huge improvement from the last games they added an actual working physics engine and the features inventory system gun attachments etc are top notch the use of tactic and strategy is required so if you like that kind of stuff then youll like this its still a pretty early release so im sure they will be releasing more vehicles and guns soon also it comes equipped with the steam workshop which is amazing considering steams community is great at making modifications that make the game ten times better just get the damn game already

rammed into a jet at the arfield with a hunter going 100 kmh flew 18 km from the airfield in a blown up hunter rated game 1010 httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid398382783
recommended
this is the best military sim
recommended
a really fun game that is a great improvement compared to arma 2 when it comes to combat and animations as well as the variety of gamemodes however the game is a little unfinished or requires a little more refurbishment when it comes to general points such as audio and factions combat audio such as firefight sounds including distancing of gunshot sounds is disapointing however overall the game is a deffinate must buy and some improvements can be made with few simple mods easy to download
recommended
really good game i give it a 1010 after the heli dlc i havent been able to play it though it keeps crashing  010
recommended
arma 3 is a really good game if you feel like a real army game go and play arma good tactics etc makes your team win for the roleplayers out here they are also at the right addres arma has an rp mod called altis life this is fantastic for people who love rp with good graphics i really recommend this game for actually every player who loves an army game and for people who seek real roleplay
recommended
amazing game good for pc gamers  fun and liitle bugs here and then but overall good game

best game of 2014 award goes to this withought question

while buggy at times i throughly enjoy this game it is an easy transition from arma ii and is a good buy for anyone who enjoyed arma ii 455
recommended
the most polished smooth arma experience yet and its still in alpha the upgrade to beta then full release looks like it will only be more content as i have yet to find any bugs if your an arma fan this is a must buy
recommended
running around aimlessly through miles of durkadurka land squinting your eyes for multiple hours trying to find something that moves once you do you find out that you need to reload your gun and you get shot a million and a half times i like this game it is fun
recommended
i recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter this game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game controls are most fluid then arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical it does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like rl i didnt log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the sc sector control game mode and its fantastic you gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update
recommended
altis life is dead dont even buy this game
recommended
this game is definately not your standard cod run and gun type of game you are forced to use tactics and the enviroment around you to gain the advantage and with all the multiplayer content as well as custom missionsmods you will never get bored
recommended
this game is great especially with friends breaking point also adds so much to this already amazing game d
recommended
absolutely amazing now you will ned a beefy computer to play with graphics that are decent and a framerate that is above 30 fps but even on a laptop running it at 20 fps with the lowest graphics possible its still hella fun to play one of the best military simulators out on the market
recommended
is very fun
recommended
its a lot of fun how ever it needs a favorite server tab so you can find servers you like to play on easy but thats it
recommended
brilliant graphics and amazing military experience  mein furher steiner
recommended
an alright game i recommend arma ii combined operations over this
recommended
1010 would play again
recommended
when writing a review on most games i dont really know what to say this applies to arma so i decided id just share my thoughts on the game arma 3 is amazing it has so much to do although its similar to arma 2 i still feel it deserves its own game highly recommend this game to anyone all the hate towards arma is other you dont like this type of game or feel like arma 3 is in vanilla i can agree with the vanilla part but i still enjoy the game if i was to say any downside at all i would say that the dlc should be bigger and not 2 helis that should already be in the game legendary game 1010
recommended
yes aint got nothing more to say
recommended
definitely worth the $60 been playing it ever sense i bought it 1010 would buy again
recommended
great game good graphics
recommended
arma 3 is the deciscive military sim for the hardcore military gamer with excellecnt graphics and fun gameplay for hardcore fans the 3rd iteration of arma is a huge step in the right direction however the game suffers from poor optimization and bad ai however with a decent enough pc any gamer can play the ai however cannot be fixed by a simple computer they sit and dont attack zig and zag instead of dive for cover overall however i would give it a solid 7510
recommended
to be honest arma 3 alone is good but the community mods for it are really what makes the game come alive in the mil sim community once you go arma you will never go back
recommended
hello very good game if into simulation and also it relates very well to real life this game is very mod flexible and there have been alot of mod releases latley eg arma 3life milsin units and all of that sort of stuff that takes the modding cabablilties very far with this game
recommended
best military simulator ever
recommended
this game is amazing by far and as u would hope the most realistic and beautifully designed military sim game i have ever played there are hundreds of amazing mods still early in developement though of course as well as the different game modes u can play in multiplayer such as wasteland is tons of fun when u buy this game u are really buying like 1000 different games in 1
recommended
lol great game just get it already dingus
recommended
this game has outstanding potential hidden inside it over arma 2 and arrowhead both graphics features and gameplay has improved significantly unfortunately cannot say the same thing about performance not only you need a beast of a pc to run it at a decent framerate on singleplayer on multiplayer that thousands of dollars worth pc wont help you since its completely down to the server hardware every ai unit you add to the battle might and will impact your framerate if there are 30 units kiss 10 frames goodbye if there are 100 units that will sum up to at least 20 frames engine itself is heavily dependent on cpu and by that i mean its clock speeds at this moment ai runs on the main gameserver thread to combat any desynch in multiplayer in turn tickrate hits the dirt considering game is not multicore optimized at all neither hyperthreading nor octacores will help you if you do not have a nvidia card and you are planning to run the game with a cpu thats a little better than whats recommended dont bother it will slice 10 from your frames culprit physx even with the top of the line cpu and gpus in sli do not dream about anything over 60 frames on a populated coop single player or multiplayer mission you will get dips below 40 at times graphic settings wont impact your frames much as long as you reduce cpu hogging settings such as clouds and drawdistance you can run the game at ultra without much of an issue framerate impact is completely because of cpu under utilization mechanics are amazing gunplay is exceptional ai can be extremely clever and they communicate flank use supports and can make your life a misery if you arent situationally aware single player is extremely interesting and mission editor gives unlimited content possibilities on development branch introduction of zeus dlc wasnt in vain its such a great addition consider it as a more user friendly mission editor that comes with the game plus you can adjust everything in real time it will make you forget about the performance for $3599 its a good package but if you arent really into such a game i say wait for a better discount
recommended
after waiting for so long arma3 has arrived although its an alpha verion the game seems so promising
recommended
now this game is a complicated one to review on its own its nothing really and definately not worth 3500 but with all of the mods made by the community arma 3 has definately saved the mods that i would personally recommend you get for this game are arma 3 breaking point arma 3 battle royal and arma 3 life mod
recommended
i would recommend this game at full price totaly worth it i barly know anything about the millitary or fps and i picked it up really quicky fun to screw around on multiplayer and other gamemodes
recommended
an excellent military simulator has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at like most multiplayer games arma 3 works alot better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination which is a very important factor in arma 3 its fairly system intensive  but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing i would highly reccomend it especially if you have friends to play it with
recommended
hours of fun and a good time worth full price
recommended
awesome game to play

have you ever been kidnapped before well ill tell you one thing its terrifying me and my 2 armed other friends just fueled up our car and we started leaving the gas station as we were leaving 2 men in a suv parked theyre car right infront of ours and told us to get out we were scared so we attempted to drive away all of a sudden rubber bullets started flying everywhere they managed to knock out my friends i was still conscious but i was terrified they tied us up with zip ties put us in a suv and took away our phones as we were being kidnapped i noticed a man hiding behind a building we were brought to a junk yard with a tall crane they brought us all the way to the top at this point i knew it was the end they were gonna gonna kill us all of a sudden i noticed a man at the bottom of the crane then i saw 3 cop cars driving towards the junk yard the 2 armed men started shooting at the cops as they were shooting i saw a helicopter flying towards us i was happy and scared at the same time bullets started flying everywhere almost hitting every part of my body one of the kidnappers started climbing down the ladder towards the bottom some how i managed to break free of my zip ties and i pulled out a gun and shot the armed man shooting at the cops me and my friends started screaming saying we were the victims one cop climbed up the ladder and told us to get to the bottom immediately so we did and as soon as we got to the bottom we asked questions about the situation we got pardoned of our crimes for killing one of the kidnappers all of a sudden i heard gun shots flying everywhere i noticed they were rubber bullets because i saw many cops getting knocked out i looked up and saw the helicopter flying away probably requesting for back up i looked back down and noticed everyone knocked out and tied up the only ones who were still free was me and my friend my friend started shooting at the armed man i tried to peek and see if could get a clear shot but as i peeked gun shots flew near my head so i looked for cover i saw my friend on the ground unconscious i saw the armed man walking towards my friend tieing him up i had the perfect shot i aimed my gun slowly towards head and took the shot i quickly ran towards the police and unrestrained them they quickly unrestrained my friends we ended up driving to kavala in shock of what just had happened we kept driving and never looked back that doesnt just happen in any other multiplayer game i thought it was all just a movie a show or something i never knew that could ever happen in a videogame if youre looking to buy it you must do it now if you ever want an expereience like that then this is the game you should buy 1110 ign

the greatest military sandbox i have ever played arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic its a challenge to learn but well worth it the main campaign can be frustrating at times but overall is a very excellent experience usermade content and scenerios add another layer of depth and zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game giving an indepth experience in many a situation you can play it as a roleplayer joining life servers you can be a survivor of the wastes in wasteland or you can join in many usermade situations the greatest of the options however is proper teambased objective gameplay with the right men squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds it gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling if you want a verywell made military simulator offering wonderful graphics processormelting situations teamwork tension and combinedwarfare operation arma 3 is for you
recommended
first thing about this title is that it may be called a game but it is a simulator there is a big difference if you buy this looking for cod or battlefield type game play you are going to be extremely disappointed you cannot sprint around forever your equipment weighs you down and gets you tired you can die of heat exhaustion running a kilometer and going prone doesnt allow you to shoot the wings off of a fly you are going to have to wait till you heart stops pounding and your hands stop shaking guns use ammo ammo which you dont get from running over the corpse of someone you killed it needs to be the right caliber and in a mag that fits the weapon you are using and thats just the beginning the gameplay has evolved a bit since arma 2 you can dive in the water now and there are a lot of different stances to help with firing from or getting behind cover the inventory system has evolved greatly but still not very user friendly to those not familiar with the arma series the story so far is not the reason to buy the game actually the story is pretty weak where arma 3 shines is the user created content user missions user mods arma is one of if not the most moddable game ive ever seen from full conversion fallout  stalker type game mods to dynamic user missions that pits you against insurgent activity and linked side missions that pop up all over the map ie stop an enemy convoy from getting from a to b so that bs defenses are weaker take out the radio tower so they cannot call for backup kill the commanding officer to put the others in a state of chaos all in all an ok game on its own but an awesome game because of the modding community the one thing that i hold against it is that bohemia has yet to release a working 3d editor for it the community has made some awesome mods to make up for this but that does not let bohemia off the hook for not having a working one out already especially since modding and editing is the only saving grace for this game
recommended
great game fun to play this game gives so much online game modes to play you will never be bored d

unless youve been living under a rock im sure you have heard of dayz and how it is now a standalone game or a mod for arma 2 oa arma 3 takes most the good points from arma 2 and vastly improves on them whilst removing or improving some of the lacking features in arma 2 such as driving swimming and physics to mention a few as will all arma games they are best played with a close group of friends to form a team this will greatly improve the amount of fun you can get out of arma 3 various game mode like king of the hill wasteland altis life breaking point and the new takistan life will give you plenty of options to play not to mention the huge list of custom games on the steam workshop arma 3 is the best triple a title i have ever bought worth every bit 9510

arma 3 is a good game 1010 in honest review i had been playing some wasteland with some friends and we started to build a base we finally got the base running and stocked with almost everything this was when the situation started to get bad we were all sat in a tower just casually looking out into the wilderness when suddenly the opfor came for us this was when the attack started they came at us with everything the attack started by a tank firing directly at our tower at first we didnt think it was firing at use we just thought it was trying to destroy something else this was when suddenly a tank shell came flying into the tower it blew up magnificantly bodies flying everywhere after this we all spawned on the spawn becon we came parachuting into the base helicopters flying all over the gaf me and one of my friends decided to stay in a building to get away from the shelling of the tanks and helicopters but then suddenly all their vehicles and men moved in on our base they destroyed the building we were in so we tried to flee as you could tell that went horrible but we luckely took out a couple of them we then died and respawned back on the spawn becon i came flying into the base trying to land on the hills surrounding i tried flanking the aa tank that was there it ended badly after about 20 minutes of waiting we headed back to the base to see what was left there was basically nothing left after seeing the wreckage we decided to head out to a vehicle store whilst we were heading towards it we ran into a convoy which surprisingly was the people who just destroyed our base we ran into the bushes and hid behind both rocks and bushes after i had the briliant idea to start throwing smokes to throw them off our scent then finally saw where i was and made a crater where i was lying after this experience i have to give the game 1010 best experience i have ever had in a video game do get this game if you have the money and you can have an epic experience

this just sums up every arma game youve just joined in the ranks of the elite the ranks of the el what hey look at me brave and tough were special forces and we want you on our team special forces me heres your weapon and your stuff youll fight battles and be all you can be a cog in the machine is it brutal as can be youll end up with acute ptsd prepare to get immersed and do just what we say and if you do it right you will forget this is a game now shoulders down and chin up high and you cant jump so try to vault its all so realistic wait no jumping hey thats not our fault lets have some fun now load your gun and take aim at that man dont shoot til we say you can if we can learn to do it you can learn to do it once you know the basics theres nothing to it follow in our footsteps boot by boot you can learn to do it too now call of duty what a joke and we got sick of battlefield i never cared for battlefield this guys a genius hey hows it feel now plot a course so whats the plan i say we run and gun no because thats too much fun if we can learn to do it you can learn to do it take that arcade nonsense and simply screw it it may all seem tedious and its true but you can learn to love it  too next you need to memorize the keyboard commands the right mouse button makes you aim and left to shoot and q to lean and shift it makes you walk or run and left control to raise your gun and pressing c will make you couch and pressing o brings up your watch the g key makes you check your pack and pressing enter views your back if you can learn to do it i can learn to do it but i cant wait to take my gun and actually shoot it but its realistic in a way and thats the thing about this game if we can learn to do it you can learn to do it pretty soon youll find that there is nothing to it fall in line behind us boot by boot and if you pull through it theres nothing to it then arma is the game for you and here is the video that made this song possible wwwyoutubecomwatchvig9z_hdsjuu

very fun tactical realistic game multiplayer is nice varitey of gamemodes singleplayer is always fun and has a nice storyline id reccomend this to anybody who is thinking about getting arma 3 really looking forward to future updates and enhancements nice one again bohemia

this game is many different ways to play it this game isnt like cod or battlefield where the are only very few different ways to play it cod or battlefield that it just eventually gets old arma 3 has a great campaign and it allows you to take matters into your own hands arma 3 also has a great multiplayer category to pick from arma 3 has a great survival gamemode thats just like dayz but without zombies arma 3 also has gamemodes like capture the flag and deathmatch and a few others but one of the best multiplayer game modes is coop which is really good to play with friends the greatest thing about arma 3 is that it really allows you to get the feel of what real combat is like and the realism of the game is unbelievably great if your looking for a game that is really realistic then arma 3 is probabaly the game you could be looking for

best military sim there is or rp there is just a massive game the positives far outweigh the negatives on this one gotta say battle royale by player unknown is my favorite game mode in arma iii start with nothing so you have to scavenge up some weapons and accessories so you can be the last man standing love it 1010

this game has its ups and downs it has greatly improved since its official release as it was extremely dissapointing lack of altis servers altis servers had no guns or vehicles or rarely any no mods campaign was not available at start i did not care but to many they cared and many optimization and bug issues all issues have been pretty much addressed and fixed but there are issues that can still be fixed as they include an issues tracker in which you can report issues and recieve feedback from developers and users forgetting the few issues it has it is still a great tactical military simulator that you can enjoy with yourself your clan or your friends this game definetly became an alltime favourite for me as the graphics look beautiful even if you play on low and gameplay is quite realistic to any other game

arma 3 is definatly easily my favorite game of all time it produced an unforgetable experience it showed stunning visual gamplay along with a brilliant engine that works very well with the game it has a massive selection of weapons and vehicles the community of arma 3 is amazingly massive there are tons of gamemodes and servers just waiting to be played on it comes with a campaign that is entertaining and well developed it also has a gigantic workshop community with new weapon skins vehicles and all sorts being added each day this game is simply fantastic and well worth every penny 1010

arma 3 a tacticool shooter sorry that was terrible arma 3 is an apparent military simulator id personally call it a casual simulator considering the bugs the engine is riddled with them but the devs are active on fixing bugs and creating new ones in the process there are issues such as  the movement system transitions can be jarring a sprint can becoming a walk just because the terrain is slightly steeper which has got me killed more than a few times in the past though it can be solved by running in weird ways up hills  over zealous stamina system 60lb of equipment will drain your stamina whilst jogging in a few minutes 10lb will do so in a few seconds later and issues like that the guys i play with tend to disable it and for good reason  futuristic theme through the use of various real world vehicles and weapons  no aks m416s and countless other classic weapons we all know and love sucks in my opinion  really dumb ai some improvements over the arma 2 ai  ai reacts faster and better but can react a little overzealous a single soldier in a good position can lock up squads by taking random shots preventing them from being ordered around units love to crawl when under fire requiring a lot of micromanaging as a squad leader  if youre playing as zeus or using high command for squads good luck there are many others but i cant think of them at the moment but now for some good news you can install mods fixing a large number of gameplay related issues sadly the first issue with the movement system cant be fixed or hasnt at least but the stamina system has been fixed by a number of mods to be somewhat more realistic and more managable mods such as rhs escalation the us forces and russian armed forces parts plus the hlc packs solve the lack of modern weapons  the two mods  packs are my faviourites for this sort of thing various realism mods around such as agm and cse also help improve the realism of the game dlc is also free with the game sort of similar to what they did in arma 2 you get the content but with some restrictions  so you can play with people who have it though you may not be able do access all the features and there may be some annoying notifications p

the best $60 ive spent this game offers so much content for the money its ridiculous not only is the campaign challenging and pretty interesting but the multiplayer game modes that come stock with arma are a blast but on top of this it has incredible mod support where players have literally created their own new maps brought maps like chernarus from the original day z mod added weapons that werent in the game via bohemias addition vehicles enemies etc it is incredible whatever you want to do as long as its in the realm of guns or cars theres a fking mod out there for it and that alone makes it worth full price any time this game makes all aaa titles charging $60  more for dlc look like  if you think you can hang and stay aware of your surroundings buy a3 its fantastic

i recommend this game to anyone who craves for a slowerpaced tactical simulator about 80% of the time you will spend travelling to the location you need to liberate or scouting the area for hostiles even then you are not guaranteed killing anyone you may get one or two kills if you are lucky that being said i love this game i prefer it to call of duty or battlefield because of the realism the ballistics in this game is possibly the most realistic compared to most shooters nowadays many of the people who play the game are either in the military or military enthusiasts that being said prepare for the annoying support our troops people however if you can get past them you will appreciate the game for what it is a lot of the combat is mid to long range unlike most modern fpss you will often witness your teammates shooting at nothing only to zoom in with binoculars and realize theyre shooting at hostiles a kilometer away the game requires you to be on your toes most of the time and to be prepared for nothing in the 5 hours i played this game at the time of writing this i experienced about 4 or 5 unique events that you could only experience in a multiplayer game i was in a helicopter that had the engine shot from an enemy machine gunner we crash landed in the middle of nowhere only to be ambushed by enemy troops myself the pilot and two other guys were able to take out all the enemies and request evacuation from another helicopter pilot one of our guys was hit and was on the ground bleeding so a medic arrived at the scene and patched him up as well that may not sound exciting to a gamer thats used to the arcadestyle shooters but the accurate physics and realism in this game is what makes it exciting the very fact that this event occurred is rare it only happens once in a lifetime maybe if youre lucky anyways enough chatter buy this game if you enjoy tactical shooters that have an emphasis on teamwork ie working as a squad as a battallion and as an army

first time playing arma was unexpected to say the least classic king of the hill match im apart of a time of six guys in a ghost hawk with some stanger that came along we enter the ao in the heli we begin talking fire from both sides one shot takes out the back rotter all you hear is jump now only 3 of my group jump out and the rest blow up in the air i land in a tree and my two other group members are no wear to be found we meet up only to be blown up by a nade 1210 nades

this is my favorite game the fun is endless and it never gets old due to the mods and the game only gets better as time goes on i would recommend this game to anyone who has a some what good pc to run it

if youre into simulator games arma 3 is for you if youre into fps games arma 3 is for you if youre trying to live a life as a virtual military dude arma 3 is for you who doesnt love a military caombat simulator 3

arma 3 is a really niche experience it is refreshing to play an arma game when the market is so saturated with mw type military shooters to truly appreciate the realism and immersion of arma 3 you have to find a good server to play on i have not played a game in recent memory that provides the realism that this one does and the community is really the driving force behind that the gameplay is solid but the learning curve is somewhat larger than your average shooter combat is not in your face but tends to be long range engagements that last a significant amount of time the single player options are decent and provide a good means for learning the game but you should not buy this game if you are looking for a single player experience my only other significant complaint is how poorly optimized this game is it is a pretty game very pretty actually but it runs so poorly on even decent rigs that it can become quite frustrating 7510

thought about buying this for a long time arma 2 was great but i wasnt sure if this was any good if you havent played arma 3 buy it now you wont believe what kind of situations occur there

seems really cool

decent game although a bit graphics intensive uberrealistic have fun finding enemies

arma 3 is a shooter that breaks the arcade fps paradigm the versatility of this game engine and features presented therin are absolutely unmatched worthy of the title military simulator completely fly aircraft drive vehicles logistics with team strategy tact and disciplin this is the closest to a real combat environment you can get without selling your self to the man other big title shooters out there have gone the way of the run and gun shoot em up arcade styles and require very little forethought if you desire an experience that will rock your fiber and boost your blood pressure all the while training your brain arma 3 is the game for you much recommended for sensible mature players
recommended
great game i like the king of the hill mode they seem to be improving it really well just a lot of buttons and the steam workshop is a nice touch only downside is this games horriable engine the engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side once you start to add about 20 ai or players the engine starts to use the cpu or video card less and less cuasing a performance drop i seen maybe 30% cpugpu usage on a 106 player king of the hill match with 30  35fps hile on armory i can pull well into the 80s with a few players thats my only gripe about this game if they would fix that then i would have no complaints at all
recommended
best shooter ever
recommended
doesnt get more realistic for a military sim than this
recommended
its the greatest game i ever seen in my whole life
recommended
lots of fun definitely better than arma ii plays more like an fps since it doesnt feel as clunky as arma ii was you can attach and remove scopes and ammunition without using ammoboxes it is better trust me ing awesome
recommended
i have over 1500 hours on this gamethats all i have to say
recommended
after playing this game for so many hours i never cease to entertain myself whether its fighting hostile forces for control in king of the hill executing your enemies in wasteland or fighting for survival in arma 3s very own version of dayz this game is great recently dayz was ported from arma 2 into arma 3 and must i say its exquisite its a perfect port and overpoch is a ton of fun i was hooked on altis life for a very long time the roleplay in that gametype is amazing if your unsure of what altis life is check it out on youtube there are plenty of vids showcasing it  wasteland is where team tactics can really come out you choose to join one of three teams which include the  blufor nato opfor csat or the independent aaf in conclusion this game is great even if you dont have any friends to play it with youll make friends incredibly easy since overpoch has been ported its added even more to the awesome buy this enjoy it jadex out
recommended
graphics are outstanding as realistic as it gets best military simulator of all time
recommended
great gome to play with mates online and you have a thrilling singlr player too
recommended
pros most realistic fps out there as far as i know if you want to get really into a battle like a soldier thats the place cons oh boy the ai vehicle driving model could be much much better manouver of large formation looks so dumb you can technically have dozens of units in your force which is awesome though they wont recognize good paths to move and will go just straight into anything in their way including freindly infantry units which will cause them injures as a programmer myself i cant figure what was the big deal detecting units in front of a vehicle and make them stop or go to other direction if this condition is true vehicles keep colliding each other thats a serious issue which again i believe could be solved really easily also for some reason they cant drive back normally which is another major problem you get into an ambush and your driver cant find how to go backward another thing is the speed of the armoured vehicles they just go unrealistically too fast looks like this game was released with a lot of issues i would still recommend it though because in general it is fun to play
recommended
sooo good much play much enjoyment

arma 3 was listed as on sale until january 2nd at 35% off dec 31st its at 50% off im still recommending the game as its a lot of fun and looks great but lowering a sale price two days early is aggravating to those of us who waited for the holiday sale to pick it up i would have used that extra money to support an independent developer or something recently greenlit

dear bohemia you guys made a nice game yes the cons are easily noticable starting witrh the beta ready engine we all know this but still love it the fact that youre money farming people for helos dlcs and seeing if it works the fact you pander more for the life community side this time than the core fans but hey you take what you can get its still a good game if you can find a good unit to play with and mods games legit worth is about $3999 usd without the modding community i recommend this if you are someone who has a vast majority of free time playing army barbie or just a kissless virgin who never touched a woman and spends it playing out a simulation of a real life if youre a core fan dont bother 90% of core servers are hosted on 4gb of ram
recommended
arma 3 is the most realistic military sim ive seen you can find no other game that goes in such detail with weapons than arma 3 though there is a huge lack of weapons and the maps are dull empty and boring it is a good allaround game what you cant find in the game you can find in mods although it can be inconvient since the since the arma 3 steam workshop only can allow 1 pbo and only 200 mbs of space anyway its a great simulator that needs few improvements and steam compatibility but a great game
recommended
arma 3 what is there to do there is many things you can do on arma 3 here is just a quick list of things you can do and get 1 there are roleplaying servers 2 wasteland servers where everyone fights to the death 3 there is a ton of mods you can get for this game 4 a lot of friendly people 5 can make your own server for free 6 not a lot of hackers because this game has top scripters who prevent them so there was a quick list of things you can do and get do i recommend this game yes i do because this game is top knotch it has incredible views two big maps fun game modes you can play and tons of mods here is how you can create a server for free httpyoutubee3ubmigdpvs thank you for viewing this review

this game is a really fun game to play with friends i really enjoy king of the hill and wasteland this game can get boring if you have no friends to play with or cant get into a group that works together overall best helicopter sim out there o wait best go kart sim  hmm ok its a great game xd
recommended
no other game offers such a high quality go anywhere do anything experience like arma3 in arma3 you can fly and drive any vehicle you can think of  or scuba dive sky dive or just take a long walk and admire the scenery  whatever floats your boat or more likely sinks it graphics are some of the best in the industry and the size of the sandbox makes almost all other games look silly you can choose to play it in an ultra realistic mode or just for enjoyment in casual mode and even if military gamessims are not your thing you can play one of arma3s rpgs online  like altis life or wasteland etc there are literally 1000s of community made addons  mods and missions for you to play in either in sp  mp or coop mode  check out armaholic and the steam workshop and the powerful easy to use mission editor is the benchmark in the industry no other game offers such amazing value for money

this game is amazing so far its the best game all around i have played it has amazing graphics lots of differant simulations and endless replay value the main campaign is not part of the game at launch but is a free dlc in 3 differant installments the fact you can play this game in first or third person increases the amount of people this game can apeal to the learning curve is a little rough but after a few times running around doing missions or just playing around its super easy to pick up again graphics a if you dont have this game yet its worth the money i got the game during alpha i got one for my wife in beta and now the full games out and it just blows alpha and beta away with how amazing the game turned out to be

can your pc handle the awesomeness of arma 3 if so put this awesome game in your library get a steam key for 30 bucks on green man gamingcom
recommended
attention i am not reviewing arma 3 solo play i am reviewing the online multiplayer in altis life and asylum first of all let me just say that a majority of the people ive come across in this game are complete s theyll kill you take your stuff harrass you etc all while you have your back turned however the rest of the gameplay makes up for it this is one of those games where you need friends dont have friends make some it is so unbelieveably easy to make friends in this game and at that point you can actually have a promising team to get  done you will not succeed on your own sorry if youre a solo player youre gunna need a team at some point altis life is a game mode its fun and theres no limit to what you can actually do be a cop  check be a rebel  check be a taxi driver  check be a paramedic  check i love this game for the time ive played and i recommend it to anyone whos willing to die over and over to eventually succeed
recommended
this game really is quite fun despite the countless times that i have killed myself and all of my friends in horrific helicopter crashes we still manage to have a good time in this game the controls certainly take some getting used to if you are new to the series another thing worth saying is there is a gamemode for everyones own personal taste be it life wasteland cti or secotr control this game is best played with some friends or at least voice chat as it really does contribute to the experience to be able to communicate fluently with the people youre playing with the only complaint that i have is the fact that in order to fly the dualrotor cargo copters you need to fork over precious shekels that said this is still a very entertaining game and i look forward to many more hours of enjoyment from it
recommended
with the full release of arma 3 the modding community kicked into full swing releasing stellar mods like alive and jsrs2 the game can be challenging and even frustrating at times if youre not patient but rewards planning and careful engagement with an immersive and fantastic experience the editor gives player the ability to create their own scenarios from simple search and clear ops to convoy ambushes and combined arms operations and makes this game infinitely replayable i would definitely recommend this game
recommended
i love this game this game is my favorite game d
recommended
this is the perfect game if you cant afford arma 3 it is very similar to arma 3 except less quality
recommended
amazzzing game ing mate love this ing  game great grafik and much more  love it
recommended
arma 3 definitely one of the best games ive ever played next to the game assassins creed iii is arma 3 truly one of the best games ive ever played and it is definitely worth the money it has a lot of features and a huge amount of possibilitys ive played it for almost 700 hours now and i only played in the editor for now i didnt even started the campaign yet first i thought that there whould be a huge difference between arma 2 and arma 3 but besides the grahpics which are amazing and the campaign the game is almost the same as its previous version however the makers of arma 3 did a great job by improving all the gameplay experiences and possibilitys some changes between arma 2 and arma 3  customise your weapons  customise your player like changing clothes and more  submarine and swimming underwaterdiving suits  amazing improved graphics but there are also some dissapointing things in arma 3 i really missed some airplanes and ships however im using some modifications right now like the uss nimitz and the fa18 super hornet those modifications really make the game more than perfect a game like arma 3 for just 4499 is just amazing and will never be a waste of money and time it really one of the best games ever made and you wont have much problems while playing 1010 amazing game
recommended
played made owned servers of all kinds awesome game a mic is a must have for life servers
recommended
ive spent so much timeyes 200 hours are actually a lot for me with this game and it is still fun why is it still fun the community especially the right community is the reason for it playing koth cti and coop if you need an air strike then call one nothing is more epic then an a10 flyby while shootings its guns and rockets at some pesky tanks and with all these mods out there you can actually always find something new there is also a mod called alive which creates missions for you you decide which scale you decide which side and you decide everything i can only recommend this game to every military simulator lover even though it isnt as serious as dcs as example but there is already ace3 in development see you on the battlefield
recommended
you will never know a real game till you play this and learn to play it  810 on game play 910 on gfx love the goame check it out
recommended
militey sim probebly the best one out there i love this game and when the whole game comes out with differnt servers and gamemodes it will be amazing if you dont have the game do ur self a favour and but it right now
recommended
arma 3 is a great open world simulation military shooter its not like your normal run and gun shooter the game focus more on the realistic side where tactics and team work is key on being successful arma 3 give you a large variety and options kind of like battlefield 4 youre able to be just a random grunt or you can fly a helicopter not as easy as other games or drive a tank bohemia interactive did a great job on the graphics of the game as well it can be hard to find camouflaged players that are not moving unless you have thermal optics or what not i recommend this game to more of the hardcore gamers who looks for a realistic game i dont recommend it if your just trying to find a shooter to pop in and out like counterstrike
recommended
i had about 2k hours of pure awesomeness so far dlc policy if you buy it you get the little extras like gear or vehicles dont like or need those never mind then you can still play with others who use them and still take a seat as a passenger in regards to content the masses of mods will provide for all your needs anyway all players also get new developments on top the helicopterdlc for example also comes with new physics and whole new difficulty level and even really nicely working sling ropes without buying the marksmen dlc that adds some scopes and guns you also now have weapon resting usable bipods improved weapon sway and exhaustion and more to come  continued developement for free even replacing mods the audio improvements are convincing but of course you can prefer mods and still use those and there so many more mods which will add countless more vehicles and weapons maps visual effects uniforms medic and player interaction systems whole new scenarios of battle robots or dinosaurs arma has so much to offer for everyone casuals to special forces it is worth every cent it does take some effort to look things up though the basic game is big enough already to overwhelm newcomers the bootcamp mission takes care of that though and explains easy to understand everything youll be confronted with when it comes to mods youll probably already be part of a group by then to show you how those work
recommended
stop reading reviews and buy the ing game already
recommended
so much fun multiplayer is even better

fantastic improvement on arma 2 while it is a military sim and im still not 100% how to play the proper game modes theres plenty for the adverage fps player to make the most of gun game and battle royale to name a few
recommended
king of the hill is life invade & annex is life atlis life is life arma 3 is life 1010 would recommend

it is a good game i love it
recommended
arma is not a game in the same way that a word processor is not a document want to play callofdutylevel stuff its got that want to play rpg stuff its got that want to play survival horror its got that want to play a flight simulator its got that this softwares so good it will convince you to strap things to your head for headtracking and that this is perfectly normal however you will probably find you get the most out of this if you play with a clan from wewanttopretendwereinthearmy level of committment to the itssaturdayandweredrunkandontheinternet level of committment to the wehavesmallchildrenandthisiswhatwedotochillout levels of normality there are clans out there for anyones taste and needs and hell if youre a misanthrope the singleplayer fun is still pretty damn awesome httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvv1pxjdunqdg
recommended
arma 3 is a great game if you are into shooters it is a hardcore millitary game and experianced players will enjoy this alot
recommended
this game is not for those who believe call of duty andor battlefield is realistic this is as close to realism as you can get without actually going to war this is a breath of fresh air to anyone who wants an authentic military feel in their games
recommended
a very fun game however the game itself has many things that need to be fixed most of them are well known to majority of people who already play this game the netcode couldve been done better too i do recommend this game however i would strictly wait until its on sale before buying not worth more than $20 in my opinion in its current state
recommended
peoples necks start glitching out in the back of helicopters 1010 would see a doctor again
recommended
ran over a hill got shot by a tank got called a noob 1010 would noob again
recommended
arma 3 is clearly a step forward compared to arma 2 interesting new mechanics and more smoother gameplay compared to the previous game but still this game could be complete  because all the bugs and dsync but all of the creative people who have made many interesting mods and missions make this game such a masterpiece i have spent so much time playing this game the community of this game is the best i have seen so far arma 3s playerbase is like one big family but then there are the s but they are kinda rare nowadays this game has made me laugh and cry so many times because the bugs and some epic and stupid moments the only bad thing i say about this game is that it is getting less realistic compared to arma 2 arma 2 has mods that make it a real milsim this game is more like slowpaced open world bf with some realistic stuff i rate this game 810
recommended
i am going to be short and sweet on this one i have been playing and following up with bohemia interactive products since the very first release of operation flashpoint one warning dont get addicted  
recommended
what can i say ive been with bohemia interactive since 2001 when operation flashpoint was born if you think day z or arma has been laggy how do you think i felt when i played ofp on a p4 800 mhz processor with a 1 gb of ram since the release of the latest update the long awaited fire your weapons from vehicles has emerged and arma 3 has moved one step closer towards its completion as for the dlc first it was karts then helicopters the next installment is scheduled for q1 of 2015 that will feature an enhancement for marksmen but that does not go without saying that arma 3 will ever see a final update for the game is very community oriented and new improvements are found each and every day if you are a fan of any sort of realistic gameplay regarding war or vehicle physics then arma 3 is for you nothing excites me more than loading up a blackhawk to its gills and entering a combat zone with my friends and other real players only to delve out utter mayhem and destruction to our enemy arma 3 is my favorite game and if you give it a chance and are patient with its occasional shortcomings then get on board and lets annihilate some targets
recommended
910 buggy but its still to roleplay every once in a while
recommended
look at the hours ive played a awesome step up from arma 2 with better graphics and a more intutive interface with more advance servers overall a great game to buy if you like military simulations or simulations in general
recommended
bohemia is presenting you the best military simulatorexperience once again with arma 3 i highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in an awesome game 1010 without doubt
recommended
slowpaced and heavily strategictactical its a game that may not be fun but it can be very immersive and tries to give you a breathtaking experience if youre one of those guys that likes hardcore realistic simulation then this game is definitely the best out there also its more than just a game its a platform that has plenty of mods to keep you busy when the original theme of the game is not quite what youre looking for
recommended
arma 3 is immersive as one of the best if not the best military simulators on the market a3 surrounds you in a variety of breathtaking environments and puts you in the center of the action youll receive radio transmissions through bursts of static hear the wind go by feel the ground shake when a tank rolls by everything from the weather and lighting down to the recoil of the gun in your hand is so finely tuned and detailed that the only closer you could get to realism is to enlist arma 3 is dynamic it has an arsenal of mods just waiting to alter the game a little more one way or another with a community thriving on creating more and more for the game the sky is the limit for what can be done no two missions will ever be repeated the same way ai learn and adapt to situations forcing you to do the same or die and with a fully destructible environment nowhere is safe until the enemy are all dead arma 3 is intense youll know this when you hear the bullets snap past your head and youre holding your dead teammate in your arms the smallest firefights can shift the course of an entire battle life or death can be determined just from which way you decide to lean teamwork is tantamount to success and unlike many modern shooters there are no lone wolf heroes no one guy rushing the enemy line and winning the game for everyone you work together or you die there is no third option arma 3 is the game you want when nothing but the best will do
recommended
fun game all the mods make it so fun to play
recommended
its arma
recommended
arma 3 is a very fun open world game it has an extremely large modding community and is widely played by those throughout the world it contains a scenario editor in which you can create your own missions for you andor others to play together it has a unique scripting lanuage which is difficult to learn at the beginning but is very flexible once you learn it the community has much variation from player age experience heritage etc and is a great game for those who really like combatstrategy
recommended
arma 3 is a game changer going from call of duty to battlefield to this and its on another level started it up joined a server and met up with my squad we rushed and invaded a small town where we were ambushed by tanks and snipers one of my teammates was screaming through his mic as if this game was real life after 20 minutes of trying to figure a way around the ambush we all got killed by a helicopter and respawned two thumbs up
recommended
i would say that the best way to describe arma iii would be to say that it sends you to war be it through having your helicopter shot down in the first five minutes of you being in the game and ejecting just in time to avoid death then crawling to an outpost on your broken legs to defend it to your death or be it in having your humvee hit by an rpg and having your commanding officers head shot off by a sniper the game is what you make it but i will say this this is not a casual game by any means if you are a fan of games like cod or bf you will not be happy with this game the hyper realism makes it often incredibly challenging to survive but i can say from experience that when you do succeed you will be as excited as ever i would reccomend most players to start out playing online because that is where most of the fun is the multiplayer modes and the variety of them make a nearly infinite replay value the games sandbox nature make it a blast to play with friends though it does lose something when playing alone i would reccomend playing with friends i give it a 810
recommended
this game has so much detail in it from the sounds to the look  as well as multiple levels of multiplayer gaming for you to play  well worth the money to get  so enjoy
recommended
was alright played very smoothly and looked amazing but when it came to flying learning to operate drones it was very confusing and not very well though out also the online servers didnt work that well was ether glitchy or wouldnt work or just wont load if your looking for a multiplayer this would be good if it worked right for single player if you like cod you might like this
recommended
this game is is the top military simulation it is the only one only problem for this game you must have high end pc standard to high graphic in cod you will play at max setting for ultra settings you need at least i7 and 2 gfx cards i play on standard to ulta setings with 40  80 fps what definitly need a big update and fix is terrain builder and other tools for making maps and mission for game i give 910 need more optimization for editor 510 need a lot more work and better setup guide and documentation too long learning curve hard to make decent maps without help from youtube and lots of forums reading and searching
recommended
probably the best military sandbox game out there quite a lot of bugs might be unstable after updates but the community is here custom contents mods are a gamechanger grab it join a serious community and enjoy the hell out of it

great game especially enjoy the role playing servers the only place someone will scream bibical scripture at you and shoot out your tyres outside of the usa 1010

this game has its ups and downs it has greatly improved since its official release as it was extremely dissapointing lack of altis servers altis servers had no guns or vehicles or rarely any no mods campaign was not available at start i did not care but to many they cared and many optimization and bug issues all issues have been pretty much addressed and fixed but there are issues that can still be fixed as they include an issues tracker in which you can report issues and recieve feedback from developers and users forgetting the few issues it has it is still a great tactical military simulator that you can enjoy with yourself your clan or your friends this game definetly became an alltime favourite for me as the graphics look beautiful even if you play on low and gameplay is quite realistic to any other game

its alright but costs as much as a patrick swayze shrine 710 no patrick swayzinator

even at 10fps still fun now thats saying something

arma 3 is that type of game where its not just a bloodshed battle but it has tactics and strategys that makes it realistic and fun
recommended
arma 3 is a shooter that breaks the arcade fps paradigm the versatility of this game engine and features presented therin are absolutely unmatched worthy of the title military simulator completely fly aircraft drive vehicles logistics with team strategy tact and disciplin this is the closest to a real combat environment you can get without selling your self to the man other big title shooters out there have gone the way of the run and gun shoot em up arcade styles and require very little forethought if you desire an experience that will rock your fiber and boost your blood pressure all the while training your brain arma 3 is the game for you much recommended for sensible mature players
recommended
great game i like the king of the hill mode they seem to be improving it really well just a lot of buttons and the steam workshop is a nice touch only downside is this games horriable engine the engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side once you start to add about 20 ai or players the engine starts to use the cpu or video card less and less cuasing a performance drop i seen maybe 30% cpugpu usage on a 106 player king of the hill match with 30  35fps hile on armory i can pull well into the 80s with a few players thats my only gripe about this game if they would fix that then i would have no complaints at all
recommended
best shooter ever
recommended
doesnt get more realistic for a military sim than this
recommended
its the greatest game i ever seen in my whole life
recommended
lots of fun definitely better than arma ii plays more like an fps since it doesnt feel as clunky as arma ii was you can attach and remove scopes and ammunition without using ammoboxes it is better trust me ing awesome
recommended
one of the best war simulator games ever very easy to install mods nice world interactive about 80% of the buildings can be destroyed nice maps cool graphics many bugs hard to control by newbies 810
recommended
the interface allthough improved can still be overwhelming i dont know how many times i have reloaded my weapon when i wanted to open a door or how many times i have thrown a grenade when i wanted to look in my backpack it doesnt help that bohemia changes the default keys for every installation of arma however this can be changed to your preferences of course another factor to consider is that it is heavy on your computer make no mistake about this if you want to view all the blingbling it has to offer it seems that its terribly hard for bohemia to optimise their engines this is true from the first operation flashpoint to dayz sa you need spend some tlc on the options to make it run smooth and even with a beast of computer arma3 can bring it to its knees without sweating with all this said i have played all the arma games in the hundreds of hours per installment and except for operation flashpoint which had an excellent campain mode the single player is not the reason for why i come back quite frankly they might as well have left it out no its in the multiplayer mode being wasteland life zombie nation or just a regular all out war session that it really shines it defines sandbox fun rarely does a game cause so much emotions and i frequently end up sharing warstories with colleagues and friend it has the feature of drawing you into the gameplay and no other game gives me sweaty palms like the armaseries so if you are prepared to spend some time to learn the game you will have a gem that litterally has a mod for anything you can think of kill zombies sure want some stealth play sure want to live your life as a drugbaron of course want some chaotic all out tankairland battles definitely and if it doesnt have what you can dream up you can always create your own content
recommended
the frames are not great but the mods for this game are pretty cool battle royale is the best one in my opinion
recommended
this game omg altis life is one of the best parts of the game you and your friends doing jobs such as cocaine heroin weed diamond oil and iron jobs and much more then going out to be a rebel or be a cop or just a normal civilian me and my 3 friends are enjoying this game alot and you will aswell and if you dont want to play altis then you can also play the campaign and that is really fun aswell im not a big fan of it but you might be this game is for every guy who likes the realistic military gameplay and realistic gameplay like the real world you can also get the dayz mod and the battle royale mod i havent tried the dayz yet but the battle royale is really good its a great mod and it should get into the game itself instead of being a mod that you can download but this game is really all the money worth
recommended
hmm i dont wanna say this but your dlc so fing expensive 14 dollar for 2 helicopters are you fing serious i cant use mini gun in helicopter cause dont have dlc what the f is this but gameplay not so bad i got a sniper i see bipod when ill use it buy dlc marksman are you fing serious i bought it 5999 dollar ill buy this helicopters 14 dollar its in your dream bohemia
recommended
great game very tactical
recommended
i am awful at giving reviews and im really stepping out of my comfort zone here just because i like the game so much arma 3 is not a game where you have to be of a certain mind set to play you just cant be spoiled people who play call of duty or battlefield will just  their pants at the idea of this massive sandbox were anything can be done but they will not enjoy the game for they have the wrong mindset arma 3 has 2 huge maps these are not shoe boxes you could play for years on years and still be finding new things on this map because the 2 maps are big it takes work to get to where you need to go and you will often enjoy the transitions yes the fun of arma 3 is the adventure you take to get to your destination in what ever gamemode or mission you play but once you get to that perfect snipers nest or sneaking up on that perfect road where a tank is just going to drive by on your mine or even if you stumble accross an enemy infantry fire team and got shot the  up its the atmosphere that really captures you success to unsuccess its a game that requires time and effort not too much effort and not too much time but the perfect blend that allows you to enjoy slight success and slightly understand why you failed arma 3 is more like playing hide and go seek with dog balls every one hides and every one is able to be taken out so when you do get shot in the head with no idea were the bullet came from its more of a hahaha you got me because killing in arma 3 is more based on position arma 3 is definantly the best game bohemia has for those who were ripped off by dayz even though they were made by the same company dayz resembles nothing of the quality of arma 3 and the people who develope arma 3 are much more competent than dayz
recommended
i personally just picked up on the arma series and it takes some getting used to but after awhile the game becomes incredible and i would choose it over any cod and battlefield the only probably i have with it is mission 13 does not work for some reason 
recommended
i had a friend gift me arma 3 and i always wanted to play it despite all of the negativity some people give it i enjoy the game myself there is so much you can do in arma 3 that sometimes it is hard to name them all having 893 hours i think it is safe to say i would recommend to anybody from super serious to very calm game modes arma has it all if you choose to get arma3 see you on the battlefield
recommended
epoch should i say more
recommended
an infinite playground feel like some competition play boot up multiplayer and hop on wasteland or tdm matches scenario play join one of the massive missions kicking around online extremely cool and unique singleplayer experiences hop on steam workshop and get one of the top rated missions want to goof around with your friends fire up a coop mission theres no game that offers you this much flexibility and this much room to stretch out in if youre an arma vet you know this already unlike the previous arma games though despite some bugs its not completely inaccessible to the public the server system is incredibly easy to use steam integration is fantastic the player models and controls dont feel like operating heavy machinery except when youre operating heavy machinery infantry controls are fluid helicopters take time to master but are a joy once you do tanks and armored vehicles are appropriately weighty if a little low on torque and climbing power at times i often wish i had manual gearboxes play arma iii youll have a lot of fun
recommended
its all fun and games until a hacker teleports everyone into the middle of the ocean rip all 42 players who didnt have a underwater gun 20152015
recommended
this game is really good
recommended
this game is just bout the most amazing thing ive ever played and the zeus dlc adds on tens of thousands of hours of gameplay onto the already huge playability factor some glitches lots are pretty funny to witness in a subtle way and the modding community is crazily active i would buy this again if i had to steep price but it is entirely worth what you pay this game coming from people who have had contracts with different governments to make accurate virtual battle enviroments for training get it
recommended
what needs to be said this is arma the penultimate of military games if you are looking for a military game get this one its based off of actual us military simulations it cant get much better than that
recommended
the best $60 ive spent this game offers so much content for the money its ridiculous not only is the campaign challenging and pretty interesting but the multiplayer game modes that come stock with arma are a blast but on top of this it has incredible mod support where players have literally created their own new maps brought maps like chernarus from the original day z mod added weapons that werent in the game via bohemias addition vehicles enemies etc it is incredible whatever you want to do as long as its in the realm of guns or cars theres a fking mod out there for it and that alone makes it worth full price any time this game makes all aaa titles charging $60  more for dlc look like  if you think you can hang and stay aware of your surroundings buy a3 its fantastic
recommended
easily one of the best shooters i have ever played more simlator then most claiming to be out there nothing like a cod or bf great game highly recomend it
recommended
best military simulation out there period
recommended
amazing forget my old review this game is gold as a arma lover i was super hyped about the game the reason i hated the game was because i only played watseland and altis life but i joined the more war servers and damn its fun
recommended
the arma series is one of the greatest i have ever played and it continues to be my gaming choice the game is for hardcore fps tactical shooters it is seen as a milsim and a sandbox game remember slow is fast and fast is slow
recommended
one of best experiences in multiplayer in my life most of times i do milsim coop so this game is worth all money if you dont expect cod or bf like gameplay
recommended
what i can say arma is always arma the ultimate war simulator if we make a difference with battlefield wellbf is for casual and arcade player
recommended
really fun especially if you play arma life or altis its a little hard to run so make sure you have the pc for it
recommended
this is my favorite game the fun is endless and it never gets old due to the mods and the game only gets better as time goes on i would recommend this game to anyone who has a some what good pc to run it 
recommended
if youre into simulator games arma 3 is for you if youre into fps games arma 3 is for you if youre trying to live a life as a virtual military dude arma 3 is for you who doesnt love a military caombat simulator 3
recommended
arma 3 is a really niche experience it is refreshing to play an arma game when the market is so saturated with mw type military shooters to truly appreciate the realism and immersion of arma 3 you have to find a good server to play on i have not played a game in recent memory that provides the realism that this one does and the community is really the driving force behind that the gameplay is solid but the learning curve is somewhat larger than your average shooter combat is not in your face but tends to be long range engagements that last a significant amount of time the single player options are decent and provide a good means for learning the game but you should not buy this game if you are looking for a single player experience my only other significant complaint is how poorly optimized this game is it is a pretty game very pretty actually but it runs so poorly on even decent rigs that it can become quite frustrating 7510
recommended
thought about buying this for a long time arma 2 was great but i wasnt sure if this was any good if you havent played arma 3 buy it now you wont believe what kind of situations occur there
recommended
heck yeah
recommended
favorite game in some years definetly recommend it lots of content with campaign scenarios sector control wasteland battle royale great game however i wish that multiplayer performance lagwise would be better optimized
recommended
fantastic only issue i have are the overly complex controls
recommended
this game is the most broken and buggy piece of  but i still love it so much
recommended
its a good game   overpoch to dayz mod is so awesome   best buy
recommended
i would totally recommend this game for those who have the money p
recommended
10 10 full paced action packed real good graphics military simulation deffinatly would recommed for people to play 
recommended
br is one of the better mods
recommended
like most of the reviews of this game on steam this games first 30 hours will be the most painfull time spent trying to learn the basics with that in mind i highly recomend this game to those who played the first two games in the arma serise while the learning curve for the game may take some new players days to learn it is a game that can not truly be judged by how difficult it can be when first getting into a game you will realize that the games controls can be extreamly difficult to learn but upon playing for 30 hours you will learn all of the in and outs of the complex controls many would be quick to assume that this is just like any ordenary shooter were you run to one objective to the next shooting everything in your path in arma 3 this is simpily not the case getting into your first only match you will realize that there will be some situations that may take you 10 minutes of sitting there and waiting for the enemy to make the first move needless to say this game is extreamy hardcore and should be part of your library if you enjoy stratigic games that require communication with other people to win what is good graphics gameplay online gameplay community what sucks learning curve serverside lag large system requirments my score 87100 a must buy for those who love stratigic 1st3rd person shooters  170hrs of playtime at time of review
recommended
incredible coop good community best fps game i ever owned
recommended
if you never played operation flashpoint arma 1  arma 2  day z mod  day z standalone or any other military shooter this game is not for you and if you have this is the best military simulator ever made
recommended
love it simple as that

this game is the best openworld military simulation ever just gotta love this game d d
recommended
a beautiful looking game with realism at its finest great gunplay and well polished campaign multiplayer is incredible tons of mod support through steam workshop and countless support for third party mods like battle royale its worth the money if its on sale and i couldnt recommend it enough

what call of duty wished it was what battlefield strives to be what arma already is czech republic10 two developers got wrongfully arrested for taking pictures at a greek air show because of this if this game can spark a coupe then you know its good

best game ever i love it but dont buy the game if you dont hav a high end pc 
recommended
excelent simulator game really fun if you are a military type
recommended
do you love 10 fps do you love bushes that can blow up trucks do you love buying dlc that is overpriced then this is the game for you welcome to arma 3 a game that can give you hours of fun while making you ask yourself why you paid $60 for the game and $15 for the dlc this game will give you so many funny memory about how you drive on a rockwall with a tank and exploded and hit a bush with a truck and your wheel broke i have a top of the line graphics card processor and internet but i still cant paly this game on highultra and get about 25 fps best war simulator 2014
recommended
ive played dayz and this game totally beats it with the customization available there is really nothing bad about this game there is occationally lag spikes and fps drops but thats probably just me great game
recommended
after 200 hours into this game and playing in the aplha i would still reccomend arma 2 there isnt as much in arma 3 as its counterpart way more items in arma 2
recommended
amazing military sandbox game that lets you create anything you can imagine
recommended
great game there is a alot mods
recommended
beautifull extremely well designed now that the mod community has gone completely bonkers with solo coop and multi maps and missions this game is beyond measure please do not go into this blindly arma3 is a patient game a game requiring a very nicly oiled pc and players that play the solo missions to learn the controlls before throwing the nubness at the pros this community is patient to an extent and rightly so this game deserves you to give it respect and time learn its kinks and you will be greatly rewarded by being apart of victory earned by all not by one
recommended
this is one of the greatest game out i play a3l all the time is alot of funlirikforlife
recommended
hard to set up and get used to at first but once you get to know it you will love it 
recommended
awesome game if you played bohemias other games in the series arma 2 and arma 2 oa then you have to get this the graphics are beautiful although you need a good computer obviously to run it well the combat still feels a little stiff but its a huge improvement from the last games they added an actual working physics engine and the features inventory system gun attachments etc are top notch the use of tactic and strategy is required so if you like that kind of stuff then youll like this its still a pretty early release so im sure they will be releasing more vehicles and guns soon also it comes equipped with the steam workshop which is amazing considering steams community is great at making modifications that make the game ten times better just get the damn game already

my friend shot me in the foot and left me to die 1010 but in all seriousness arma 3 is a beautiful game and is tons of fun there is a lot to do with this game from booting up the editor and having you and a group of friends do a mission to helicopter flight practice playing arma 2 with the dayz mod has really gotten me into arma and i enjoy it
recommended
best game to waste money one period
recommended
epic game take your time in learning the controls and gamemodes many mods and countless hours of fun

fuken climb in the bushes m8 shoot the biches get the girl alright

arma iii is not a love hate relationship it is a relation comprised of ruthless and merciless defeat and frustration this game made me pour hundreds of hours of my life into a virtual world where i only die i could not recommend this more to someone who wishes to experience what its like to be a complete failure playing arma is like when you swap from cod to battlefield except you are being constantly reminded that you are vulnerable 1010 would bearing 000000
recommended
first off this game is amazing it has something to suit everyone even though it is a military simulator this is because of a dedicated community of modders so if you dont want to be a soldier get on an altis life server and fish or something if you want the fight a gladitorial battle to the death try battle royale if youre into zombies there breaking point or overpoch if you want a strict pvp mode that plays similaryly to bp or overpoch get wasteland there is so much that this game has to offer that i couldnt begin to list it all this game like every other is not without flaws however unlike many games the dedicated community of modder also takes care of that with their own patches and fixes seems like bohemia interactive did everything right with arma 3 and the opposite with dayz standalone
recommended
amazing game especially if you play with other people and use teamwork i havent had this much fun on a game in a very long time d
recommended
love this game love it how it is set and everything

simply the best militry simulator on the market even if you dont like that aspect you can play the famous mods like wasteland and altis life you dont even need a mod manager for that arma 2 its defently an improvemend to amra 2
recommended
best game in the world

was a great leap for the engine beautiful lush lands await you the ai needs improvement constantly being fixed the overal content of the game is there with some bugs along with the supporting community you will get lost for hours in just about any server catering to a plethora of gametypesindividuals whether that be realism passing time with friends or just flying around to enjoy the scenery this game helps build good relationships with other players through teamwork and roleplay as well as provided likeminded people with a place to call home rip dis

one of the best military games ive played so far alot of fun and always on your toes never let your guard down enemys could be anywhere in co op missions playing this game with jsrs dragonfyre makes the sounding of the battle even more realistic it will make you think youre actually there overall rating 9510 overall great game and recommend any player who loves tactical shooters to get this  stay frosty see you on the battlefield 
recommended
arma 3 is one hell of a game the shear possiblites are limitless you can kill and be killed in so many ways i give this a sure  thumbs up
recommended
such an awesome game myself i like wasteland mode the most dbut i hate life mode _ because i have no idea what to do on it
recommended
its a game
recommended
died and became a seagull living the dream 1010

arma is pretty well the everything simulator want to shoot some terrorists want to shoot some zombies want to shoot some dinosaurs want to run around town and get harassed by cops want to make some drugs and sell them want to build a house out in the woods and do inappropriate dancing all night long sure gameplay can be frustrating at times but a fair tradeoff for near infinite replayability
recommended
stole a cop car of a squeeker hooned around town and pulled poeple up 11 out of 10

worth every penny fantastic military simulator
recommended
the free weekend trial was enough to convince me to buy this game
recommended
this game blew my mind it is hard as hell but fun at the same its nothing like cod or some easy  like that the game where you actually have to concentrate on what you are doing rating 1010
recommended
the most played game from my library thats says it all
recommended
i dont even have the game but its allowing me to write this i win
recommended
1010 most fun ive had in any steam game
recommended
the best military simulator on the market its the only game where one or two bad guys at the right time and in the right situation will get your heart pumping my goto game highly recomended to anybody who has played a military shooter and thought i wish i could do x and y doesnt matter what x and y are the majority of the time you can do it in arma
recommended
this is realy epic game you can play in altis life patrol ops and the best of all is breaking point something like dayz but on arma 3 d
recommended
love it amazing
recommended
awesome game here it has so much more potential than games such as cod or battlefield which are mainluy liniar games on arma theres no straight line thinking its like a giant sandbox with huge maps and vast mods and gamemodes to suit everyone i would suggest this to anyone thats on the fence about the game or prefers a break away from cod and battlefield a solid 1010 from me
recommended
very good game with good graphics and its worth getting
recommended
if you are looking for a harcore tactical pc gmae look no further arma 3 is the shizzle
recommended
this game is not for those who believe call of duty andor battlefield is realistic this is as close to realism as you can get without actually going to war this is a breath of fresh air to anyone who wants an authentic military feel in their games
recommended
difficult to master but awesome to play realistic army sim
recommended
best game on steam
recommended
the closest youll ever get to real combat in a video game be prepared for slow paced gameplay compared to other shooters because thats how it is in real life once past the initial learning curve arma 3 provides some of the most rewarding gameplay out there community mods increase this games value tenfold
recommended
i dont even own this game 1010 id play it again
recommended
good game can do almost anything thanks to the modding support i strongly recommend altis life a3wasteland and possibly arma 3 epoch when it gets out of alpha
recommended
i give this game a 1010 i have 400 hours on this game 350 of those hours ive played other 50 hours went to afking its well worth the money becasue you can use mods on it and run different missions the replayableity is endless now i only played wasteland but there is more things like life and stuff now i have played arma 2 free so i know how to play the game only thing i dont like about it is the lack of firearms cars helis and planes if you look past that though its a great game over all its quite social
recommended
hands down best sandbox
recommended
this is the best game its just gets boring when you dont play with friends
recommended
this game is freakin sick just buy it people
recommended
something for people who like tactical realism not for the cod fanboys sorry cod fanboys ^_^
recommended
the preeminent military simulator multiplayer and the mod community are where this game shine incredibly deep and sometimes frustratingly buggy persevering lends a rich experience
recommended
absolutely incredible game a sandbox more than anything else with practically limitless possibilities whether you prefer to role play simulate actual battle scenarios or simply blow stuff up with advanced modern weaponry this game can cater for it all whilst you do get some performance issues especially on lower spec systems they are really nothing which should put you off i recommend this 100% to any gamer
recommended
great game i bought this after playing dayz standalone and having never played the dayz mod or arma 2 the most realistic combat game i ever played a must have 910
recommended
you liked arma 2 youll love arma 3
recommended
yes i recommend
recommended
first of all this game is amazing if you like military games realistic stuff vehicles big map pvp there is much more this game is for you if your bored of doing missions you can always go and play other gamemode like king of the hill in which there are three teams and one town and the team who can hold off the town for the longest wins there is altis life in which you make money by selling drugs mining etc and then spend the money on stuff you can rob people gas stations and become a cop rp its a really fun game to play i would rate it 9510 because of some fails in the games mechanics its still a really fun game to play with friends or alone
recommended
nice game controlls are a bit ed up but you get used to it d

the latest in the arma series this is the best military simulator out there and it sure does live up to the hype with a fantastic graphic upgrade apart from just upgrading the graphics it has created 2 new maps for you to go crazy on in this sandbox military simulator where quite literally the sky is the limit engaging close quarters combat entertaining infantry combat with a load of other people and ai with vehicles to back you up the amount of scenarios you and your friends can experience is endless due to the thriving community that has come from arma 2 and operation arrowhead to make these games even better whilst even without any mods this game still lives up to the standard that is expected from bohemia interactive in this long running series of military simulatorsandboxes they added new movement new weapons new vehicles whilst no classic weapons like the m4m16ar15 series dont make a return along with the ak477474su they are replaced with new weapons that are more towards the future the game itself is set in 2035 when the republic of altis and stratis is facing a civil war nato comes in and attempts to help the aaf in the war against csat they are turned on and the aaf teams up with csat to destroy nato forces in this gripping fight between yourself and loads of tough ai in this futuristic settings along with new weapons new toys have been added to your arsenal to mess about with new vehicles include submarine type transport vehicles amphibious armoured personnel carriers and scubadiving equipment it all totals up to a crazy sandbox experience with a load of missions and scenarios from the community from altis life to wasteland
recommended
this game is so amazing its made to be a fun military simulator but its so much more there are game modes for every kind of person or all people let me name a few rpg zeus big team wasteland epoch and much much more the community is great there is nothing wrong at all to say about this game just go ahead and buy it okay i have a cool story just to tell all of you guys this isnt my only one i have alot me and my friends are in a gang war with some enemies and have been searching for them throughtout the map or an entire hour we eventually decide to do a drug deal with them because the drug traders arent safe we go to the airport and i set up in a tower to watch over while my leader is outside the building and my frends are outside all of the sudden our leader gets taken out and to guys go over to loot his body in the meanwhile theyve got a heli flying over and guys infiltrating the building my friends are in i immediatly take the two guys out from the tower and move to a different position one of my friends was shot in the building and the other took the enemy out we eventually clear out the building and the heli flew away i hope this helped you really need to gett this game its worth well over how much they price it at i also wanted to tell everyone that this game isnt about the gameplay its about the experiences you have in the game 1110 would reck a squeker again
recommended
this game is okay said no one ever this game is boring said no one ever this game is too much like call of duty said no one ever the mods in this game are awful said no one ever this game is awesome said everyone ever

just purchased arma3 on the 50% of sale i have to say i am a huge arma2 fan but i was blown sky high when i started playing arma3 the reviews somehow just did not do it justice for a big arma2 fan i actually did not know if it was that much different form arma2 i was so wrong arma3 is better in every way so far weapons graphics sound player interaction ui menus etc etc i have only had it for one day now and it is by far my best pc purchase in a long time also i have bought into all of the survival games on ea to which even though i am happy to support the games i chose to support none of them have become fun to play for me i like dayz mod and let me tell you breaking point for arma3 is the answer you get a zombie game plus all those vehicles and weapons the epoch servers are also so much fun in arma3 vehicles everywhere on some of them planes helis tanksetc so much fun good job bohemia interactive and good job to all the modders out there

arma 3 does a good job at improving many aspects that were lacking in their previous versions most notably in my opinion is the ability to dive underwater without dying helicopter flight dynamics seem to have improved although they are still not realistic i would like to see vortex ring state now implemented with helo dlc thanks limited power during hotheavyhigh altitude operations and a wider ability to slingload realistic loads partially implemented in helo dlc thanks bi into battle
recommended
if youre looking to implement tactics this is the game by far i highly reccomend this game to anyone wanting to escape the mundane fps genre
recommended
arma 3 is awesome especially battleroyale if you dont have this game you need it
recommended
i recommend this game to everyone that is searching for realism and authentic experience

this game is fun in its ways being it is a new arma from the series which sold so much on arma 2 rip but anyway the game will keep you entertained if you are new to the game series if you are a returning vet from it then you know what to expect my first impression was this would be a whole new game not the old one mixed with new mechanics such as new graphics new units new nations and a fun moderator twist you can create units basicly be god but the game nation to play that only in multiplayer and editor zeus yes i said it zeus the game makes it funner why i will tell you why in editor i used to have to create units and when they were dead i would have to abort and restart where as in zeus you can create new units on a dime such as if a tank of mine died in an unfair way i could enter zeus and put another warnings about the game the game for me is very buggy at some times crashes in random fights ones even only having about a squad and it does it the controls are also hard to get used to it took me a good 2 hours to get used to the feel from the switch it does from arma 2 the story you start out in a island run by nato and the aaf new indipendent nation mainly aaf and you have basicly a coup de etet or easier versions goverment overthrow where the aaf are crazy and you have to survive and link with other units on the island all major bases on it were destroyed you start as a young so i think anyway sgt named kerry he goes through losing his commander well his squad leader anyway that is the basics i am not going to spoil the rest  the main conculsion i love the game but it needs work i know it has been out only a few months but it needs major work in my opinion i would wait until it is on deal or it lowers price a few $ it is not worth $60 but yes i would recommend it
recommended
arma 3 is a great game but need some fix bugs in the game
recommended
authentic
recommended
love this game

i ran into a rock and broke my legs i fought battle without pants on i drove a car at over 250 kmh down a hill hit a rock and then flew over 100 meters into the air if you like glitches times where you question your existence and you also like to see what it feels like to sprint into a fullscale war without pants then this is the game for you theres also realism too arma 3 9510
recommended
best army game ever 1010 trust me must buy
recommended
want a game you can play for years and have no limits to what can be done with this game 275 hrs and counting and i still find new stuff to do all the time only cons are as always with arma optimization blows but quite honestly i probably wouldve paid $200 if thats what they charged its that good
recommended
ive pondered purchasing this game many times over the last year ive never played an arma title i regret not purchasing it the first time it crossed my mind
recommended
this gameooooh this gameis amazing its a firstthird person realistic tactical shooter if you are a person who plays call of duty and think you can run into a room witha sniper rifle and g37 th053 sw33t yy360quicks20p3s 1addersta1ls then this game is really not for you the campain is meh but the multiplayer is where the fun comes in you have altis life a sort of rpg gamemode patrol ops my favorite where you look for enemy encampments or chemicals and deal with them teamdeathmatch and tons of others if you have played previous arma games you will know that the controls are a bitoddwell in arma 3 they are still kinda odd but they are better there is an entirely new mechanic in 3 called the stance system basically if you are standing you have four different poses that can help with almost each and every situation same goes for the four crouching and four prone there is a decent range of weapons and atachments and no limit to clothing options the one big and noticable problem with armais its optimizationthe game doesnt run well on some systems for seemingly no reason
recommended
went on the breaking point mod dayz and i was instantly hunted down by 6 men in a chopper i ran to the first house i saw picked up an axe and axed the first man to come in i then proceeded to grab his gun off him but was shot in the head they then proceeded to say the only reason this is happening is because i had a brown player model 1010 would brown player model again
recommended
this game needs a good pc but its worth getting one for it being a sandbox moddable game its less of a game and a engine for tons of games once you mod it has every option to play from super realistic as much as a game could offer to halo type games
recommended
awesome enough said
recommended
wow this game this game is like marmite and personally i love it when i play this game i can play it for months and months i can also leave it for months and months and then happily return to it the sheer amount of things you can do is incredible and the amount of user made content is amazing
recommended
played the beta not the full game badly optimized and bad engine like dayz but its really fun
recommended
excellent game 1010 excellent graphics and gameplay if you get this you must try altis life and king of the hill they are both excellent gamemodes and you get alot of action from them would recommend this game to anyone
recommended
amazing best game i ever saw its a must in the video games world
recommended
so hardcore my pc melts down after playing it for a couple of minutes so cool that everytime you watch the trailer it gives a chill effect so tatcital it can be considered a strategy game so wanted that my friends tryed to stole my pc to play it so innovative and accurate game mechanics that cod looks like kids playground its arma 3 gentleman one of the best and most realistic military simulator title out there i wish my pc could handle its awesomeness to play it
recommended
noice game
recommended
while some may disagree this game i find it a whole lot better the physics of the bodys and the whole interface is quite realistic as to were in arma 2 they all had the all hail death animation and while being a little glitchy the game is super optimized so if you run arma 2 on medium or high expect to run this on ultra with very similar preformance disable some of the antifiltering this i would give a 910 its a great game and will be sure to waste some hours of my life in this game all in all buyitjust look at the graphics and tell me this game dosent look sexxayyy
recommended
really good game really recommend playing roleplaying mods they are so much fun

recommended
twas good to play a very nice fps game with good mechanics graphics sound and design always adored the arma series for its fair realism only thing i have against this game is the fact that the enemy ai has pinpoint accuracy and includes a bullet sponge feature while your squadmates have absolutely no accuracy compared to the enemy and they seem to die as fast as the player then again it might just be a quirk that i havent caught up on great piece
recommended
dis game is duh best  game ive ever played i got butt  multiple times duing my play
recommended
a must have game
recommended
arma 3 is an improvement over the previous generations but the game still suffers from a clunky interface and lackluster ai for an arma fan like myself though it is the best arma so far
recommended

recommended

recommended
great game you should really consider getting it 
recommended
make arma not war
recommended
yes with over 20 guns and 12 vehicles i r8 88
recommended
despite its flaws the infantry combat is two steps up above arma 2 adding much needed fluidity to once an extremely clunky interface that coupled with the inclusion of play withsix granting users an easy way to access the hundreds of usergenerated content a requirement makes arma 3 worth getting at full price
recommended
absolutely great game you can do pretty much anything
recommended
good game good game you know what a mother ing good game 910 for gameplay 010 for people with bad comps cause you cant run this  trust me join a group and do events lots o fun yeah swag
recommended
great gameplay fantastic graphics and amazing player made missions lead to hours of gameplay even without the full single player campaign
recommended
hard and glitchy get the hand of it and youll have fun remember most arma games arent complete until about 2 years after release
recommended
amazingly beautiful graphics and breaking point is one of the best game mods ive played i really enjoy the king of the hill gameplay in arma 3 too the only downside is you need a very rad computer mainly cpu to play this without horrible lag i recently upgraded to a 4th gen i5 and a gtx 750ti which has greatly improved the playability of this game
recommended
antitank simulator fences are the main weakness to every vehicle in the game remember this also trying to jump over a trash can will instantly kill you 1010
recommended
very nice fixed what arma 2 had problems with still has some small problems physics fps lag but really its arma get over it
recommended
this is an amazing game with many game modes a bit of dsync but its amazing i love the multiplayer and so many mods import mods to mods the compleastly change the game and need arma 3 as a button altis life arma 3 is a fun multiplayer mission you can join the altis police department apd oor join the rebelion  and if you are a fan of mods arma 3 life will be the mod for you still work in progress for 2014 and well the missions and the helping you out mission thats just the cherry on the cake for this game i recomend you buy it whiel its in a sale or just buy it anyway thanks for reading enjoy the game
recommended
this game is truly amazing definatly worth the money the campain is dinamic allowing you to go on patrols or scouts after every mission and the story line is amazing  not gonna give too much away but you are cpl kerry from bravo squad stationed on the island of stratis staying behind to make sure all nato elements evacuate the island  unfortunaly things go south and they get attacked by  forces independant and leaving kerry alown with his sgt they get saved by a british squad who moved onto the island and fight to recontrol the island and i am not saying anything futher exept for that the editor has been redone  looks alot more fancy and the customiseation options in the game are well done  zeus is the best thing i have seen in arma 3 and i truly love to use it  now if you still reading you havent bought this one hell of a good game
recommended
the long awaited follow up to arma ii a lot of stuff has been improved upon graphics inventory stances physics ai and more still we need to fight the somewhat cumbersome interface and sometimes strange performance dips but for fans of military simulators this is an obvious buy and you will have a lot of fun in this amazing sandbox
recommended
this game is a lot of fun with a great set of multiplayer game modes
recommended
i wish i had someone who knew how to drive a car
recommended
one of the best games i have ever p[ayed i love this game
recommended
while i would reccomand this game i am dissapointed in bohemia interactive for making the game more arcady then the previus arma 2 game while the controlls ware refined and improved the graphial fadality is amazing the game lacks in content and optimization a major issue being the fact that if the server host is experiancing 8 fps so will you no matter how many nividia titans you rig together and how many i7s you overclock to  while arma 3 is alot more complex engaging and immersive then olther tittles out there such as carl on duty black cops and battlefield it is indeed a thinking mans game where map reading team co ordination and communication are key it does not acheve the level of immersion and simulation that arma 2 with mods such as ace and acre acheive i defenitly reccomand the game to newcommers to the arma series but arma veterans may be dissapointed to newcommers arma arma allways had quite alot to take in to learn to unlearn things you are used to doing in first person shooters it requires them to learn to use their compass to alert friendlies of contact how to operate as a team and even how to operate their weapon system in a proficent manner accounting for distance and target movement but somethings will be new even to arma vets such things as the stance adjust system and the awful arcady grenade throw bound to g to any arma 2 vet trying to fiddle with his gear thats bad news
recommended
this is an awesome game to play the developer team is really caring about the community the workshop and map editor helps you to do a lot of things that no other games can the hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium plus if you one of those people who play cod or battlefield a lot you may need a few hours to l2p this game arma 3 is seriously an simulation game any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distanceand the ai is pretty good at aiming stay in cover move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island
recommended
let me start off by saying this game is great and the workshop makes it 20x better but in order to give a good review i must give both sides of the story this game is very complex and can be intimedating for the noobie but one of the greatest parts about this games loyal comunity is that no matter how stupid a siduation might be they will still role play it out that is partially why this series seems so realistic the community is great of coarse there are always those people who would rather complain about how bad someone is instead of helping them to become better but most people are willing to help with anything you might need the next thing is to learn the controls it will make your life so much easier there may seem to be many controls but you only use a few of them unless you are a commander also this game is beautiful and usually runs desently well on a mid range pc now i must give the downsides the campaign is ok but it is not arma 2 quality that is the main theme here is that it is not arma2 i dont know why but this game is missing something that both arma2 and arma cwa nailed it seems more directed and controlled that previous installments of the series one will need a mid range ish pc to run this game all in all this is a great game with a wonderful community and it has endless mods from the workshop so if you are debating weather to get the game or not let me make the decisioin for you get the game
recommended
the best war simulator i ever played worth to buy
recommended
its a good game 
recommended
this game is a ultimate military simulater
recommended
i have never had a game i played more than this one this game has so many mods and game modes
recommended
the graphics was actually good
recommended
best dance simulator in history
recommended
jog endlessly accross vast landscapes and get killed by people you never saw reminds me of all the things that sucked in the real army the community also emulates all the retardation that surrounds the operation of armed forces if you want tedious hours of boredom unforgiving gameplay a friend circle of maniacs and so forth then yes please do purchase this game great game i love it a must have

arma 3 teamwork and the amazing spotlight had a blast last night working together with my squad and never knew how deadly the spotlights on helis could be during the first round of king of the hill there was only about 30 players total so i took to my beloved hellcat chopper to help spot the enemy for my squad another teamate flew a pawnee with rockets and guns and as i found targets hiding in kavela i would call out thier location and within 15 secs or less our pawnee would come in and lay waste to the enemy we dominated everyone that round it was daylight so spotting was pretty easy and if the pawnee couldnt get to them our ground forces would move into the area to flush them out the entire team was working together calling out targets waiting for the incoming rocket barrage the next match was even better same map but night time with almost no visibility on the groundthis is where it got really fun i switched on my giant spotlight finding and hovering over targets waiting for the pawnee to swoop in and take em out we must have gotten 30 kills this way i felt like the police going after criminals spotlighting enemies as they ran from building to building cover to cover trying to hide form my spotlight after a while they figured out they needed to hide from that annoying heli pilot shining a giant light in thier faces so many times i would find an enemy on rooftops trying to hide where i would come in and light the whole building up they were getting soooo mad would either have to run and hide or would try to shoot my light out so they werent so exposed which of course never worked out in thier favor many times i would follow with my light the enemy from building to building across the city tracking them until our forces could kill or flush them out in 20 years of gaming this has to be one of the best gaming experiences in my life the pawnee pilot even mentioned he felt bad for killing them after i would spot them the enemy knew if that light found them they were done for its funny something as simple as a light could be so fun and deadly1010 for amra 3 heres a quick video on how to get to the ao faster than your opponent gaining an advantage during the entire match view it on youtube in your regular browser for hd httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwhzplf5wbmu another in game dropping guys off httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfees1rcjsby

gourgous game 1010 would eat cupcakes with
recommended
arma 3 is perplexing actually on the surface i find i tend to sit around and do a whole lot of nothing when playing standing around and driving from point a to point b is the norm however there is a certain quality that makes it terrifically addictive i dont know what it is but i enjoy the game thoroughly there are plenty of exciting moments and when youre done with a match that often takes hours to play youre filled with a sense of accomplishment i dont even need to mention the community around doing mods and such it adds to the game immensely 1010 would play again

bought some lsd in altis life ran from the cops when they noticed purple smoke coming from my truck and hired a getaway helicopter only to find out i didnt have the helicopter dlc i got arrested and went to jail for 11000 minutes the guy in the helicopter tried to break me out of jail i only then realized that u cant get in copilot if u dont have dlc i am not a wanted fugitive and have 3 bounties of 10million on me 10010

so youre laying behind a rock listening to bullets crack by and looking out a few feet to your side at the body of your buddy wondering if hes just passed out or if hes been killed like the rest of your squad was suddenly all you can hear is the roar of the a164 cannon as it screams overhead and the sky goes red with the fire from explosions you peek out at the burning remains of the enemy forces and breathe a sigh of relief for the first time in the last hour those moments are why you play arma
recommended
extremely fun and a bit of an adrenaline rush at times if you are playing wasteland or koth recommend playing with a crew and get some comms up for the ultimate experience i plan to spend more time pew pewing baddies and taking their loot quite and amazing amount of detail in the game sometimes im amazed at the littlest things i see in game
recommended
this is not you usual run and gun shooter youve been warned be expected to die and walk a lot
recommended
this game is a whole new meaning of awesome the succesor of the very fun arma 2 arma 3 is beautiful and lively yet at the same time can become a giant battlefield of fun and thats why i love this game if this hasnt convinced you to get this amazing game well youre missing out
recommended
most realistic game ever
recommended
yea this is amazing if you like blowing  up flying  driving  killing
recommended
very entertaining but has some problems such as some of the worst optimization and lack of content that they try to sell to us in dlc but is overall a good game
recommended
this my first ever game review so ill try my best basically what you get with arma is openworld warfare the size of the maps and locations in arma bring it to life more than a simple call of duty map the graphics are beautiful and show off the true extent of pc gaming simple things such as the movement of smoke whilst flying through it with a helicopter or jet pay off big time there is a huge extent of weapons and vehicles to choose from to explore the vast world multiplayer is fantastic with there being many altislife servers out there such as eugl or darkside gaming these online servers give you the oppurtunity to make it big as a drug smuggler or serve altis in the police forces and work your way to higher positons my only let downs with the game is the drivingflyingboating physics and controls it definately isnt the best game when it comes to vehicles with the steering feeling delayed and sloppy and the damage can be sometimes ridiculous there was a time where i drove a vehilce into a tree at around 10 kmh and it blew up then another where i crashed a heli out of the sky and everything was fine besides the rotors so to sum up the game if you are looking for an openworld warfare with a great multiplayer community you should definately give it a go even though i have never played this as a singleplayer game it still gets an easy 810 from me\\ hdwizzard

ill write a review later im busy playing arma 3
recommended
such a great game im thoroughly enjoying the campaign at the moment but i love the different multiplayer scenarios and stuff 1010
recommended
so far i have put hundreds of hours into arma 3 i spent most of it on a game mode called altis life which i am sure most of you have heard of it is incredibly entertaining but that is not all that comes with arma 3 i recommend the campaign for its interesting and fun story alongside some awesome gameplay you wont see outside of the campaign there is also wasteland you can try as it offers constant pvp while aiming for interesting objectives and i also recommend battle royale that you can download from play with six over all this game is absolutely worth the money i personally spent 20 on this game when it was on sale and i do recommend purchasing it for around that price as 35 is a bit much and if you got to sites like  you will get it for a nice price so yes please do yourself the favor of purchasing the game as it will bring so much more to your gaming experiences
recommended
excellent graphics and fantastic team play if you want a game that is realistic and fast paced then this is the one for you there are also chances to go solo in several multiplayer servers if thats your style
recommended
i think it is a epic game
recommended
if you love military simulators or just plain out love the military this game is by far the best out of any other game to play i have played arma 2 and oa and ever since arma 3 came out i have not touched arma 2 or oa this game has a learning curve but ask people in multiplayer or play the campaign for help overall 1010
recommended
awesome game major improvements especially the voice acting because in arma 2 it was horrible to listen to although there is plenty of random crashes this is afterall alpha so it has time to be improved but just from the alpha ive had a great time
recommended
always a fan of the arma series and i love to support their games and continue to be a supporter for a long time keep up the good work <3
recommended
having played arma 2 for almost two years before arma 3 came out i had high expectations for arma 3 now before i get into specifics about the game i have to say arma 3 is one of the best games you can get without having to buy any dlc to enjoy a full experience arma 3 is an amazing first person shooter that involves a bit of strategy to win whether it means inserting into an enemy camp via sdv or hiking it across altis just to take an enemy helicopter for a spin you have to come up with a plan to have a successful mission now arma 3 isnt just about objectives and killing virtual entities arma is about a massive multiplayer community made up of players mod makers scripters cinematics creators and many more if you think vanilla has an extremely large amount of content wait til you get a look at all of the mods and missions created by just the player base pros extremely fun and adrenaline pumping gameplay crazy amounts of mods available extremely large and diverse player base very well made models and objects high end graphics not very many hackers large amount of servers to choose from lots of updates cons physics can sometimes be a bummer when attempting unusual missions or actions can be hard to run for some people can be a little hard to learn how to play again physics overall i give arma 3 a 1010 this game has exceeded my expectations i can replay this game everyday for a week and still not want to put it down if you are looking for a first person shooter that involves a crazy amount of strategy and content this is the game for you
recommended
even better with the steam workshop addons highly reccommend
recommended
arma 3 where to start amazing modding community huge multiplayer milsim communities eg shacktac ingame mission maker zeus advaned flight model new to the game firing from vehicles new to the game nice campaign 2 maps but the modding community have more tactial game longrange firefights really realistic not like cod or battlefield it has really unique gameplay good game 1010
recommended
this is an amazing game as a fps as well as enabling the player a truely immersive realism experiance the multiplayer experiance of the game is truely second to none with community members contributing maps and missions to the steam workshop as well as community modders hard at work the potential for this game is quite limitless
recommended
if you have to read a review of arma 3 to decide whether or not to jump in buy the game seriously youve played shooters before im sure and youve thought to yourself i wish you could do _______ enter arma 3 where doing _________ is what you do whatever you can imagine you can do if it doesnt come out of the box someone has probably made it mods team play and strategy is what its all about youre not usually playing against other players instead you play with other players against some of the most realistic ai i have ever seen all arma games to date have been amazing but arma 3 takes a leap simplifying the controls while providing more and exciting options for the seasoned player it is truly the culmination of all weve wanted in a decade of arma buy it youll love it there are too many features to list here but lets just say youll get in and youll never get out
recommended
i love this game but i think alot of people underrate it

i hardly play multiplayer in any game dunno why i just dontarma 3 is one of the three games i player multiplayer in heres a story that as part of a pmc team i deployed into a contested area to eliminate an hvt our chopper got shot up extremely bad to the point where one pilot and both gunners were kia and the remaining pilot was struggling to get it on the ground we proceeded on foot and got savagely attacked only after twenty minutes of trying to not die did a jet arrive and rake the area with bombs once the area was cleared we verified the hvt and stole a luxury car to escape justinsane the realism of arma 3 coupled with the fact that i was fighting alongside guys halfway across the world who were just as invested into the mission as i was made our plight that much more intense as a veteran of the arma series i can attest to the progress bohemia has made in arma 3 almost almost everything i griped about in previous games were fixedincluding some that actually made me stop playing for a while i was a little  at the lack of units at first but then i remembered the crapton of usermade addons avalible in the workshop and on armaholic i now have units from the cold war up to the vanilla units of the future i can play any war that i want and i cant think of any other game that can do that the island of altis is huge stratis is pretty big but mehits a fruit fly compared to the budgie of altis look up the difference its a suitable comparisondont you judge me theres a lot of space to destroy with a variety of different areas allowing for different combat you can do anything from marching across a shallow river to an intense firefight in a city the variety of fighting is outstanding being able to fight as a soldier then go to a tank commander then a gunship pilot and a plane pilot then to a special operatorits outstanding ive played in usermade campaigns where you literally cover every aspect of the war to sum it up its like starring in a dozen war movies on your own if youve got patience and a desire to learn you can take a spin at the mission editor it has a steeeeep learning curve itll require some serious investment to get good at ive been playing these games for a while now and i still havent mastered the editor im good but i cant do some of the insane stuff others have this allows for almost unlimited replayability once youre done with the vanilla campaign and whatever custom ones you downloaded you can simply hop into the editor and make your own now time for the gripes theres some aspects of the game that aredifficult to cusp mostly in the editor i feel like the game is actually all that finished yet i wont go into detail about this but theres features that dont seem all quite there yet i also dont appreciate minor dlcs being thrown out there with only a bit of content i liked it better when bohemia released a dlc with an entire new army and several new maps like operation arrowhead which was actually standalone british armed forces pmc and army of the czech republic i havent sunk any money into them because im holding out for arma 3 panasian war or arma 3 world war iiior something of that strainsomething with new armies maps and weapons instead of just a few new features to specify im not saying that the dlcs are bad but im not willing to pay for them until something monumental comes out all in all this is an outstanding game without peer say all you want about cod and battlefield i love both franchises and have sunk many hours into their various incarnations but they dont hold a candle to the glory of armed assault if youre a serious gamer this is your game military fan this is your game modding fan this is your game microtransactions to restock energy and make moves screw off and go back to your phone youre not welcome here and wed prefer if you kept your microtransaction covered fingers out of our bowl of steam score for those of you who like numbers and slashes they get my motor running something about it just really gets me riled up 910 ps for those of you who had arma 2 theres a lot of ported content on the internet i personally have the vanilla maps from arma 2 and its expansion packs its pretty damn cool going back to takistan and chernarus with the updated engine

i love this game and have played with it for almost a year i do recommend for anyone who is into tactical and teamwork based fps
recommended
probably one of the best fps military simulator with endless user addon and mods i have ever played in my life its to the point this game is the only one i still play its far from call of duty and sort of reminds me of the old battlefield games but better i give it a 1010 not for the game only but the the continuous community and their mods
recommended
i cant complain this game delivers on what i was exspecting i have all other games in the arma series aside from a small few of the arma 2 expansions i love the ballistics you get a more realistic feel for how a real firearm operates there is much more to take into account than your simple fps the series is great and worth a try the controls can be intimidating but they are managable if you invest some time in training and getting a feel for it this is a simulator so things are gonna be alot tougher than your typical war game the ai friendly ai could use some more fine tuning and tweaking i have had to put a few bullets into a couple insubordinate ai team mates for laying fire on targets a 1000 meters away thus helping bring more aid and attention to the base we were originally assaulting the game is not without its bugs and it is also a heavy on your processor much like arma 2 was but indeed it is definatly a step up in graphics it could use a larger armory but there is a great mod cummunity that works on things like that to help the process along cant wait to get my saitek x55 rhino pro hotas to be able to enjoy the helicopters alot more
recommended
i absolutely love this game mainly for the mods to it i really enjoy playing rounds of battle royale it is even better with a few teammates it can get pretty intense at times i do like their breaking point mod it can get pretty intense 1010 gameplay experience

the most dangerous things in arma 3 are as follows stairs ai rocks teammates the car you are driving the enemy

my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game ever were on our way to the objective a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces im leading a team of 4 men we come to a crossroad and i sprint across telling my men to hold back i cross a few more times trying to get a response from any snipers nothing i run my saw gunner runs my medic runs but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through remember the sniper scene the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down he then takes two more in the chest the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills he played it up to 11 here he screams as hes being shot crawling drenched in his own blood sarge you aint leaving me out here like this right ii wanna go with you guys cmon sarge hhelp me cmon please dont leave me he died after that i cried and he respawned i would recommend getting

arma 3 is a very diverse game with many different games modes and mods some of the popular gamemodes are king of the hill battleroyale and wasteland there are also many cooperative mission you can do with people if you choose to do so you can instlal different mods like guns vehicles missions and other things then theres breaking point a mod that involves zombies be warned it is a very big download like 20 gb it can be hard to survive people and most people will try to kill you so be warned last note is there is going to be a arma 3 epoch namalsk map coming
recommended
this game is one of the rare game that has always something new the community is big and has a lot of modders you will always find something to do but i warn you it doesnt run smoothly often and for me this is the only problem i hope you will consider buying it if you are looking to play for tones of hours and fun see you on arma
recommended
this game is a fun open world game if you have money and you like military play this game

awesome game if you like arma 2 you will love arma 3 despite the amazing graphics it plays pretty well and there is a ton to do id say buy this game but at a risk of you may not be able to run it considering its such a cpu intensive game i hope you enjoy it like i have though have fun

very good and fun army simulator never get bored

so much fun playing the game along with friends the single player has alot of fun working with players to take down your enemy
recommended
fantastic game love every minute of it
recommended
i personally dont know what to say because writing a really long review is stupid but i highly recommend this game by far one of the best games i have played in my lifetime the great mod support the variety of gamemodes to choose from its just simply great buy it
recommended
its arma ii with better graphics dont get me wrong thats not a bad thing  looks great the graphics are excellent sharp textures and nice lighting  real virtuality 4 a better engine  mod support this is what makes the arma  series unique  an okayish singleplayer  multiplayer battleroyale in particular   the futuristic setting doesnt feel futuristic at all it feels boring the rhsmod fixes this but still  a little variation in the weapons all nato guns look and feel the same a on of bullpups in the game aswell  multiplayer issues the servers performance affects the players performance meaning if the server runs like crap and is filled with script expect your framerate to tank a lot  clunky animations  vehicles are like paper not much bad things to say about this game the mods will keep this interesting for a long time 910
recommended
very nice game and very good
recommended
very fun game and good mods 
recommended
i really do love this game its great when you have a group of people to play with but not so much for solo play it lacks a wide range of weaponry but the mods help fill in the gaps left by bi recomended if you have friends toplay with
recommended
there is nothing more to say about arma iii than wow ive been an owner of every single installment in the franchise from the days of the original operation flashpoint the leaps and bouds that the developers have made over the course of the years is astounding arma iii is absolutely astonshing as an improvement from the rest of the series its far less buggy than its predecessor and is updated very regularyl the multiplayer capabilities are awesome and you can lose many hours with your friends developing all kinds of scenarios if you were a fan of any of the previous games this one will not dissapoint
recommended
if you liked arma 2 then you will love arma 3 because it is arma 2 with better graphics and less content i bought it so should you 1010 will have to create your own game to enjoy the game you just bought
recommended
this game was a bit frustrated after counter strike but after a few hours of playing i realised it is not so bad it is a totally different and i must learn how to play this game after a while i understand the flow of the game so now i like it much better i recommend this game for those who like open area combats and slow gameplay compare to counter stike it is more like real world
recommended
dont mistake this game for an fps some people enter into this game expecting cod its not arma is a full battlefield simulator which it does well at in arma youre not meant to feel invincible if you dont take cover youll die if you dont communicate with your squad youll die it has an insane learning curve that will take most people a long time to get used to but only makes it very satisfying once you finally figure out how to fly or use artillery oranything the complicated controls at first can seem annoying but once youre used to them youll be grateful you can stick your head up just enough to see an enemy out of a window without exposing your whole body the games modability makes it possible to play an infinite array of game modes making it difficult to get truly boring while there is a battlefield like mod called king of the hill the size of the maps alone makes the game vastly more complex and thats saying nothing of the array of vehicles that can completely alter the game from just one player knowing how to fly or range a sniper rifle unfortunately the arma engine is well known for how glitchy it can get most of this has been ironed out and the presence of hackers ruining servers has been greatly reduced since early access at times clipping through a wall or falling through the floor of a building still happens but its not so common that it ruins things at the end of the day the game requires being patient and on your toes while communicating what you see with teammates the different mods and game modes give the game infinite potential but the glitches can create issues sometimes arma 3 is a military sim not insert fps here dont get attached to scores and if you find yourself complaining over global that someone using a plane is cheap or a noob close the game and reevaluate who you want to be in life
recommended
really good game with a large number of mods buy it and play it
recommended
fun and open world game with really good gamemodes and lots of fun make sure your pc can handle the game before you get it though
recommended
great game they should add a runescape mode so i can mine and cook my way to level 420 9910 ing  m8

the most realistic fps military simulatior around the ability to mod the game makes for an endless amount of ways to enjoy the game i have stopped buying other games on steam sale because i find in the end i dont play them because i spend all my time on arma
recommended
great gane definately recommend this i like playing rp servers and being a rebel so much fun great millitary sim as well
recommended
arma 3 is an incredulous display of what the real virtuality 4 engine is capable of graphically and in sheer scale there have been massive improvements to the game the sound engine animations and even tree generation have been revamped also who could forget the implement of physx and directx 11 yes the netcode is still being worked on yes there are bugs in the gameplay arma is always going to be arma most of the problems we experienced in arma 2 are almost completely gone or unnoticeable in arma 3 bohemia interactive is heading in an outstanding direction with the arma series lets keep it that way
recommended
so i have played many hours and i like it a lot so have you ever wanted to run around while looking at your feet making it look like your sucking your own  brake dance shoot a guy in the knee and laugh at him because he cant run anymore run in to battle in your undies note theres a bug that doesnt allow you to go naked do a back flip in a chopper get into a tank lav and go down the highway at 100kmh then hit a rock and go flying and a lot more who said this was a war simulator you can play this game your whole life and not need to shoot one bullet remember men play arma btw lots of people wont like this game because they dont know what to play on it find what modes you like or make your own
recommended

this game looks gorgeous on ultra settings and is great for benchmarking this game requires a hefty rig to run stable 60fps 1080p which is a big factor on whether you take a risk on purchasing the game if you have a low end system the multiplayer is very cpu intensive and could lead to unexpected drops of frames even on the most beefy of pcs this game however is packed with singleplayer content and a large variety of multiplayer modes the game also features a mission editor so you can make your own missions or download them off the steam workshop with the peformance issues in mind this still is an amzing game and is worth a fullprice purchase if you have friends which can play with you on it 910 great game but lowmedium end rigs or even pcs with a not great cpu be weary
recommended
great game  myself over the graphics
recommended
oh arma you treat me like dirt yet i still want to be in you walking the thin line between love and hate

an incredible creation for those with right tools i simply cannot reccomend this more to those of you with a good amount of ram and a half decent graphics card otherwise you are in for a hard time i like to look at games on how good they can be not how good they are on a crappy little emachine on arma3 i have had some of the best memories in pc gaming thanks to the great community that plays it and the ahrd work bohemia interactive has put into this masterpiece pros active modding community great graphicsattention to detail engaging and exciting storyline with memorable characters cons you will need a beast pc to have an enjoyable experience pricey dlcs some issues with fps bi says it is related to the engine and will be optimized overall i really do reccomend arma3 to the military enthusiast to the casual fps gamer enjoy
recommended
one of the best games i have played a must get for anyone with a pc also one of the scariest games i have played to as the campaign made me feel like the character and it felt like i was actually fighting for my lifethe multiplayer is one of the best parts of arma 3 as there are plenty of servers which are completely different so the game is never repetitive which means you can spend hours and hours without getting bored the community are amazing in this game before when i was a noob pilot a guy taught me how to fly and he also helped me if i had any trouble by taking over the controls

gr8 gme luv gettin sick killz careful tho easy 2 die be safe

watch the showcases theyre old but you should be able to find them theyre about 14 minutes long and show off lots of cool features including disguises and much more this game is not finished and needs to be updated still
recommended
arma iii is a great game very buggy at times but at its core still very fun wasteland and altis life are probably some of the best parts about arma iii they are super addicting to play especially wasteland would definatly recommend the game
recommended
the most amazing military simulator game out there also a great game unmodded as well as modded this game has brought many players together through communities and clans 1010 no doubt well done bohemia
recommended
the little time ive had in arma iii really goes to show that this is a very heavy milsim game and is amazingly fun highly realistic with great and smoth controls that never get in the way arma iii fixed arma iis more clunky controls and added different stances besides standing crouching and prone this adds a new dynamic to the game and allows for things like cover that would be useless at the standing and still realvealing at crouching you can crouchprone or crouch very lowly much lower then normal crouching which makes combat more dynamic and much more fun the only thing in arma that is a killer is stamina because it its a milsim game stamina will always be your number one enemy and more of the threat in a fire fight then the guy shooting you because you cannot steady your aim
recommended
super graphics and multiplayer very big map and a lot of technique and a lot of weapons arma 3 the most realistic game i put it 1010
recommended
its the best
recommended
this is a game where you can do what ever you want make it a fps by playing tdm or make it a role playing game by playing mods or life no matter what age you are you will enjoy arma 3 the best one out of the series and i would buy this game for my friends just make sure your rig can run it though otherwise it gets a little less fun
recommended
its good
recommended
i have just started to get into arma 3 and i have found it exclent but you are going to need a really high end system to run this game i would recommend at least 8 gigs and an i5 and gtx 750 ti and above
recommended
battle simulator like no other it is as realistic as possible massive modding options which gives many different game options want real warfare simulation you have it want faster more like bf gaming style go with king of the hill game mode want to fly shot people with tanks coordinate strategy you can choose all that and more
recommended
if you like war simulaters this is your game
recommended
arma 3 is a tricky game to review but heres me trying it anyway the reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player i take arma 3 for what it is first and foremost a platform what you get is a good looking game with a solid would be great but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance engine two amazing maps stratis and altis which is probably the most impressive map ive seen in any open worldish game and the prospect of near endless new content from the community what you dont get is an easy to get into milshooter with cod sized maps and a quick pace if youre in for uncomplicated fast paced pvp gameplay you should probably look elsewhere if youre sick of that however arma 3 might be just your thing the strength of the arma series is freedom  yeah you are free to mod the game into almost anything you want create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience you have to invest some time into the game but once you got into it the opportunities are endless want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more arma is just your thing and there are big communities in many different languages that will help you find that epic experience want to play singe player well if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on then arma 3 isnt the game youre looking for or is it right now bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign  those missions are challenging offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but dont expect a good story or interesting characters but as mentioned before  the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime personally i prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends already the steam workshop has countless missions for 25 players so should you buy arma 3 well id certainly recommend it if any of the things i mentioned above sounds fun to you it is to say though that this game is not something that everyone might like so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it i hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by arma 3 please note that im not a native english speaker so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some
recommended
without a doubt the best milsimgame ever made
recommended
just get it just get it you need this 1010 no doubt

this is not your basic fps its a military simulation with great graphics good logic not like have a health bar or heal after getting shot and like nothing happened nice gameplay cool campaign and multiplayer amazing mods etc

hello potential buyer looking through the reviews why should you buy arma iii out of all the first person shooters when cod has basically destroyed the genre well let me tell you why you should buy this game arma iii is a realistic military shooter that simulates every real life thing you would experience in real combat realistic physics bullet drop weapon zeroing fatigue every little item simulates real life combat this game is in my opinion one of the best military fps shooter out there alongside halo battlefield and battlefront arma iii is first person and third person and features 40 weapons assault rifles lmgs smgs sniper rifles marksman rifles but alas no shotguns yet last time i checked and over 20 vehicles tanks apcs transports and helicopters it features several weapon attachments and several body armors and uniforms to choose from the game is stunningly beautiful you wont find a more beautiful detailed game the developers put a lot of work and time into graphics and boy did they give you what you pay for it features 2 large scale maps span across 274 km of terrain 16 million placed items50 towns and cities with such high detailed really requires a good computer i have a asus republic of gaming computer with a geforce gtx 860m and it usually runs arma at a smooth 60 fps in almost all places including heavy combat and cities but my computer doesnt work well when it runs high detailed modsmissions from the community so if you dont have a good computer you probably should wait till you have a good computer but fps and graphics aside its a very beautifully detailed game when your computer made for these types of games i have rarely ever ran into any graphics bugs or any poorly textured items aside the random long necked marine in a helicopter or the pure white eyes of marines while the games story faces criticism i think its a well planned thought out story a story you would expect from a war between nato forces and the local csat and aff forces in the year 2035 the storyline is split into 3 acts and each is extremely long so youll be sure to get a few days out of it i wont go more into just so i dont spoil it the game features showcases and a boot camps so you can learn and play with the basics of the game weather its ground combat air combat or showing off new things in the game boot camp helps introduce you to the basics of the game before i go into the controls let me say about one of the things that greats arma iii great the steam workshop community allows you to download missions and mods that adds some really great stories to continue and add some really great and new weapons or uniforms and some really great maps some like wasteland and remakes like wwii and remakes from arma ii & oa the community in arma iii is helpful and not once have i ran into some angry little child like i would in cod most people are mature and friendly players who help out and dont yell at you or trash talk the community is great and friendly and the developers and game makers listen and help the community out unlike some other games moving onto the controls and game play to put it bluntly this is not a friendly game to new players you are going to have to spend hours and hours learning the controls and learning how to play because of the realistic gameplay every single thing you do needs to be carefully planned out and played the controls are complicated and you will take a long time to learn and play them and when you do play you will use almost every key on the keyboard while playing the game this game will beat you up if you dont learn the controls or try to run and gun this is not call of duty there is no running and gunning to survive youve got to move up cautiously use cover pick out targets and control your accuracy which can be controlled with armas 19 different stances to improve concealment and accuracy so if you want a fast paced shooter where its easy to play and just shoot people and they die arma is not the game arma requires patience you have to work to survive and get those most wanted kills but when you do you will be filled with satisfaction tanks and apcs and helis also require skill communication and the same caution used in ground combat and air travel is no easier as much as i want to do a cool strafe run with an attack helicopter i cant cause ill likely get shot down the multiplayer really makes this game bohemia really put their heart and soul into and boy did they make it great arma iii has one of the most largest diverse multiplayers of all the fpss the servers are great and plenty of ones to choose from one of the ones ive been playing the most is invade and annex made by someone great who i cant recall feel free to comment the maker of that great game mode and be sure to check it out yourself however the ai in this game still need improvement enemy ai can either be dumb and take 50 bullets or shoot you dead center in the head and kill you the friendly ai are a bit smarter but usually rely on you to hold your hand and kill your enemies however they are usually very helpful and smart when they want to be but usually work best under well with a good a squad leader the enemy ai can be deadly and coordination but are sometimes stupid so you must treat them just like you would any other real player ai will most likely see improvements in the future and possibly personality traits such as feeling when over run or less likely to stand still and take bullets or savage bodies or take abandoned vehicles i understand that $5999 is a lot of money to pay for a game thats been out two years but trust me i can say without a doubt every dollar and penny is worth it the developers and game designers spend every penny and dollar improving arma iii and they regularly update the game however if you are struggling for money just wait for armas regular sales arma iii will fall to $30 and im sure after long enough it will drop into the lower twenties and even lower the dlc however is a different story i got both dlcs with the recent sale and saved some money while i like the new helis and guns in the marksman and helicopter dlc i believe that they could have already have been in the game its overpriced i can agree and youd be best off either not buying it or waiting for sales hopefully more ground vehicles and possibly shotguns will be included and hopefully wont be as expensive on a later note the zeus dlc is very fun and really adds new gameplay to the game unlike others to put it bluntly think of battlefields commander but with more power and control way more so as a returning veteran from arma ii and oa i can say without a doubt and confidently that arma iii is one of the greatest military shooters out there equally standing up there with halo battlefield and star wars battlefront this is arma iii one of the most visually realistic military shooters of all time you make the stories you fight the battles you decide the out come will you stand defiant with your team mates and tell your stories or will you become another causality of the battlefield i give arma iii a 910 or on another scale a 95100 survive adapt and win this review will be updated as time goes on for previews or perhaps a better outlook on the game go here > httpsyoutubeph1mm2kksv0

really good game all my freinds must get this fun game
recommended
really good game to play with your friends although i was playing on a server and it seemed to have max players on it there was 2 servers and my browser seemed to stop working after a while so i had to restart the whole game then refresh a couple of times then it would stop again thats really the only probelem the coop is amazing  it almost reminds me of planetside 2 when you have a squad and there are mortar strikes and everything works out anyway i would recomend this game to alot of my friends 
recommended
i have to turn out everything what i said it took a little while to change my graphics settings to good and now i just can say that this game is a very ing good but i just hope that this game will be optimized better to pc
recommended

it reminds me of games with guns it is a good game with guns

huge learning curve but once you get it down you can basically play any game in the series the editor is immensely difficult to learn to use as well but offers more options than any other game i know of i would say probably about 400500 of my hours on record were spent editing game modesthe only huge issue i can really think of off hand are the animations which are inexcusably subpar in my opinion it gets annoying when you shoot a soldier and see him begin to slump to the ground only to have him instantly snap into the upright position it seems arma doesnt have any animations for when soldiers take damage so it instead opts to ragdoll the soldier into a death animation for about a half a second before setting back to the healthy state this is very annoying as it makes confirming kills difficult and unlike arma 2 where semiautomatic weapons were ideal you now need to spray at your targets to ensure they are actually dead and havent just begun the death animation and will soon reset to the ready position other than that for the most part the game is very well done

twas good to play a very nice fps game with good mechanics graphics sound and design always adored the arma series for its fair realism only thing i have against this game is the fact that the enemy ai has pinpoint accuracy and includes a bullet sponge feature while your squadmates have absolutely no accuracy compared to the enemy and they seem to die as fast as the player then again it might just be a quirk that i havent caught up on great piece
recommended
a really great military simulator the amount of content and detail in this game is great and will give you hours of fun to have from a great sp campaign to a diverse and intense mp along with co op missions with friends there is endless content in arma 3

incredible game love every bit of it its worth the money the ai are better than what i experienced with arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead for sure the physics are incredible
recommended
arma 3 is really good but the mods for it are disgusting and bad

this game is incredible its a military nerds dream with an engaging singleplayer character customization multiplayer ranging from rpg gametypes to full on military sims and an overabundance of player created content and systems for you to create your own content this game and its community really create something special

recommended
unmodded oh god it hurts ignoring  lp bait mods like altis life wasteland and dayz arma 3 modded is one of the most enjoyable milsims out there and i fully recommend it as long as you dont mind spending first few hours hooking up mods and scenarios which make the game infinitely more fun with huge amount of replay value
recommended
aside from being horrendously cpu bottlenecked you wont find another title like it any where else if combined arms is what you want look no further

arma 3 is an amazing military simulator that treads a line between ultra realism and arcade shooter while the strange controls and not so easy to adapt to type of tactics may seem intimidating dont let that put you off this is an amazing game with a very powerful editor and tons of multiplayer and singleplayer scenarios on the workshop and with the game you will have a lot of fun

to explain this game in one word is imossible it just simply is ths is becuase arma 3 is the only way to describe the game but crane what does arma 3 mean well its not one meaning its shooting in intense realism its flying with only what can be described as perfect elegance and precision its role play like no other game can deliver and its mods which in its self is a whole other topic the game is expensive but the issue with that word expensive is it applys to the quality of the product if its expensive for what it is its not worth a second thought but if its researched watched and reviewed as it is the price tag is a mere penny compared to the thrilling nail bitting and frustrating war simulator so crane is it worth it well its not is it worth it its are you ready

very glad they had a free to play weekend as well as an awesome weekend sale got into boot camp and being a hardcore battlefield player i was hooked immediately wow im looking forward to some really good tacatical game play with my friends

this game is absolutly amazing it took me about 2 to 3 hours to figure out how to play and everything but dispite that this is a really fun game and if you are looking for a military sanbox rpg with stunning graphics and amazing gameplay then this is the game for you
recommended
great game but i want to get it so i need it to be cheaper
recommended
good apart from the framerate if a gtx 770 is normally only just managing 30 fps this is rare normally in the 1035 region you are doing something wrong
recommended
in altis life i got to collect drugs and my liences for it but i ran out of time because the server went restarting 1010 would collect my drugs right before server restarts again
recommended
greate for team play

ive always been a fan of the arma series right the way back to cold war assault arma 3 is a brilliant step forward and there are some good improvements since arma 2 which i was very happy with i am able to play this on my laptop hp pavilion g6 intel core i3 and the graphics are very good i would like to upgrade to be able to enjoy the higher end graphics however this game is still incredibility realistic overall very enjoyable very realistic and lots of fun
recommended
realy good game lots of gamemodes and lots of rp servers the downside of the game is that it has fps problems but some times it not the game but the gamemode if you play a 70 player rp server then yeah the fps sucks but if you play a deathmatch with 20 player like battle royalits a mod  its not that bad and it has a lot of nice workshop content 1010 would like to kill some one again 
recommended
same ole arma if you enjoy the series its worth a buy active multiplayer community
recommended
being a big fan of operation flashpoint from way back when this game is a great replacement for it if you are tired for the arcade style casual fast paced and no skill requirment of modern games ie cod and bf and want something that requires skill timing know how and realism then this is the game for you must like opflashpoint it isnt for the faint of heart at start lots of keys lots of actions you need to know but with like anything else put the time into it and you can do it huge steam workshop community lots of add ons which means more free content dont like something make it yourself this game is great fun though it may not be for all its great for most think of it as the eve online for shooters nothing beats playing mp and being a good transport pilot to get your troops to and from battle or respawns you can actually make a difference
recommended
this is a really really great game and worth every penny very enjoyable with friends
recommended
a game filled with fcking campers watching the gun store with sniper rifles killing unsuspecting players traveling to meet up with their friends to do the same thing also there are people yelling on sidechat on sector control which is also another camping ground for snipers there are also no shotguns and you will be bombbarded by jets and arrowplanes
recommended
a game which i have clocked nearly 1000 hours on and have still not gotten bored of it have had it for a few years now and because it is so open to the community to modify it always has something new 1010
recommended
unmodded oh god it hurts ignoring  lp bait mods like altis life wasteland and dayz arma 3 modded is one of the most enjoyable milsims out there and i fully recommend it as long as you dont mind spending first few hours hooking up mods and scenarios which make the game infinitely more fun with huge amount of replay value
recommended
high quality stuffs
recommended
great game

i love killing people and selling drugs in this game awesome game 100000000000100000000000 great game who ever the hell made this
recommended
big difference over arma 2 very fun and can be challenging online play is amazing
recommended
before playing this game you should ask yourself  what military operation would you like to play do you want to be a sniper do you want to be a part in a big combined arms operations do you want to ride a tank helicopter kart do you want to be a civilian and simply roleplay your wild dreams do you want to play as a god really there is not much to be said about arma that has not been said  yes there are bugs yes it is still a bit laggy but it gets better and it will get better because developers still update game and listen to fans feedback you can have hundreds of mods do whatever you want to do or simply follow missions it is all up to you this is main difference between other military shooters  it is a sandbox concept which means you are buying lot of games in one
recommended
great game so many game modes its hard to get bored
recommended
its awsome you should try it
recommended
great mods great game 910

if you prefer a slower paced methodical tactical shooter this is for you there will be hiking driving flying recon firefights etc if you are put off by the pace  style of other shooters like counter strike or call of duty this might be for you a couple things to mention the graphics are phenomenal but you will need a decent rig to max out every setting and it still might not be worth it also noteworthy there are some amazing mods for this game tons of custom missions and whole new game types like epoch mod and altis life my only complaint is that the dlcs are very questionable
recommended

reaching my 200th hour on this game made me decide to write a review to start this game has hooked me for 200 hours of tactical combat over the last 45 months or so yes i did buy it at christmas so what i came to this game from its prequel i mainly played wasteland but did a bit of domination i loaded that game up on christmas day and the main menu music already had me hooked i browsed for wasteland servers and oh boy did i find one started up as blufor and noticed my teammates were actually not shooting me which was a variation from the prequel also the ui wasnt  and navigating felt more logical i soon discovered 77th jsoc and then i have spent all of my free time on that wibble if youre reading this never let that guy in the amv7 again he tkd my whole squad  ing great game and half decent community but the bugs plenty of laughter to them and theyre no longer game breaking play this game or i will forever hate you

i enjoyed this game immensly and found it to be immersive realistic and a good simulator of war 810 review arma 3 is an openworld tactical shooter video game developed by czech studio bohemia interactive for microsoft windows it was released on september 12 2013[3] arma 3s storyline takes place in the mid2030s during the fictional operation magnitude a military operation launched by nato forces fighting in europe against eastern armies referred to as csat cantonprotocol strategic alliance treaty led by a resurgent iran with a coalition of other middle eastern and asian nations[4] set more than 25 years after the events of arma 2 in 2035 nato forces deployed to islands of the aegean sea are trying to hold off a massive csats offensive from the east during the singleplayer campaign the player takes on the role of a us army soldier corporal ben kerry initially the player must survive on his own after friendly forces are defeated in a failed nato operation during the campaign the player will face everything from lone wolf infiltration missions to the commanding of large scale armored operations the player will be able to choose different objectives and weaponry such as uavs artillery and air support according to their play style[5][6][7] arma 3 takes place on the aegean islands of altis formerly lemnos[8] and stratis of greece in the mediterranean sea the islands feature photorealistic terrain and water environments altis is the largest official terrain in the arma series with ground area covering approximately 270 km2 the smaller island stratis expands over an area of 20 km2[9] the islands also feature over 50 villages with buildings that are both penetrable and destructible in 2030 civil war erupts on the mediterranean islands of altis formerly lemnos and stratis killing half of the civilian population rendering thousands of them homeless and causing a refugee crisis under harsh conditions nato peacekeeping forces deploy to the region to secure peace and establish joint natoaltian armed forces aaf bases on the islands five years later with nato investment in the aegean dwindling the cantonprotocol strategic alliance treaty csat a military alliance of eastern hemisphere countries begins subsidizing the aaf and mobilizes its own forces in the pacific facing political pressure to withdraw at the end of their peacekeeping mandate nato begins reducing their forces causing tensions to rise between aaf and nato forces

easily the best most polished installment of bis arma series ive been playing bi games since 2001s operation flashpoint its amazing to see how the same engine real virtuality has evolved over the years errrr decades actually wow its been a while  now i feel old so in summary arma 3 is a complex and realistic simulator that allows players to realize the rapidly impending date of their last breath to know that every second that ticks by their billions of cells die just a little bit more their neurons demyelinating and their arteries incrementally hardening its a firm unyielding grip that death has upon us he authoritatively clutches the keys to the universe in one bony claw and simultaneously our hearts and souls in the cold phalanges of the other thank you arma 3 for revealing the terrifying reality of my mortal existence in death we are infinitely alone no one to hear our trembling wimpers as we rock back and forth in the dark corner of an unending void of pure sterile black nothingness that warps us further into catatonia score 1010

arma is my life there really isnt anything better if your looking for a fps dogfighting and cas missions or a massive tank battle this game is for you will arma again for the rest of my days thank you bohemia this game raises and surpasses the bar of excellency

arma 3 can and will be frustrating to start out with rest asured it is amazing you just need to do the following 1 look up dslyecxis guides to arma 3  particularly the movement and shooting guide httpsyoutubeg8vrbznyewmlistplqed6zrloafwtrq4eaykl6z23hvclygw6 this will give you an overview of how awesome movement can be in arma when you understand it 2 dont start in the campaign at least dont get frustrated if you find the campaign hard to start with 3 instead i suggest going on a domination server particularly if you find one that has infinite sprint most if not all will let you test out weapons and play on a team of other players against ai you will quickly get a good feel of the teamwork in the game and you can ask players ingame if something isnt working for you most importantly if you are stuck far away you can respawn at a base and start again without the tediousness of walking simulator that arma 3 can be 4 when you get better branch out and try more hard core version of missions there is hours and hours of fun here to find you will eventually love walking simulator 2014

waiting forever at the terminal to get a squad to head to landing zone found a squad went to landing zone asked if i had explosive charges i said yes asked if i had mine detector i said yes squad leader decided we would blow up radio tower so we went to the radio tower we spot a few enemies on hill but dont engage we finally get to the fence of the radio tower i check my inventory where is my mine detector i then realize i accidently left it in a crate back at terminal i considered telling them but didnt want to be the one who ruined the entire mission so i headed into wire surrounding radio tower and luckly the engineer with us actually had a mine detector so i could see some of the mines i somehow make it to the base of the radio tower plant an explosive and get back alive we hide behind a rock i set off the charge we hear the explosion then nothing the radio tower didnt fall so then i get to go back and place more my luck has by now run out and i get blown up by one of the mines im dragged out of minefield and saved by medic so then i get to go back again kaboom dragged out saved my medic squad leader yells at me to be more careful i reply im doing my best i head back in for the third time im almost to the radio tower when i hear a strange noise then i realize i can literally hear my heart beating the whole situation was apparently very stressful for me i somehow manage to get to radio tower then and plant 2 explosive charges then i also got back out alive we blew it up and it finally fell down i was rewarded with a large notification in the top right corner saying enemy radio tower down they cannot call for cas i thought it was going to end there but nope we got sectors to capture we were leaving when we got fired at by enemies on the hill our marksmen was shot and we engaged the enemy i tried to take cover behind a rock but unfortunately was shot time to wait for the medic to revive me again so after that everyone was alive and ok and we went to go take over some wind turbines we got to the hill where the turbines were at and more enemies were on the hill we exchanged fire for a long time our marksman got injured again so we had to drag him back then some luckly enemy got a headshot on me killing me instantly before the medic could revive me i lost connection and my adventure was over moral of the story check your damn equipment before you leave the base

endless fun possibilties and challenges for anyone who likes the arma series or likes to fight in a realistic enviorment this is the game for you
recommended
arma has a love hate relationship but overall is a fantastic game
recommended
terribly optimized graphics engine but still very fun to play high frame rates arent too necessary in this game because your typical encounter is a much more realistic than bf4 distance which is usually 300m or more since bullets actually kill fast like in real life when hits are scored close quarters encounters are short and deadly clearing a building is actually dangerous unlike bf or cod and usually theres no lateral tracking to be done since people move slow compared to the absurdly unrealistic bf or cod games so 24 fps actually is quite playable in arma 3 i can play gta v on near ultra settings on 1080p at 110 fps to give you an idea of how poorly arma 3s graphics are optimized as for gameplay the game has a great story mode and awesome multiplayer dogfights in jets arent the stupid 60 mph dogfights like in bf4 but rather youre doing 300400 mph while trying to stay on his tail ive actually damaged my plane and pilot taking a nearly 9g turn to dodge 4 incoming missiles after i ran out of flares yes aircraft have realistic quantities of ammo and fuel as they should if you plan to fly anything you must have a mic and most servers require teamspeak which is lame since the game already has global side command group and vehicle channels along with direct communications proxy voice there is no need for ts unless if youre a braindead  who doesnt know how to utilize the ingame channels however you will find yourself short of servers to play on if you dont respect the admins most of whom play nothing but arma 3 and have a god complex stroke their fragile egos and all will be well for you weapons arent balanced which is nice because they arent balanced in real life in real life weapons are designed to be the best at the role they were meant for and thats how the weapons in arma 3 are coded the only balancing is the weight penalties ammo for a 50 cal or 127mm amr is freaking heavy in real life and so it is in arma 3 if you want to be a sniper using those big guns to score 1shotkills from 2 km away you can but if you weigh yourself down with ammo you will become easily fatigued and your movement will be dropped to movement slower than an overencumbered elder scrolls character that brings us to the map size of the most popular map altis altis is big big big here [40mediatumblrcom] is a toscale illustration of altis compared to other wellknown large maps i used to try to describe battlefield maps to cod players by saying an entire cod map would fit into a bf home base well caspian border fits nicely into the nato air base on altis the little islandlike peninsula on the southern part of altis is just a bit smaller than skyrim yeah altis is big 270 square kilometers of land 16777 square miles and a total playable area that supports gameplay on land air sea and under water of 1000 square kilometers 62137 square miles making altis bigger than fuels map yeah its bigger than fuel nuff said so im getting bored of typing this so ill wrap up with saying this game is awesome if you like huge openworld simulators that openly supports modding speaking of which there is a hao mod thats right you can play halo in arma 3 i know you can play as odsts and unsc marines but im not sure about spartans and covenant as i only just got the game and i havent tried the mods yet i give this game a 810 loosing 2 points due to graphic limitations

my mother would probably scorn me by saying this about any media related to war but this game is magnificent beautiful epic and brilliant the soundtrack is not too bad either i absolutely love the way the game controls especially compared to the stiff nature of its predecessor arma 2 this is particularly noticable when focusing on vehicles in other words the vehicles handle like a dream due to the improved physics model physx apart from the third party physics engine implementation the engine seems to have seen new additions and reconfigurations such as the improved ai still not perfect especially when driving the textures are decent considering the scale of the game but definatly an improvement over arma 2 animations are miles better the details of objects such as weapons vehicles and various common geometry scattered around the large expanse of the two vanilla maps stratis and altis are great i find great delight in oogling at such a realistic landscape which in the case of the vanilla maps apparently are modelled from real locations agios efstratios stratis and lemnos altis there is a lot of content on offer with arma 3 notably the zeus gamemode which is really exciting to play its when a player takes control of sort of an rts perspective defending attacking and messing around with spawning objects and ai while other players run around as normal soldiers adapting to the unpredictability of zeuss actions its quite a fun game mode and no two sessions are the same there are a load of other standard game modes along with the ability to play scenarios either made with the editor workshop or built in ones such as escape from altis which is one of my favourite scenarios provided by bis its great to play with some friends in fact with a clan or a load of friends this game is a lot more fun dont get me wrong the single player content which is similar is also really really good speaking of the single player experience one of the most notable additions to this iteration of the series is the decent campaign missions are good and diverse making use of the space it has to play with as well as the good voice acting which seems to immerse me into the war torn greek islands of stratis and altis despite all the good things in the game of course it has problems one that sticks out like a sore thumb to me is the performace relative to the hardware also the fact that the game does not seem to spread the workload across all four of the cores my cpu has to offer the ai only take one thread causing servere framerate loss when trying to play with lots of troops running around which is what i enjoy doing in sandbox games like this most of the time servers seem to have problems too as connecting to a friends has failed on multiple occasions seeming to be randomly stubborn towards other players joining your server despite inviting them this is no casual shooter this is a military simulation this is arma3puts glasses on gets up walks off into the distance <obligatory 1010 ign mlg 420 reference>

its very very good if youre not a total ing scrub that is look at the tips at the bottom of my guide to not be wrekt heres an overview of your multiplayer gamemodes altis life its like darkrp from gmod but much more tedious and boring drive for 40 minutes to go get some peaches then sell them and buy a gun and commit highway robbery there are sometimes fun setup but mostly is just boring this game is for real combat not dumb pistol fightouts over fruit oh and the s theres lots of  and rdmers king of the hill theres lots of  servers for this one try to find a smaller better one thats not so popular level up your soldier dude and buy vehicles and guns and  to destroy the noobs wasteland my favorite gamemode very simple actually you buy guns and vehicles to capture cities and get money to buy tons of stuff takeout money shipments by working with your team to get money to buy tanks or whatever theres 3 teams blufor opfor and independent opfor and blufor have teams that work together most of the time independent creates very small groups or just lone wolf and kills everybody usually just for campin a hill killing both the defensive and offensive teams its the real combat gamemode play altis map its much less messy tips dont use third person unless your like looking out a window for your enemies or something you cant be accurate in this mode use cover dont go rollin around in the middle of the street like an idiot you gonna get capped shoot from cover and then go back into cover also beware of what youre using as cover because some stuff can get penetrated through depending on what caliber the s carrying get cozy maybe camp a little campin aint no shame because it teaches losers not to run in the street dont be a  about it though like camping the ing gun store  or you can use tactics using cover to find your enemies who are sprinting in open plains of grass oh dont run too much youre not sonic you will become tired and inaccurate when you finally spot the idiot you wanna kill also use machine guns if youre new because they puts lots of bullets down range and it requires skill to shoot accurately finnaly watch videos and  on how to do stuff use vitural reality thing to help you as well as editor to teach you how to fly drive swim run shoot and etc buy this game its so much fun thanks for reading my dumb guide i took time to write for some reason if you wanna support the developers buy their dumbass ing dlcs it probaly helps them or whatever i bought the kart thingy so i could look cooler but thats 2 dollas the helicopter is like 15 but again thats only 2 dumb helicopters some servers have ways to bypass their dumb dlc things

arma iii is a so vast game that 100 pages would not be enough to describe it properly suffice to say this then arma iii is not a military simulator arma iii is the military simulator of course there are still many small glitches and bugs that need to be fixed but overall we are faced with a product extremely better than arma ii and any other military game ever released in a word masterpiece

highly addictive with lots of content worth every penny

this game is the ing best so get it peeps

arma 3 is an improvement over the previous generations but the game still suffers from a clunky interface and lackluster ai for an arma fan like myself though it is the best arma so far

simply the best game ever with all the mods and expansions i dont see how wanting any other game is possible i wish i would have bought this before buying dayz to save myself the money
recommended
get the hang of this game and youll have the time of your life if your into the military sim genre
recommended
this is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters you might not want to buy this as your first fps game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls but after some time it becomes a lot of fun i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another fps it has many cool features that you just cant get from other games like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends there is even gamemodes for roleplay like altis life and arma 3 life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people i think the possibilities in this game are endless you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate etc i have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun 1010

just an all around great game

this game is the definition of greatness the graphics and physics of the game are amazing though the game is not easy to get used to this game is a must play for anyone that like brutal unforgiving combat and realistic gameplay
recommended
this game is possibly one of the most realistic military shooters on the store at the moment this game has all types of mods that can be installed but just the gametypes you can play from the stock game are truly amazing there are role play servers team deathmatches deathmatches zombies survival games ect the only issue with this game is the occasional animation glitch overall beautiful realistic looking game and a true must have for your steam library
recommended
this game is great but i expect more thoe but anyways its a great game i havent tried the other mods yet and this game is still greate so this game has a lot of content but not as arma 2 combined with the dlcs and oa also its sad that it the dlcs are a bit overpriced for the content it offers also one of the things i dont like about arma 3 is that they didnt use real names of weapons and vehicles even has fake guns like the mx rifles considering this to be a military sim i expect real weapons and vehicles
recommended
great setup just wish it was a bit more realistic in the avatars movements etc other than that pretty great game
recommended
i mean its ok

when i screamed i play cod a lot of kids ran to me  but  when i scream i play arma 3 i get all the es

arma has always been in my mind after i bought arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead theres a lot of features u cant get in other games than arma 3 so 910 would put my money in to this
recommended
i bought it expecting my pc to handle it it couldnt take 41 hours of island life so i went back to arma 2 for now real review make sure your computer is good and no the one recommended to you by the best buy geek squad for 4000 dollars wont cut it just build your own like me but make sure your price range is over 700 dollars gl
recommended
game is all well and good but i really hate the fact that they put the game this far in the future the weapons are absolute crap im shocked that they didnt just say to hell with it and give you ing lazer guns i love the addition of scuba options and implementing body armor and customizing your own outfit and the campaign is interesting plus voice acting is much better than arma 2 id give this a 6 out of 10 because i am not happy that i am gonna have to download a  load of mods to play the game with equipment and vehicles that should of been implemented in the first place
recommended
cant say enough good about this game so much more fun than the run and gun games i enjoy making missions and playing them with my friends the mod community has to be one of the best ever other than some bugs here and there which i know the game is constantly being improved upon makes it one of my favorites if you are tired of the generic run and gun shooters and want a game that actually makes you have to think  ammo count health team members this is the one i got tired of the others wont mention their names  they kept tweeking them and wrecked the games for me so you could say i got tweeked right out of them i am a little over a half century old and have been gaming for many many years the operation flash point days were a blast and to see this evolve into what it is today is just great if i could add anything to this game it would be the ability to jump and maybe a flame thrower tank and the ability to put c4 on a small drone  i recommend this game for fun
recommended
this game is really fun on all the game modes but the best one that i have played by far is the epoch mod 
recommended
this game is one of the best military shooters it requires a clear head and patience 1010
recommended
this is a fantastic combat sim that has as much or as little depth and complexity as you would like its a shooter for grownups going back to cod et al will seem like a big step down to an arcade shooter the learning curve is fairly steep with all sorts of key bindings and responsibilities but boy is it satifying when you actually achieve something great game
recommended

recommended
arma 3 is basically gta 5 with a military mod 1110 for the gta 5ness
recommended
well this game took over my life no ragrets 1010
recommended
this game rocks

this is my most favourite game to date  i love it   the new dlc is great in particular the new opfor heli but it seems a little expensive  what i really would like to see is a return to the the old days with maps like fallujah and takistan etc and the more familiar vehicles such as abrams humvees and british challenger and jackals included rather than be downloadable as a mod  the altis and stratis maps look super but they look more like a holiday resort as opposed to a war zone and they lack the atmosphere of the a2 maps  i would glady pay for a more for an old style map im sure im not alone with thoughts on the direction arma is going  with altis life and such almost more popular than arma military sim they are more suited to the a3 maps and there popularity is understandable lets get back to war

the arma series has always been the best military simulator to date with the most realism ive seen with arma 3 they have out done themselves again the game is so well optimized that it barely puts any stress on my system and the graphic quality and sound realism is unparalleled you can play for hours in singleplayer then jump onto multiplayer with your friends cooperatively work through a mission or against each other as enemies with the steam workshop so tightly knit into the game itself you can download other player created missions be it single or multiplayer there is no end of fun to this game
recommended
great game for anybody that likes simulation type gameplay
recommended
its a decent game however not worth the $60 way too expensive arma 2 is the exact same game basically and cheaper
recommended
whats not to like about a true military tachtical first person shooter arma 3 delivers a excellent game that does just that this is not your typical run around killing spree like most fps games lead people to beleive with its extensive maps arma 3 gives gamers a vast variety of landscapes dynamic scenery including day to night trasistions in arma 3 you need to slow it down and take your time or your self dead with no chance to respawn no respawn thats right realism is a real as it gets but dont worry respawns can and do exist but sometimes its better to wait for a medic if one is available trust me when i tell you that arma 3 is as real as it can get
recommended
better then csgo

best reality game

great game for some tactical gaming
recommended
great setup just wish it was a bit more realistic in the avatars movements etc other than that pretty great game
recommended
arma 3 is my favorite game of all time out of the box arma offers an immersive deep and tense military simulation experience that cant compare to any other videogame the feeling of being under fire with your lifethatsworth 2hours is so immersive that i often scream of fear and fun but to only play the base game is not understanding arma arma is a platform for content there are literally hundres of mods for arma 3 most of those mods are of topnotch quality do you want to play on a tropical island during world war 2 naval warfare transform arma into a flight sim you name it it can be done thanks to the amazing game structure bohemia interactive provides that said arma is not for everyone but everyone i have recommended it and with whom ive played it about 5 people now loves it to death literally on top of all arma looks the best of almost all pc games not because of all the pretty bumpmaps and lighting effects but because of the scope  one moment you are underwater in a submarine while on the other you may be riding in a tank and firing on detailed bases and enemies while using thermal vision or pictureinpicture you do need a 1000dollar rig to even attempt to play this game but then again this game is not for everyone if youve ever wanted to go to war without risking your life or destroying other peoples go buy this game now
recommended
the mods make this game more amazing
recommended
if i got stuck with one game only in my library it is this the possibilities it offers and the community that support it make it a winner that said it has its issues needs a strong cpu and decent to perform very well going against the rule of thumb in modern pc gaming additonally there are lots of bugs and issues that still need address unfortunately a lot of them have existed in previous titles too there is positive development progress all the time though arma 3 aims for and achieves something which no other game does
recommended
great game  its a must buy for everyone who has some time on their hands 
recommended
this is one game franchise ive stuck with since the start back in the ofp days the game has always deliverd with the best game playsimulation of any other like it arma is worth its full price sure it has some bugs but the amount of fun this game can bring is well worth a few problems
recommended
this might seem incredibaly dull and difficult but after the frst time you and group of friends get pinned down in a village while in convoy and your friend expertly lands a hummingbird right in the street and you all pile in while round whizz past your heads and you soar into the air to safety its almost indescribable especially since the whole thing is unscripted it can be one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming but its what you make of it dont be expect to hop in and instantly enjoy yourself the game only gives you the tools and you make what you want with said tools
recommended
ooh you get dlcs coming nice ooh i have to pay for those  what over 10euros for ing content that should have been in the ing game from the start aah you got expansion coming nice how much do we have to pay for that let me guess if you own arma2 and arrowhead you will get some % off no cause  you we dont give a flying  if you played arma2 and pre ordered arma3 we are here to make money and  the customers still recommend this game if you like arma at all good work bohemia you have become full bs  you httpiytimgcomvi9jpk0_odrhahqdefaultjpg
recommended
this game has been great all the way through you start the multiplayer completely lost in the number of controls people running in the base and the helicopters flying overhead it is a good thing the community if very understanding of this and helps new players get oriented all the time playing singleplayer is fun but the real stuff is in the multiplayer once you get tired of the vanilla game then go and try some mods play with six is a mod manager that works great for it most of the mods i have run into are highly detailed and work amazingly it adds a completly new side to the game as it gives the option for players to get new gear new weapons new vehicles new maps and even new missions all of which can be used on certain multiplayer servers 1010 you will get your moneys worth cons  hackers decent server admins deal with them often enough  some tkers here and there but the majority of the community is good  game bugs and servers go down i feel it just acts as a signal i should finally take a break  you cannot play for just an hour you will play for hours on end not something you can just pick up
recommended
this game is extremely wellmade
recommended
arma 3 is a great continuation on the arma series arma 3 combinds all of the features of its predecessor and adds various ui improvements such as being able to add and remove attatchments to your weapon and adding the ability to change various parts of your clothing overall it is well worth the money ive put in well over 1000 hours and still have the desire to play it pros large worldspace  modability gives 1000s of hours of content  a complex mission editor  realistic combat cons cpu & gpu intensive  ai can become predictable at times
recommended
really fun fps enjoy it much more than arma 2 the dayz mod here isnt that great but you gotta make do with what you got
recommended
love the game but it could be better mechanics are flawed sometimes which can lead to frustration but otherwise a great game
recommended
takes some time to learn the controls but once you learn them youre good to go this game has amazing graphics the physics are great what else could you ask for this game has its challenging times that make it so much better than most fps games the world that you play in is huuuge
recommended
well arma 3 is a great game really realistic but after you play 400 hrs it gets really boring still would get it great game great graphics 
recommended
love this game
recommended
when i play i play for a long time because their is a lot of actions and i meet different people and derp around and set mines under our feet and go wtf i will play tomorrow
recommended
in arma 12 you can crawl walk run and now in arma 3 you can swim yet you still cant ing jump 810 would be 1010 if you could jump
recommended
dont expect much from the campaign but wow if you have a good pc the multiplayer and mods like arma 2 did will quite possibly change the way you look at video games
recommended
amazing graphics are very realistic the game play itself will be hard to grasp at first however after you have gotten the hang of it it can indeed be very rewarding as well as realistic overall in general i would recommend arma to anyone who wants a true sandbox playground to engage in different military situations and other community made missions
recommended
this game is as good as my dad10144a i love it in the butt yyyyyyaaaaaasssssssss
recommended
the battle royale mod is one of the reason it makes it great
recommended
best reality game
recommended
love this game so many different things you are able to choose from if you havent tried it you are sadly missing out
recommended
i played like 450h arma then i thought about scripting and that is the moment when arma becomes a tool not a game just awesome everything you can imagine is possible
recommended
breaking point make this game 1010
recommended
have you ever felt like running 4km with 40kg of gear only to get shot from 1km away have you ever felt like balancing 24 different factors before firing a single shot in an fps have you ever felt like knifing noobs just doesnt cut it anymore pun intended if you answered yes to any of these questions you may need treatment in the form of arma 3 an openworld simulation fps arma 3 short for arma 3 is the crux of over a decade of refinement by one of the most dedicated development teams out there  and it shows visually it is stunning of course depending on specs aurally it is surreal and when it comes to rping and simulation there is no better option except maybe vbs made by the same people but that costs $$$$$ and is used by actual armies so yeah maybe not need more incentive as well as a dev team that updates news for the fan base weekly and is still improving the game and plans to continue doing so there is also the modding commmunity for arma  which is second to none arma 3 can literally be anything you want it to be  even a taco 1110 would die 12008 times again
recommended
operation flashpoint with better graphics and the same ai xd unfortunately the only ground war simulator who exist buy it there is no alternative if you search for a good war game
recommended
1010 hands down my favorite game right now the mods are just amazing
recommended
really good game to be honest if your an army fan boy its for you if you like fps games its also for you runs well on even budget systems and if you have any crash problems there is plenty of information online the singleplayer is ok but im for the multiplayer
recommended
this game is the best military simulator ive ever played
recommended
arma iii is an amazing game by itself but when you start trying out some of the community mods that is when you really see its potential mods like altis life king of the hill epoch overpoch and so many more turn this one game into an entire game bundle w plenty of different game styles i have been in the arma community for years and have contributed whenever i can i love the game love the community & love the new cq mod for arma 3 set to release very soon my opinion on the cq mod may be a bit biast considering im on the dev team but i still know a good mod when i see one check it out for yourself cq mod gameplay video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3weuajuuqdy cq mod armory selection system httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmu1ksajhaim

amazing game better with friends even though bohemia has made the game unfinished so modders can expand on i its still the best game possable without mods that is the closest ive ever been to being back in a warzone a exmilitary friend 1110 would arma again ive already got 380 hours on this too
recommended
best game ive ever played
recommended
scares the crap out of me when im being shot at
recommended
amazing game endless game modes with mods and diff types of game play a must have for fps lovers and with the epoch mod thousands of hours of fun are to be had
recommended
an amazing game full of content and fun one of the best things to do is to download mods and mess around with frriends
recommended
this game has ups and downs the up is that arma has a huge modding database com is that you need a good peice of hardware to run it overall i recommend this game just for its realism and simulation
recommended
dont ask any thing  just buy it
recommended
this is the best game ever i did everthing that you can possiably imagine in arma 3
recommended
great military simulator even better with mods that improve immersion
recommended
one of my favorite games there is soo much different game modes and mods to play 1010 rinofocus
recommended
if you are looking for something to do if you are bored if you like some resistance if you really like teamwork if you dont like teamwork but can be around people this is the ultimate game you will always have something new to learn fix repair or just curse with this game in game you can create what the duck you what trying to install mods it takes time and is super complicated and rarely every functions properly but in the end its worth it i have yet to see a more complicated but fun game to play with people even if you are a lone wolf and just wants to sit on a hill and shoot people while your friends are running rambo in a town just saying 2000 hours in a2 1000 hours in a3 and i never feel like giving up on arma i would marry this game because i would have the same complicated arguments with a wife as with this game 12119 points
recommended
awsome i been playing on the free weekends its come out i dont see anty thing wrong with it
recommended
this game is the best arma game in the entire series it is truly an amazing game the graphics are suprisingly good and the gameplay is very fun especially if you like realisic war games that takes teamwork and strategy to stay alive but i would not recomend this game to the daily call of duty fan boy guy this game is slow paced and takes lots of strategy and teamwork unlike call of dutys run and gun and lone wolf type of game if you are familiar with arma 2 this is everything you love with better graphics and physics for example arma 2 you shoot a man he stands there for a sec then falls down and dies with no blood affect arma 3 you shoot a man he realistically falls some what rag doll physics and there is a realistic blood affect overall i think the game is great and i give it a 1010

it was just a normal day in invasion and annex a coop gamemode entirely community made that teams up the whole playerbase against ai usually 50 as the player cap i had taken explosive specialist and i was waiting at base to get teamed up with a squad and holy i couldnt of gotten a better one first delpoyment was a cakewalk so we decided to just get dropped off near the objective without ressuplying at base we will take an airdrop they said so we halfresupplyed along the way the next thing we know we have been pinned down and holding our ground by literally all of the enemy forces in the point since the other squad wasnt doing a good enough job our medic got killed by a granade launcher we ran out of first aid kits so we threw some smoke and dragged the wounded away while me and our machinegunner covered it was chaos we held for about 20 minutes until ing base finally decided to send in medical evac but not even that instead of a chopper to get us out of that ing place they sent another medic at that point i had ran out of ammo and was borrowing he granades from the squad leader to use as mortars for targets that were 500 meters away somehow we managed to push into the village kill everything and evac i dont think a game has made me consistently feel knees deep in  for 2 hours or so if you like to get shot down from the sky by aa guns and having really ing cool scenarios get this game right now tldr enjoy being pinned down by troops for hours while you have no supplies and your allies back at base are circle jerking buy it
recommended
one of the best milsim games out there you like shooting flying driving blowing stuff up or just taking in the scenery this game is sure to suprise plus there are several great mods and missions to explore
recommended
the best war simulation game out there you can do pretty much anything the numerous mods and user created contect only make the game even better

in altis life we found a cop repairing his vehicle me and my friends with ghillie suits got out of our stuck and told him to put his hands down my friend hand cuffed him and stole his kidney we lock picked his police truck and took the keys my friend shoved him inside the car and we decided to try get him into the city to show off to everyone that we managed to capture a cop on our way there my friend crashed the car into the wall going 100 kmh and the car exploded and killed us all 1110 ign would bang again
recommended
i wanted to rewrite my review since my prior review didnt give this game justice and honestly makes made me look 8 when i wrote it first off this game is amazing in the right mind set you need to enjoy running 3 km and then dying to someone 1km away its can be a pain but its fun if you now how to play i love the aspect that you can create and play your own missions and i think this really can bring a community together one of the biggest aspects that make this game as big as it is modding dayz was the biggest breakthrough in modding for arma 2 and it created a whole new chapter in arma and what it would become there is so many mods you can play such as a3l dayz wasteland dom battle royale and those are just a few mods that the community could create my pros and cons pros great community modding singleplayer coop missions weekly updates good dlc cons terrible fps anti cheat is flawed servers tend to not show up joining on friends is a pain things id like to see id like to see a coop aspect added to singleplayer playing alone is kinda boring at times ability to turn off fatigue in single player the ais tend to get ahead since fatigue can really mess your player up fixing fps this has been a recurring issue in arma games the fps is terrible you can check my specs its not my computer i hope this gets fixed soon but i dont have much hope
recommended
its a really good military sim it kinda better then arma 2 but still have a little bit of bugs but beisde that this game suck just kidding arma 3 is where it is at best military sim out there keep up the good work bohemia interactive i love you for making arma when i first saw arma in a gaming magzaine i always wonder would i ever play this game got a pc played arma 2 free version boom fell in love with it three days later brought arma 2 and arma oa loved both of it the mods the game the capaign and etc one i heard arma 3 came out it felt like i was having an  i was excited thank you again bohemia interactive for making an awsome game like arma i really hope great things will come out from this game in the furture 
recommended

recommended

recommended
fantastic game from casual to hardcore sim this game can and will fit your needs in a game only thing i dislike about the game is the price of the dlc
recommended
this game will take you life but it is worth every week you put into it
recommended
best game i ever bought 1010 love it

recommended
possibly the greatest game ever made
recommended
it gave me countless hours of entertainment
recommended
this game will test your computers cpu but feels like a good game until i get off it then i noticei havent done anything in the game lol
recommended
one of the best tactical shooters ive played since arma ii 
recommended
ill go ahead and say that ive played this since the alpha stage of the game and i have to say that arma iii has come a long way since then arma iii is a great way for you to explore a more detailed tactical shooter this is more than shooter with pretty maps and sights this is more than just a shoot em up and knock em down kind of game this is a simulation a simulation of what armed combat can look like in reality unlike the movies and shows you are down there boots on the ground standing shoulder to shoulder with your squadmates and fighting to either seize a town or fighting for your life when youre the only one left the sounds are down right amazing and the detail on the rifles are wonderful when you are with friends and fighting alongside others communication is key to succeeding and achieving victory communicate with the people driving the tanks or any armored vehicle and combine arms to tackle enemy armor and air units as well as communicating with the ones flying attack helos and jets combine all of those elements and youve got yourself an unforgetable experience of awesomeness and all of this gets better if you find yourself a milsim unit you can specailize yourself in any mos military ocupational specialty from rifleman to at specialist helicopter andor fighter pilot you can learn all of this in this game of course threre are mods which alters the realism of this game to a more hardcore level which i highly recommend you doing ladies and gentlemen if you are looking for a detailed milsim tactical shooter then arma iii is for you remember communication is the key to success good luck fellow virtual soldier
recommended
i have played 24 hours in the past two days that means that half my time spent awake has been playing this game what does that tell you about how good it is play it now
recommended
best milsim on the market
recommended
an in depth difficult to learn but very fun warfare simulator plenty of gamemodes to keep you occupied and has an amazing supportive community with plenty of user made content waiting at your finger tips single player missions are very difficult but the satisfaction of finally finishing a mission keep you entertained and wanting more 910 highly recommended for anyone who enjoys shooters but wants a more realistic and challenging version of your average tactical shooter
recommended
its ok
recommended
an amazing fps action multiplayer game with sick graphics arma 3 a game like no other buy the game and experience ground combat air combat artillery and so much more it also comes in with a group of gamemodes like wasteland epoch mod overpoch mod altis life arma 3 life etc buy this game you wont regret it
recommended
its great its like sex except im having it
recommended
review arma 3 this is an honest review pros super detailed  realistic military strategies  singleplayer and multiplayer  so many weapons and vehicles  you will never run out of things to do if you so desired you could dress up as a civilian and go to the beach with your friends  vehicles and air vehicles handle ok cons the engine is very poorly optimized getting a good fps is tough in this game  most servers arent the best  can be very confusing for new players as there are many keys you need to know  the community isnt the greatest  the players can take the game very seriously if you mess up or fool around you could get banned my rating 7510 do i recommend it yes
recommended
loveing it with 800 hours on it mre content please
recommended
the closest you can get to a battlefield without putting yourself in danger
recommended
this game is great unlike most modern shooters arma 3s engine and combat mechanics are complete poop this leaves the most strategic player the victor instead of the player with the best twitch reflex rewarding strategy over reflex in a fps is refreshing
recommended
you can shoot snakes
recommended
a must have game if you have the pc to run it
recommended
this review was immediately after finishing the game over mission the last mission of the offical campaign 30 hours of a campaign just for me until i finished and something that long of dying many times and having to recreate my own plan or try new things to win was proper and worth it this was the most dynamic fps game ive played for now you could command your own squad pilot uav vehicles pilot vehicles & customize weapons rather poorly in campaign of course storyline showed much and that was good it was quick and started getting into the combat and ideal of what was happening every time you started a mission a quote was shown from history of the real world they were good meaningful quotes the gameplay is nice however its a fps just average killing it lets you go third person but you always need to look down the middle of the gun into the scope just to get something properly when your flying a heli or plane its hard at first so a bit of practice will help depending on land vehicles being a tank or vehicle that has a gun is just easy if you can get in a vehicle period just run the enemy over its funny and sad to see the ai even the at which have rocket launchers get run over even when theyre supposed to shoot at you they dont even run away from you they just stand there accepting it welcome to war no reason to bother about graphics it looks good besides its a 1fps the more 2fps you have the better 3fps you can play  1  first person shooter 2  frames per second 3  first person shooter cause fps has meanings right skipping that anyway i would recommend this however like all games its going to get boring and there will be no reason to play it other than making your own missions
recommended
great military sim that being said way too many people under 18 which really hurts the maturity level of the game lots of stupid stuff to deal with in player vs player ovearll i would recommend to anyone looking for a realism many other fps cant give you
recommended
i have never before felt so engaged in combat best fps out there the only problem is dlc you need them and they like to milk you do not expect to just buy 1 without dlc milking i would honestly give 1010 as of now its 810 i pray arma 4 wont be having dlc issues cod is for kids bf is for teens arma is for adults
recommended
rip fps 1010 would rage over low fps again
recommended
this is the best armystratgywar game you will ever find trust me you need to get this
recommended
by far the best sandbox shooter to ever come out the game is enriching and engaging there is no shortage of mods and the game keeps getting better by cnostant developer updates and the community contributions everyone in their right mind who claims to be a pc gamer should play this game
recommended
better than battlefield better than call of duty
recommended
its da bombis good
recommended
super fun game with friends and still a really fun game without them good graphics realistic sounds all and all just one hell of an amazing game would recommend to anyone that can run it
recommended
too many controls for me good simulation though
recommended
this is one of the best war simulator in the world
recommended
where is my deluxe edition extra content that i paid for
recommended
a fantastic game easy to get into difficult to master best tactical combat game out there bar none
recommended
this game is probably one of the best simulation shooter out there team work is key and just playing this game is gonna be a one to master if you like the most realistic tatical shooter than this is the game to get and play its not battlefield 4 but hell it has many steam work shop items to simulate real events like the osama binladen simulation that you can play amongts with other people just a great game overall definently pick a copy up when its $30 or lower for sure
recommended
great game great mods great community this game has so many possibilities i couldnt even give you an estimated guess the pseudorealism in this game is absolutely fantastic and can make for some pretty clever shenanigans when put to the test with modern graphics gameplay mechanics and a hearty helping of good although somewhat overpriced dlc it definitely has a top spot contender in my book in single player the campaign missions are beautifully paced something which we rarely see in this genre while playing them i felt very engaged and felt a very present sense of urgency this sense of urgency really helps to propel the first chapter because you feel as if the world around you is slipping away right as you and your comrades fight to take it back on top of that there are some very interesting mechanics and side missions you can do during the campaign one of which will let you do a sort of freeroam mode where you can complete various usergenerated missions these missions will pop up out of nowhere as you are running along on your atv deep into enemy territory as you suddenly come upon a military checkpoint with heavy armaments you can either choose to systematically take the sentries and those pesky lmg carrying grunts or you can choose to rush right in and take it for mother russia but you could also just run around it seeing as how you have an atv but alas how much fun would that be this game has some of the best gamemodes and usercreated mods that i have ever had the pleasure of playing and competing in with such smashhit game modes as wasteland king of the hill just to name a few and my personal favorite breaking point the fun almost never stops however i did definitely have the most fun on breaking point a dayz esque master piece with a beautiful blend of pvp and pve battling zombies is not as cumbersome as they may be to a lowgear player in dayz and i think it for the better when you have low level gear they are just something to avoid as you survey the outskirts of town on the large 300km map altis or the many other maps that the mod offers while playing with a group on this mod as well as other gamemodes i have had some of the best online gaming experiences i have ever had and thats hard to beat allinall i think that this is a musthave for anybody who loves to play with a group of friends on a saturday night and have fun killing a bunch of noobs militarystyle
recommended
okay so this is my first review i have played the game for a while now and i really do enjoy playing i came in not having really any simulation experience and this game well it got me hooked this game can cater for everyones needs it hosts a variety of mods to enjoy and much more i started out buying the game downloading and got straight into the action i played invade and annex a mission where you have to complete tasks with a squad you get assigned to everyone is normally very friendly and i admitted straight away im new and got help by a very friendly group of guys and they truly did help next i played something that was blowing up at the time altis life i had one friend and at the end of 2 or so nights i left the server with an extra 4 friends who i still am in touch with arma 3 is a brilliant gamesim that truly does bring people together the game itself is breathtakingly stunning the graphics are incredible the physics are good and sometimes just funny the sounds are immersive and everything forms a package of awesomeness obviously like all games there is always going to be bugs but on this i havent run into many so from my pov arma 3 gets a solid 910 gg bohemia
recommended
as always this still is the best military simulator in the world arma keeps affascinating me for its realism i really suggest you to buy the game if youre a fan of war real war the maps are really detailed and the ai is really  actually too much but there are mods that can help you resolve that problem anyway if you buy this game play it with a clan arma 3 really makes you cooperate with other people in order to survive and complete your mission if youre a cod fan you rather change side or forget about arma they are completely different and arma itself is usually not liked by shoot and run fan boys however armas editor allows you to create your own missions in every detail actually its not too simple making them but with some commands and other stuff you can start making some nice missions and enjoy the game with your friends furthermore there are tons of forums and people that can help you improve your editing skills providing you with commands suggestions and scripts enjoy

arma 3 is a great millatry simulator it is very in depth and i had a lot of fun with this game one of the things that was a buying point for me was altis life it is a gamemode like cops and roobers where you can do anything from smugle drugs acrros the border to stealing cars or robbing the bank however the main point that i like the most is how you can acoplish your objective in your own way for the campaign and the multiplayer you want to go in head first guns balzing you can you want to go with a stealty helicpoter insercion and some sniper support you can this is hands down one of the best millitary simulators and i strongly recomend this game

very good good graphics and realistic butif you havent played any arma games yet then it might be hard to get used to the controls and gameplaygamemodes my rating 810
recommended
awsome i been playing on the free weekends its come out i dont see anty thing wrong with it
recommended
while it may lack a bit of polish overall arma 3 provides an entertaining combat sim
recommended
this game is the best arma game in the entire series it is truly an amazing game the graphics are suprisingly good and the gameplay is very fun especially if you like realisic war games that takes teamwork and strategy to stay alive but i would not recomend this game to the daily call of duty fan boy guy this game is slow paced and takes lots of strategy and teamwork unlike call of dutys run and gun and lone wolf type of game if you are familiar with arma 2 this is everything you love with better graphics and physics for example arma 2 you shoot a man he stands there for a sec then falls down and dies with no blood affect arma 3 you shoot a man he realistically falls some what rag doll physics and there is a realistic blood affect overall i think the game is great and i give it a 1010
recommended
its pretty neat stuff i find it to be a pretty big improvement from arma 2
recommended
one of my favorite games there is soo much different game modes and mods to play 1010 rinofocus
recommended
if you are looking for something to do if you are bored if you like some resistance if you really like teamwork if you dont like teamwork but can be around people this is the ultimate game you will always have something new to learn fix repair or just curse with this game in game you can create what the duck you what trying to install mods it takes time and is super complicated and rarely every functions properly but in the end its worth it i have yet to see a more complicated but fun game to play with people even if you are a lone wolf and just wants to sit on a hill and shoot people while your friends are running rambo in a town just saying 2000 hours in a2 1000 hours in a3 and i never feel like giving up on arma i would marry this game because i would have the same complicated arguments with a wife as with this game 12119 points

the worst scorewhoring respawning fpsgame ever which makes this the best tactical military sandbox on steam ever 1010
recommended
pros  this is by far my go to pc game of all time are you looking for a gaming experience like no other then go with arma ive been an arma veteran for awhile and dont regret any minute ive put into the game yes you do need a somewhat powerful pc to get the best arma experience but the community and the people that you will meet while playing the game are what makes it amazing check out the video i linked below with some wasteland gameplay with friends ive met through playing the game hope this helped httpsyoutubeezhjvrx7wx8 cons  controls are  and not as optimized as it could be
recommended
its like killing people but in a military sim way ive been here since the beginning supporting bi for so long and they have completely failed me with arma 3 just some questions for you guys why are the vehicle physics so awful why cant you move around inside large open vehicles why are the movements and animations so awful why can a player press v and step through walls why cant you jump and why does the step up function just move you straight through the object you want to step up onto why does a 1 meter fall kill people how hard is it to fix the simulation aspects of your game why do you think i would pay for a few extra gunsskinshelicopters if you havent even fixed the game breaking bugs yet why do modders spend more time working on your game than your studio
recommended
do you like explosions do you like open world games do you like games where you will spend your entire life playing do you like games with endless scenarios and gamemodes of what you can do then arma 3 is for you arma 3 is one of the best games i have played to date if you think of it you can do it in arma 3 do you want to roleplay build bases or just hangout with friends and explore atlis i would recommend arma 3 to anyone who has played the past arma games any fps game and any openworld game 1010
recommended
i get to play it for three minutes before it crashes 1010 ign
recommended
who dosent want to get this game flicking amazing out of the series so was arma 2 this is just big booty es mate recommanded 1010
recommended
this game is 1010 worth getting nothing will go to waste on this game if you get board of some of the game types you get mods to play never ends
recommended
this is a really good game but dont get me wrong when i say this but this game breaks quite a bit i dont really know if its just me but besides that the game is amazing so many things you can do in it 1010
recommended
great game love it
recommended
arma iii is a military sandbox game aiming towards realism and authenticity arma iii thrives in these aspects arma iii does however lack in official content it seems to me that your enjoyment is based on a few simple factors your ability to distinguish quality community made content you joining a quality community or playing with a couple of friends and finally your ability to work as a team with those friends to accomplish those missions the biggest standout missions are the official support modules and the cummunity made duws

have had a blast playing epoch breaking point and most recently wasteland 1000 hrs and still going cant get enough of it

great fun game

for a military gamesim this is looking second to none huge enviroment mixed with almost limitless posibilities from a modding point of view this game is insane not only does it have an intuitive editor but also a dedicated community providing a stream of free content which is now managed via the workshop part of steam a must have for any immersiverpg gamer next stop altis
recommended
dont bother playing in multipayer if you have bad internet connection 
recommended
arma 3 good but not best arma 2 best
recommended
although i like chernarus much more than altis and stratis the game itself is highly improved over arma 2 physics being the first thing but not limited to it movement is much more natural and so are voices would i recommend it yes but it lacks the love i used to feel for chernarus itself the landscapes and environment in general
recommended
nice graphicsgamea real simulator with a amazing multiplayer a sin to not have it amazing game
recommended
this game is the most amazing game i have ever played i do not usually post reviews and if i do they are usually for negative feedback but arma deserves any and all posative feed back
recommended
i wrote a review for this game quite a long time ago but by now that i think about it i like playing arma for none of the reasons that i had talked about previously i had talked about the mechanics that bohemia had put into the base game but ive now come to realize that arma has become one of those games that are instead defined by the people that play it and mod it you can take my word for it that arma is well worth your time if you get a group of talented playersscenario creators but if you need more proof then allow me to ramble on about a particularly rememberable instance that was thanks to the group i happened to have found if for nothing else but to write a love letter to people so gratious enough to let me tag along the scenario of the day was as follows me along with the rest of our group of about six were highered by the powers that be within nato and the us cus reasons i assume to go to some base on some island to find something dont worry we would know it when we see it they gave us an a10 and several helicoptors of sorts so it was expended to run into a lot of unfriendly locals we were also told not to take anything larger then 762 or homing so we ended up with a pilot on call a squad leader mg gunner a guy with a handy dandy target designator a medic and myself given that i often times opt to do medic duties i was lost for a role so i just picked up the highest caliber semiautomatic sniper i could find slapped a suppressor and scope on it and went with everyone else to the helicoptors the pilot checked the helicopter to make sure everything was fine while we sat in the back making jokes i went to chasington once someone yelled over the helicoptors rotors it was like this after an uneventful ride to the forested area we were to land we make our way up a small hillside to overlook the adjacent valley directly in front of us we find a small house surrounded by troops and an armored car they seem to outnumber us we each pick a target mine being a man barely visible behind a window the fight would begin on the sls word after a few seconds he stands up from our position and lets loose a grenade towards the truck followed in quick succession by my rifle shot and the mg to finish up the rest in a matter of a few noisy seconds and some well placed shots we clear the house then another group on the hillside opposite ours tears into us for tearing into their friends immediately we lose our designator along with the mg and myself taking a round while we all retreated to a rock for cover the sl gets on his radio to talk to our air while me and someone else fire back at the two guys shooting us we both drop them after a minute and our very frazzled selves make it to yet another hill that overlooks the base bringing the armored car with us i will say this about arma they manage to make some impressive views when it comes to scale when we crested the hill we could see for miles across a sparsely wooded valley with a town and military base at its end the base was our target and next to our target was a very scary and very operable selfpropelled gun guarded by some troops we all collectively  a brick foundation and the sl gets on his talkie to radio the a10 the pilot tells us hell be there in five minutes and to keep the tank lazered good thing we grabbed the designator off our dead guy to pass the time we muse about the tank how many people are in the valley and what the a10 run will look like i hobble over to the guy holding the designator and ask him for the range to the infantry i provides a number and i range the rifle the a10 begins to swoop in and we can barely hear it we can however see two bombs drop from its wings and impact the tank the plum of fire reaches forty meters in the sky we all cheer a bit and plan our next move off the hill and to the base the pilot tell us there are dozens of guys in the base so we decide to hang back for a bit hey can i take a shot at those guys by the tank i ask our sl go for it with immeasurable glee i grab up the new designator guy and make him my spotter he constantly gives me the distance to the group of guys running to the tank i take aim at the lead man and fire off a shot that explodes on the guys upper body sending him backwards as the designator makes a comment about the hit i take aim at the second guy and fire off three more shots one of them impacts the guy in the leg and he falls to the ground satisfied and with new orders to get in the truck i stop shooting unbeknownst to us there are atleast fifty people coming up the hill at us after that airstike in the interest of time lets just say that we got pretty shot up and retreated back a ways with three out of the original five that landed after quite some time we get some reinforcments and grab another much larger helicopter to take us right to the base apparently we were running out of options its me and the newly spawned designator dangling over the chinooks back ramp our sl and mg gunner on the two guns and our medic in the center halfway to the base our medic falls out of the helicopter and manages to safetly land somewhere with a parachute we have a laugh about it and start to fly over the base round start to ping off the sides of the heli as our pilot yells for the side gunners to shoot back the sparadic firing escalates to a full on machine gun barrage right up at us round start to ping around the rear ramp and into the cargo bay the guy next to me on the ramp takes several rounds and falls out of the back the pilot yells that we have a fuel leak and we rapidly descend towards the dirt we impact the ground and thankfully dont explode yet the pilot yells for everyone to get out we spread out and deal with the few stragglers that are still shooting at us we weight our options and decide to just walk into the base as carefully as possible we sneak into the base taking a round in our direction here or there after entering the main gate we are greeted by the rotting welcoming committee in the bases assembly area are about fifty dead bodies and some blown out vehicles thank god for air support we move up to the building and assemble at the front door someone inside fires a shot through the door and we rethink our decisions we decide to throw every grenade we have through the door to the hiding troops afterwards me and the pilot charge into the house and double tap the guys inside we then start to look around for whatever it is we were supposed to find they were right we would know it when we see it we grab as much of it as we can each hold and haul  out the way we came we leave in such a hurry no one notices that our mg gunner takes a shot and dies a little ways from the gate we regroup near some trees on our way to a car nearby we look back to see where our gunner is but a round hitting the tree by us convinces us to leave on the car anyways i jump into the driver seat with the pilot in the passenger spot and the sl riding in the back i haul  down the road to get away from the base after awhile we slow down have a laugh about everything and the pilot directs me back to base for continuitie sake the mission apparently ended as follows the people who hired us said they werent gonna pay us for finding their package but our sl threatned to tell on them about what was actually inside they shut up pay us and we go on our merry and bloodsoaked way a funny end to a great time of a scenario created by the pilot since then hes made and found a lot more sometimes in these scenarios im on a 50 cal covering a squad sometimes im defusing an ied in the middle of a crowded street as people watch me and sometimes im even leading a squad however thanks to the group i play this game with it is never dull

this game was terrible in arma 2 it hogged your computer it destroyed your computer if you had it on high all around the devs fixed that they added more content a brand new dlc pack coming out servers with variety of gameplay scenarios and ideas the editor is fun to mess around with the singleplayer is coming to a great story zeus is going to make the gameplay massively expanded think of everything peopel can do thats why this game is amazing
recommended
best military simulation ever made and probably will be for the next 1020 years if you have the slightest liking of any military branch you should totaly get this its worth it the controls may seem tricky at first very good to play with a team communication is key alot of things go boom so if you like boom then you should think about getting arma 3 910 there could be some less glitches with the mods like dropped items dissapearing and other minor things
recommended
brilliant tactical warfare simulation

a really interesting sandbox basically build a story on your own or play other playermade maps includes normal deathmatch coop story games and anything that can be made with your imaginationsrequires some level of programming though only for those who are willing to learn how to play and not just point and kill like counterstrike recommend to play as a group
recommended
awesome only if you play it with friends
recommended
this game is good i play it all day
recommended
coming from a very extensive flight sim background i generally expect too much from games these days having the whole planet at your fingertips flying from city to city country to country high fidelity aircraft systems correctly simulated it sure sets a high bar but arma 3 leaves no part of me unsatisfied the immersion factor is brilliant and playing with the right people very professional i definitely recommend
recommended
improved version of arma 2 but the map isnt quite as good imo
recommended
arma 3 should you get it that depends what is it a future war simulation game pros large maps large weapon selection fully upgradable weapons large vehicle selection large community large variety of gamemodes cons goes from very slowbased action to sudden moments of speed it can be disorientating you will die many many times you will rage many many times your game will bug out many times you will randomly disconnect from servers many times you will have noidea what youre doing many times you will accidentally crash your car and burn to death many many times you will spend 90% of your time customising your character only to die and have to repeat it
recommended
i likes that it was combat based and had all war vecles the only thing i dilikes was the lack of maps to play one but i know this takes a long time to build maps so i would still recemend this to my freinds as a good game otherwise this is the best well built war game ive ever played not laggy
recommended
love the game havent had as much fun playing a game as i have this one in a long time the multiplayer mod servers are where you will have the most fun at
recommended
i highly recommend anyone in love with the previous arma series games to get involved with arma3alpha and provide feedback to make this game as good as the previous series together we can make it awesome
recommended
arma 3 is a really great game i loved arma 2 and i love this game too its really awsome and fun to play the graphics just look amazing the gameplay mechanics are better then in arma 2  a lot better  i dont like the dlc thing that they are doing i mean arma 3 got so much less weapons and vehicles then arma 2  expansions and the idea of charging us 1020 for simple dlc like marksmen or helicopters that should be part of the main game  beacuse there aint much weapons in the game atleast compared to arma 2  i understand that you want to make money but atleast make the dlc 310 max its just not worth spending 13 on a simple dlc that adds few guns and a full ghillie or few new helicopters or if you are going to make expensive dlcs make them atleast bring much new content with them ratings  gameplay 910  graphics 1010  story 710  multiplayer  best part  9510  price 610  beacuse of the expensive dlc but if i had to rate the price of the game without the annoying dlc 810  my overall rating is 8510 why  the game is worth buying but as i said above it has expensive dlc with not much content in it and it makes it hard to play the game without it  mostly if you play mp you wont be able to acces the new weapons  vehicles and you are kinda in a disadvantage   sorry for my english its not perfect but im doing my best  
recommended
this game is pretty bad
recommended
simply put this game is like a hot women naked awesome add some nice sexy knickers mods and it gets even better
recommended
makes me feel insecure about my pc hardware 10
recommended
if you want a game game where teamwork is the only solution to any problem then look no further
recommended
this game is cool

arma 3s campaign is a big powerful deeply engrossing thing but there is one disappointment its lack of vehicular missions since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt there are no tank missions no helicopter missions and no jet missions i can understand why to a point armas vehicles especially its airborne offering take time and effort to learn to control moreover in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway on the other hand flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue and its frustrating that 13 years on armas campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience if you want to get familiar with armas military machinery youll need to look to the showcase missions download one of the many communitybuilt scenarios out there or jump into the enormous multiplayer there are a vast range of multiplayer game modes to take your fancy king of the hill challenges three teams of 16 players to wrest control of a particular objective using small arms tanks helicopters the works if youre of a more cooperative bent there are a range of developer missions that require teamwork to beat the odds including the enormous escape from altis mission which tasks your plucky group with safely reaching the coastline while avoiding the sights of a vastly superior enemy force yet the most interesting of armas multiplayer modes stem from the community wasteland is a survival mode in a similar vein to dayz but without the zombies and with considerably more military equipment altis life meanwhile eschews the focus on soldiers in favour of a copsandrobbers scenario where players tired of making money through picking fruit or mining ore club together to perform elaborate bank heists and playerpolice hunt them down a lengthy paid alpha followed by six months of staggered campaign releases has given arma 3s multiplayer an extraordinary range this is largely thanks to the fantastic foundation that is the island of altis which makes every mission every multiplayer match every combat engagement feel unique theres something about bohemias worldbuilding that inspires people importantly though arma 3s vanilla content now stands on equal footing with those thirdparty inspirations its still a little rough around the edges but its a darned impressive package nonetheless

arma 3 is the modern combat simulation of 20132014 actually that was a lie arma 3 is anything you want it to be a first person shooter a role playing game arma 3 fits all genres if you want something and have the means to make it you can all because of the new arma 3 engine personaly i think arma 3 knocks battlefield & call of duty off the board even if most people think the faces on arma 3 look like total crap compared to other shooters on the market graphics dont matter its the content of the game thats most important plus arma 3 is open world no scripts no dumb game barriers no seeing through walls crazy ais everyones game expirence is different depending on their actions i mean arma 3s maps like altis and stratis are just plain massive i 100% reccomend buying this game regardless of the type of computer you have well obviously you need to meet minimal requirements to even play the game also people who have intel hd graphics mobile you may face some difficulties get ready to see real warfare

one of the best games out if you ask me if you love military shooter games and love to actually play as team and not just play some type bf or call of duty where you just run around shoot  you will enjoy this game campiagn is a decent lenghtif you play on the hardest settings it will take you weeks lol but the mp is where the game shines i personallly play on coop servers that run invade and annex or patrol ops and its almost like playing a real wari highly recommend the 7thcavalry coop servers you do get the mp servers that run stupid  like wastelanddayz rip off but worse or atlis life sims ripoff but thats not what this game is about do you love the thrill of hearing the bullets fly past your head or want to pilot a transport helio or attack helio giving the ground forces some cover and take out the armor or maybe you want to jump in a tank to lighten up the enemies forces or a artillery vehicle and use the viop to have the forces closer to the fight mark or even use there laser guided scope to spot targets and light them up this game has finally fillled the hole in my heart for a real war shooter that i have been begging and praying for the last 20 years this is the closeest game you will get to the real thing i highly recommend getting this game

arma 3 is a great rpg & shooting game there is multiplayer like altis life and mods such as arma life there are great communities to join as well as new friends to meet highly recommend buying this game however you must have a good computer that is beyond the recommended requirements
recommended
well what i like about it is that it is a military simulator and that it has so many different game modes but what i really hate about it is that the price is to steep i would recommend lowering the price down to $30$40 or somewhere in between for about a week that would really boost sales and i know i will buy it

good game to meme with your friends if you want to have fun and meme play this game

this is the best fptacticals by far i dont think there is any real competition out there unlike most other fpss this gem of a game has longevity yes you have a campaign mode and other singleplayermultiplayer scenarios {made by an ever growing army of fans} which you can download from the arma iii workshop but you also get to create your own missions in the mission editorcreator i dont think there are manyif any other fpss that offer that much depth in their games

its a great game love the grathic details and also the game engine and i really am impressed with the items and guns that was put into the game it self

first off id like to say that i have invested over 500 hours into arma 3 it is easily my top favorite shooter  military simulator everaside from goldeneye 64 of course this game is realistic shooter where you have to adjust and zero your weapon to the distance your enemy is at the combat takes place up close and sometimes over 12 thousands meters lots of weapons a few different factions tanks night vision thermal long range combat bombs jets helicopters all the good stuff this game isnt a call of duty type game where you are locked in a small map or situation like a boat this game is played in the open world where you can go prone hide from enemies snipe them bomb them anything arma 3 is more of a game engine there are game types involved that have different gameplay mechanics some of these types are as follows but not limited to wasteland  wasteland is just how it sounds its an open world game where you spawn in with nothing but a pistol and must survive against 60 other players find guns stay alive by finding food and water make a cache of weapons team up and conquer the map if you die you respawn with nothing again very very fun king of the hill  koth is massive battle with 3 total factions trying to seige and capture one city anywhere between2040 players on each team fight for a town the faction that keeps more players alive in the town slowly wins tanks helicopters lots of weapons and jets can be purchased with money you accrue from killing other players combat sometimes occurs at 2000 meters between tanks across the landscape another very fun map there are many more types availible to play like altis life breaking point and day z mod too many others to name pros  game view distance is easily the furthest one can see in any game ever made butitll kill your computer lol  lots of cool stuff to use jets tanks helicopters weapons and vehicles  moddable lots of cool stuff to do  realistic bullets drop over distance zeroing of weapons realistic combat distances  big the maps are large and big enough to accomadate lots of people cons  bugs the game consists of various non game breaking bugs and such that never seem to get fixed  unoptimized the game is unoptimized period i run it at ultra with dual 980s and get 1535 fps in multiplayer games changing the graphics to a lower setting helps little it just runs slowthere is no question to it my youtube channel shows the game and a few of its mods check out my video on the wasteland mod httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbjoe9xzriig

bought this for battle royale 10010 people killed its the modern hunger games forbes prepare for the same  engine except this time it doesnt look blurry af ign this is better than dayz yet dayz has had more development time and money put in bob barker overall this should be rated 3 out of 4 armas maybe arma 4 will be more unoptimized but i still love it our games are  but youll still buy them with love dean hall buy this game its the most fun youll have in awhile
recommended
i have been playing arma 3 for quite a while now and thought i might share my thoughts on it for those planning to buy it arma 3 is a great game and with the massive amounts of community addons it never stops delivering something new if you want to run around and kill other players in a massive bloodbath you can do that on the king of the hillkoth mission if you want to run around and roleplay as a civilian in a deprived country you may do that also on altisstratis life and last but not least if you want to fight ai in a team of players you can do that also there are many missions for this gameplay what i am trying to say is that i have been playing this game for a long time 1700 hrs and i am not bored yet if i am not bored of this game yet then that is saying something the game is definetly worth buying and it will always be so in my eyes thank you to those great people that made this game d

this game is freking awesome
recommended
been playing this game for about 8 months now and thought id publish my review of this game when i first started to play the game i was new to arma so didnt know the controls it was quite tricky to figure out all the different controls but after a week or 2 i got to grips with most of it if you like real battles and the strategy of it then i would buy this game you will enjoy it very much the game is more in depth compared to other games like battlefield for example its more realistic which is why i started playing it the graphics in game look amazing and the way they made the maps are very good also so if you have a good graphics card you will see the benefit on high settings the best thing about the game is there is many different mods you can play which i never realised before but ive had so much fun playing different ones really you are buying this game but getting several of them for free as the mods are totally different to the others but still the same weapons and such but it feels different in how you play so buying it is very worth while its mainly all i play its that good
recommended
awsome what more is there to say
recommended
arma 3 supposedly my best game i have ever played many things to say but i want to make this a small and quick review i will first start off with the community bohemia interactive is depending on the community to make missions for the game and i feel that that is the way to go as they did this with many other games and turned out succesful the community lets out mods addons and such for the game from singleplayer to coop missions for your friends and multiplayer missions such as invade and annex addons to the game like weapons such as m4s g3s scar weapons and much more because in the vanilla game there is not much of a diverse amount of weapons in the game as there is and assault rifle and a carbine version of the weapon i am glad to see that the community members actually take their time to make amazing weapons that can not only be used in singleplayer but also multiplayer if it is allowed ballistics oh dear god if i talk about this subject you would think twice about hiding in cover and picking the best looking vest like the strap one for example the larger the caliber the bigger the penetration hiding behind a wall may make you unsafe to the 762mm round for exaple if you were to be shot with 556mm round then it wouldnt hurt as much i am not an ammuntion genuis this is from my own experience vests have a big role in arma 3 as they may mean life or death to you picking a lightweight vest may make you a quick target but very vulnrable to bullets but if you were to choose a plate carrier over a strap vest for exapmle you may be a slower targer but not by much adding to that that bullets wont penetrate the plate carriers very easily in my personal opinion pick the plate carrier vests as they make you a hard to kill target weapons weapons functionality and reliabilty in combat depends on the ammunition 556 65 762 9mm are just some of the ammunition the most effective sort of ammunition would be the 762mm as it is used currently in alot of modern weapons today and would be the most destructive and effective out of all ammo in arma 3 the 556 and the 65 would be mostly used on assault rifles and be effective at close to medium range meduim range would be 300m pistols and smgs would use the 9mm 9mm ammunition would be a larger sort of ammo but not as destructive or damaging as the greater 762 ammo better of using the greater assault rifles veichles land sea or air they all exist armed helicopters jeeps armored boats and more some mounted weapons on veichles could be a hmg or a grenade launcher each of the factions have speacial veichles nato uses the hunter which is an mrap it comes with mounted weapons and is mainly used for recconissance aswell it is a mine resistant veichle which not many of you know csat use the ifrit which is the same sort of reconnisance veichle as the hunter which is also mine resistant aaf use the strider not many of the player know this but this car is amphibious helicopters come in 3 categories i put in my mind light meduim and heavy light helicopters would the the hummingbird or littlebird and they come in unarmed and armed variants meduim helicopters would be a hellcat which is an armed transport heli aswell as an orca heavy helicopters would be the mowhawk each of the weights affects the manuverability of them boats boats main and sole purpose is reconissance of the sea your main job is to provide support from the sea and scout for enemy activity along the coasts there are not only military boats but aswell as recretion boats some boats come with a light machine gun some of them come with a grenade launcher some come with both some can come with none

the graphical beauty of this game is incredible and the game is among the most realistic combat games out there however dont be mistaken this is by no means in the same catagory as other gun games out there this does not play like an fps at all which in many cases i like my only complaint with the series is how rough the game is with almost everything you do not going to rant on about it but anyone who plays this cant deny that nothing you do flows very well getting in a vehicle or doing something like hopping over a fence isnt quick and smooth it almost feels like it stops the gameplay or combat gets in the vehicle then it resumes hard to explain this given that makes it just sound like every other game but trust me when i say it isnt the same now to make up for that complaint the game is fantastic you really do feel like a soldier and the range of gamemodes youll find on servers etc is endless finally to wrap it up they give you two massive maps that allow for very fun fights
recommended
unparalleled realism amazing graphics and sound that take advantage of higher end machines gameplay so intricate and suspenseful  the only true war simulator the modding community shines with great missions from specifc pve sets to pvp battles to full on rpgs it might not be the most fastpaced shooter  but when a well cooridinated assault kicks in the fireworks can make the most overthetop blockbuster shooter sequences look like cartoons the suspense of being killed with one shot of not knowing whether or not youve been spottted or trying to overwhlem an attacking or defending force provides tangible investment in your gameplay the realism of the weapons vehicles and physics simply has no competition if you want real and not arcade this is the ticket this game thrives when playing with other communicating humans and therein provides a war game experience that is addictingly engaging and entirely unique to arma

arma iii is quite different from most other first person shooters as to be expected since it is a military simulator with its clunky ui desync problems unexplained gameplay complicated controls and many other bugs it is clearly not perfect however when you get past the ui and have played the game long enough to understand how it works arma iii offers some of the best experiences in video gaming theres nothing quite like a 100 vs 100 match that turns the colossal altis map or the still giant stratis map into a war torn battlefield the true heart to this game is the mods and boy are there a lot of them to start i would suggest checking out altis life battle royale and wasteland these mods add so much life to the game many of these mods feel like complete individual games themselves in short though there may be some bugs and a steep learning curve there is no doubt that arma iii offers arguably the best multiplayer experience in video gaming  910 would glitch again
recommended
love this game and all of the gamemodesmods if you dont own it buy it now your missing out
recommended
well after more than 450 hours on record i have to say it is the best game in the last years there is so much to do with it seemingly unlimited ways to modify the game or to make own missions with nearly unlimited access to everything you need it deserves just one word awesome
recommended
great game if your into the arma series or simulation buy this
recommended
awesome game there is so much you can do here everything from sandbox to tactical realism both the multiplayer and singleplayer areas have huge playability levels plus new content is being added weekly so you never get bored awesome game one of my all time favorites highly recommend
recommended
arma 3 is a must have for any shooter fan that enjoys openended possibilities with several mods now available hence the reason im changing my review there are just so many things that you can do its not even funny coop missions are fun getting with a larger group and doing an mcc or zeus mission is just ridiculously fun and the campaign is still solid if you prefer pvp there are a lot more modes out now than when i originally wrote the review king of the hill is the only one ive really played and its not really my jam but hey if it is yours then go for it the game is fairly well optimized at this point but really poorly optimized mp servers are extremely noticable and when bad scripting is done its even more noticable this game on an ssd is a pretty intelligent decision with or without mods there is just a ton that you can do with this game if youre at all into large scale operations or even longlasting missions on a smaller scale you need this game point blank
recommended
i shot a guy in the head with a 30mm cannon at point blanc and he didnt die 1010
recommended
i m going to be honest it isnt such good as arma 2 despite better optimizationgraphic and zeus  zeus is really good but its hard to use unofficial addons to run zeus correctly is more drawbacks what i have to say it wasnt fell like arma anymore but like cod or bf unreal weaponsammo units vehicles body armor system  the biggest problem at all in my opinion  it was probably mented like good think but if you shoot soldier twice in chest he cannot be able to return fire ok he may survive but that should be all positive think is free bootcamp  but it doesnt fully support addons what is sad virtual arsenal loadouts re not able ti share in zeus when i said is positive it was because its free what is not common in nowadays but you can as normal add addons and mods in arma what makes it playable again in result  arma 3 is worth to buy for common player only because zeus nothing more have any value if you re arma enthusiast like me and you are going to play arma 3 with mods and addons its good improvement after arma 2 more support more mod and addon makers bigger maps
recommended
for an alpha there are so many aspects of this game that are already better than arma 2 a purchase now equals less to pay for when the full title releases
recommended
one of the best military games available its sandbox style and moddingcustomizations allow it to become almost anything you want cooperative military simulator roleplaying game survival horror you name it it offers so many possibilities it has an endless replay value what this game is to me is a military simulator it has a numerous amount of upgrades from the previous arma 2op arrowhead most importantly the infantry handling and animations that now offer much more flexibility and greater control over your character vehicles none the less have been upgraded the new physx 4 engine gives vehicles a much more realistic feeling lights and scenario rendering have been not only upgraded but made even lighter for your pc to run as opposed to the incredibly heavy arma 2 engine that would put an incredible amount of stress even to the most highend gaming rigs the downside however is that as of now the game doesnt offer much sandbox content as in vehicles and weapons but the developers have already announced future free dlcs that would address this and add some other cool features in conclusion i think this game offers infinite possibilities to those who can take advantage of them but it still needs some time to grow and reach its full potential what well have then will be a game that is going to put to shame all the other commercial fpss

well i could play it for only 15 hours which means i could play on 15th anniversary and 26102011 the game is awesome but seriously guys if you are a cod lover dont get that thing i hate cod already but thats more realstic from battlefield too because thats a milsim you cant jump if you cant play with different controls you are wasting your time here but thats better than most games theres everything i tried i tried the prologue campaign played until a glitch on a mission named damage control which doesnt allows me to continue survive campaign i could continue untill maxvells save bravo team mission i could drive a drone on the virtual reality training but i didnt know what to do with it on bravo campaign i couldnt pass challenges i werent succesful showcases they were very hard i couldnt pass most bunny infestation scenerio wtf was that multpilayer roleplay what a fun it was arsenal scientist uniform with default face white guy vr training couldnt pass placeables dammit map editor i had a experience because that i played ofpr i spawned a plane in air which was me a10 was very easier i couldnt get any addons because of my limited time or before forgetting i was playing when the time ended i still was playing and when closing game said a hour left closed steam said 2 hours left a hour later it still was 2 hours today i cant play

so heres my story on arma3 but before i tell you that i would like to say that dont buy this game if youre not okay with it running horrible because the devs are lazy as  but thats besides the point as i need to tell you my story i started the game and then found a tank within minutes i find myself destroying the entire base and then get banned after being called a little lowlife  1010 would get called a  and banned again

there are several types of gudeg dry wet yogyakarta style solo style and east javanese style dry gudeg has only a bit of coconut milk and thus has little sauce wet gudeg includes more coconut milk the most common gudeg comes from yogyakarta and is usually sweeter drier and reddish in color because of the addition of teak leaves as coloring agent solo gudeg from the city of surakarta and is more watery and soupy with lots of coconut milk and whitish in color because teak leaves are generally not added yogyakartas gudeg usually called red gudeg while solos gudeg also called white gudeg the eastjavanese style of gudeg has a spicier and hotter taste compared to the yogyakarta style gudeg which is sweeter gudeg is traditionally associated with yogyakarta and yogyakarta is sometimes nicknamed kota gudeg city of gudeg the center of yogyakarta gudeg restaurants is in the wijilan area to the east side of the yogy

theres not much to say about arma so many crazy stories come out of it once me and two other friends were scouting around in some woods near some buildings we were loaded up with weapons and some good backpacks we spot a building we wanted to check for loot except theres already about 3 or 4 guys in there from where we could see in the hills so my friends decide its not a good idea to go down there i had a grenade on me i took off my backpack and left my sniper in one place so my friends could take it for me if i died took a grenade and a pistol i launched the grenade high into the air where it exploded confusing the enemy i went rambo into the building with a pistol and took all the guys out so yeah1010 get this game
recommended
ive just now only started playing this and i must say it is amazing best military sim yes 100x yes the realism in this game is something out of a movie it feels like youre there in the moment like youre in the shoes of a soldier on the field the campaign is short but has potential the tutorial explains things minimally but does suffice now to the fun stuff the multiplayer my god if youre someone whos wondering whether or not to buy this game solely based on its multiplayer go right ahead and buy it the people you meet online are so diverse its crazy ive met countless people on arma that were put in my situation and we learned the ropes together it was quite the mess getting yelled at but eventually we got it down im in to shooters but not really into sims yet i love dayz whut but this game really is something else fans of darkrp from the famed gmod will find the altis rp to be quite the upgrade from that when playing it you can really feel the nostalgia from the darkrp craze lastly if you noticed this was made by bohemia and think this game is as broken as dayz please please understand that this game is in no way shape or form like dayz the actual game is playable and so hard to put down when started if you need help deciding on whether or not to buy this let this review help hope to see you in the rpg servers

a vast improvement on the previous titles arma 3 delivers on so many levels many mechanics have been wholly reworked and large steps have been taken to make the game more intuitive and accessible to players new and old one of the most striking leaps in development is the new stance and infantry movement system which along with the new arma 3 control scheme makes it a whole lot easier to control the player as with any addition to a game series the graphics are usually updated and the visuals are absolutely stunning with arma 3 the environments look lifelike and have meticulous detail put into them the detail rivals games which have nowhere near as vast of a game world as altis or stratis there are drawbacks with the game such as a lack of content weapons vehicles and aircraft get boring quickly but with previous titles in the series arma 2 most notably there was a huge drive in dlc and mods providing potentially endless amounts of fun in the included sandbox and level editor optimisation has also drastically improved i receive much higher frames on higher settings than in the previous title which is a real gamechanger all of these improvements have made it so much more fun to play the game there is nothing comparable to playing this game with a large organised team its my personal recommendation that if you were ever interested in the arma series now is the time to purchase and that it is 3999 well spent
recommended
good game fixed most of the arma 2 bugs has its own bugs but ehh l something this big of a scale is going to be bound to have its bugs lags on lower end users and gives advantage to users with better graphical settings my opinion the game deserves a 710

this is one of the most interesting and expansive games out there the current storyline and background is a bit unrealisticthe republic of altis and stratis has a superadvanced military but the nation has under 50000 people in its population the population also is greek but for whatever reason all speaks englisheven the armed forces nonetheless the mission editing is superb compared to arma 2 the mechanics are mostly improved animation and ai needing a bit of a change for realism the voice acting for british and american english as well as farsi is superb iran has a huge presence in the game however it is never mentioned and instead goes under the quite unrealistic banner of cantonprotocol strategic alliance treaty or csat i really wish that bis would at least include the iran flag above the csat insignia on the uniforms for it looked absolutely amazing when this was the case at e3 2011 physics in the game are great however the fabled ragdoll physics are a bit dissapointing all they seem to do is make units die in a more unrealisticlooking way nato is portrayed as completely bankrupt which really bothers meunemployment is at freaking 50% in the us it is interesting to see future interpretations of the us army which use the new multicam pattern in their uniforms i am bothered by the lack of any yes any authentic equipment in the game this is perhaps my biggest problem for it gives the developers an excuse to make fantasy content for every upcoming arma game yes it saves on lisencing but the developers just launched a 650thousand dollar modding contest a fraction of the money could have been spent on making the weapons and vehicles authentic with a host of friends to play with some mods and an open mind this title is one of the most awesome games i have ever played the simulation of the vehicles is amazing with support for almost every joystick controller or other external device you can think of the game fails to provide an immersive atmosphere but is a fun and engaging way to play coop with friends strategy being completely necessary the graphics are in my top 10 games ever and the performance is better than with arma 2 especially if you plan on making youtube videos like i do check out my youtube channel fistogames d  go and buy it with some dlcs that bring it back to where arma 2 was in scenario it will definitely be an amazing game

this game is worth every cent it is extremely realistic and has provided hours of fun for me and my friends

arma 3 brings so much different game types to the table from altis life which is a crazy gta online style clone that is better to full on war simulator with ari land troops there is so much to do in this game if you cant find something to do in this game then you need to get to a doctor quick cause you might be dead  enjoy

100 the graphics for this game are amazing but you may need to turn it down in case of lag the coop is awesome and its great to play with friends also on some servers it will get extremely laggy and hard for you to enjoy the game do research if you can run it before you buy it not a waste of $6000

arma 3 is a solid military simulator that really gets its legs from the modding community many ppl are familar with the arma series for one reason alone and that is the dayz mod its even a well known fact that the game arma 2 sold more copies shortly after dayz was released than it had since its initial release not having played much single player besides a few short training sessions this review is going to be mostly focused on the multiplayer mods gameplay and engine in general first of all i want to say that this game may not be for those with underpowered pcs especially if you are playing multiplayer while the engine performance is dramaticly improved over arma 2 unfortunently it seems that in multiplayer performance will suffer especially with high player counts due to a combination of server performance running an arma server is very resource heavy especially cpu and netcode shortcommings the graphics have been improved over its predecessor as well as performance allowing for even greater view distances than i was able to pull off in arma 2 while still having playable framerates lighting in my opinion seems to have been improved the most leading to many atmospheric moments when i would find myself taking a screenshot models have all been improved quite a bit with the character models receiving the greatest leap in graphic fidelity i can almost feel the stubble on the manly mans face sitting next to me in the attack chopper its the future i tell you as you would expect in a military simulator there is a huge variety of boom sticks and vehicles to play with and not having a knowledge of military equipment or really a lot of experience with arma 2 i wont go into what gunsvehicles are new or what is more or less realistic the gun and vehicle models however have seen a fantastic improvement in overall texture detail and resolution and the animations in general are a giant improvement over previous arma games with many of them appearing to be motion capped for that sexy smoothness gameplay has shown improvement in equal lengths with my favorite additions being the character stance positions revamped inventory system and much more natural feeling to movement in general this is partly due to the fact that animations in general have been improved but also because mouse acceleration and smoothing seem to have been fixed combat feels solid and realistic the effects and sounds of warfare do well to set the mood and convince you that you are really blowing the  out of someone or really in the  the positional audio is fantastic and you can tell the approximate distance of gunshots based on their volume and trust me the sound of a gunshot travels a long long ways i also want to mention your characters sound effects visual effects and ambient animations i love these and they really pull me into the experience i have been walking for nearly 30min and i have finally made it to the cocaine fields but someone saw me comming oblivious i stand collecting the leaves when i hear something and my heart sinks the rustling of feet and whispers in the bushes i panic and turn the way i came bursting into a full sprint as i hear sirens begin to blare out and helicopter blades begin to spin im sprinting at full speed now and the edges of my vision blur as i run blindly into the darkness im breathing more heavily now and my vision is more tunneled than before the color seems to have melted away slightly and i cant focus my eyes still running im breathing so heavy now that i gasp for air at times nearly choking on the air im attempting to breathe the sirens are now far off in the distance and the whirling blades of the helicopter have nearly left ear shot i gasp for more air as i slowly regain a normal rate of breathing i wipe my brow to remove the sweat and my vision finally clears i can see the boat i rode in on still there waiting for me i feel much better now its these little details that make an experience like that feel personal and real this was an experience i had playing the mod altis life everything in the right situation really comes together to bring you into the game experience and this is somthing arma 3 has pulled off well now the mods are where i think arma really shines as they provide infinite replayability assuming the community continues to develop for the platform so far i have to say i am very impressed with the creativity of the mods and the scope of the mods in general want to recreate a historical engagement maybe survive the zombie apocalypse or perhaps selling fish and smoking weed is more your gig you can do it all with the vast array of mods already available but i want to talk quickly about my new favorite mod altis life altis life is a roleplaying mod were you must choose whether you are a civillian or a cop and you must live out you life however you choose civs must make a living whether legal or illegal its you choice and your options are vast for how you do so the cops must keep the civs in line and enforce the laws if you are running around smoking weed and yelling fck the police you are probably gonna get pulled over beaten and arrested play it cool and do the speed limit maybe you will get away with that trunk full of heroin and get rich quick or maybe you just want to pick peaches smoke your weed and claim its for medical purposes when the cops pull you over its your choice and it is really great fun there is so much more to say about this game and the potential it has with the fantastic modding community but ive written too much here already and im tired so im going to bed on second thought maybe ill just do one more run to the poppy fields

well if you like cod then gtfo cuz this is arma 3 by far the best game i have ever play with dota 2 in close second it is a must have and is dope

this game it might sometimes be glitchy and bugs might arise everywhere and you might look dead when your really not but it really does come down to how epic this game can get full scale tank battles with air support and noobies everywhere with overpowered rocket launchers thats my vision how of epic this game can get but thats how i like it you make it what ever you want being a sandbox only limit is no nukes d but that would be way overpowered just imagine n00bies setting off like 100 nukes i dont think anybody would enjoy that l 1010

arma 3 is a game with simulation elements its not a simulator it is also a game for a specific type of gamer that prefers large scale warfare instead of playing casual fastpaced shooters like cod or bf if you enjoy the experience from briefing and planning  and executing a plan  no matter how it plays out the game adapts to any playing style that fits your style run & gun still works but you need to have some uber micro skills if your mission fails arma allows you to retreat and get out alive or gives you the oppertunity to get it done in another way thats a nice touch compared to games that usually let the game end right after a fail sp a bullet in the head will kill you a bullet in your ballistic helmet might save your life get shot in your legs and youre have to crawl your way out of there things you have to consider in real life come close to the decisions you have to make in this game playing multiplayer with a group of people make the experience even better but this game isnt really finished while the tags say its a full release bohemia keeps working for years on these games to improve and add more content theyve done the same thing to their previous titles if you really care about multiplayer i suggest arma 2 co procons   mission editor large scale warfare mods armaholic & bis forums steam workshop  user generated mission content mods in future all kinds of vehicles air cars armor support and so on 270 km2 map to explore  multiplayer performance still crap air vehicle mhah lost turnspeed please add a slider to have us configurate our own speed on pedals setting sensitivity to high still have slow pedal movement >_< those small choppers are able to quickly rotate  but now its a slow  long and horrible turn no coop in campaign coop game plox ai moves unnatural they behave like androids

updated review i have been exploring more features of arma 3 and i love it i have been playing a bit of the standard arma 3 features which are fun but the sheer number of mods and workshop missions is unreal this game is so flexible my most favourite mods and missions i have been playing are altis life think along the lines of gta but everyone ever where is a real player the police military bandits civilians criminals everyone it is a very immersive mission where you do what you want whenever you want earn money through doing legal jobs or become a criminal and traffic drugs rob banks rob other players do whatever you want to survive but beware your actions could get you on the police wanted list buy food weapons vehicles licenses and so much more it is a great experience when your on an active server escape altis an online coop game which can also be played single player your goal to escape the huge island of altis you will encounter ai enemy`s in all kinds of locations choose how you get through stealthy or guns blazing do it your way this mission is very challenging and lots of fun best with mates breaking point think dayz but on a bigger map less glitches and now a choice of 5 factions to choose from each with their own perks rules or none depending which you choose and appearance breaking point provides 5 maps altis stratis thirsk summer and thirsk winter the thirsk maps are pvp orientated with survival thrown in for good measure stratis is bigger than than thirsk maps with a bigger focus on survival against zombies and other players altis is just huge while breaking point is still in its infancy the dev team is working really hard at it and adding new features and maps frequently vehicles in this mod are fairly rare so expect work to be done finding them you will also have to fix them up to get them working to i love the arma 3 engine it is so flexible and allows for so many different ways to play it just never gets dull i highly recommend it

fun times to be had ignore all the issues and play the game when you get down to it killing hapless peasants at range with a 50 cal and thermal optics is just as fun as gunning them down from across the street with a lmg this game is at its best when you are on your own behind enemy lines with nothing but abdul the condenscending persian and your t100 you can fire from behind a house or in a hull down position at the backs of unsuspecting armor infantry or the occasional aircraft fall back and repeat while the smoke fills the sky and peasants burn to their horrid deaths in the end the game has some flaws but thats to be expected in a game this size regardles of that i love this game 910 would use as trophy wife

arma 3 is the most detailed combat simulator you can find for a pc  theres much improvement from arma 2  including smarter ui more natural feeling movement and so on community support is excellent with mods and scenarios created by the day keeping the game fresh for a long time a must buy if you are looking for a more serious shooter than your average counterstrike
recommended
when you look at most of the customer reviews on typical games youll generally see anywhere from 28 hours of playtime looking through the reviews for arma 3 a majority that i see are over 100 hours and quite a few over 300400 hours i think that speaks for itself
recommended
i just love playing this game 3
recommended
very cool game love the campaign and the mods avaialble are limitless
recommended
great game bro

the greatest accomplishment a game can have is to leave lasting memory with the player i find that this is especially true for memories that you can share arma 3 can provide these in abundance it is easily one of the best sandbox games i have ever played ill never forget escaping from a temporary prison with a handful of friends spending hours slowly and stealthily making our way to a heavily guarded communication tower taking out an entire platoon in a surprise attack and finally making contact with friendly forces for extraction only to be told to rendezvous on the opposite side of the island of course the enjoyment of these games is also dependent on the people that you play it with so be sure to pester all your good friends so that they can play this with you for as graphics and physics heavy as this game is it handles surprisingly well gameplay wise you will have to relearn everything youve been taught for fpss if youre not extremely careful and working as a team youre going to die swiftly and painfully the number of player made missions is amazing this game has a bit of a learning curve but not nearly as much as the previous titles in the series please if you want to have some fun with friends get this game

i m going to be honest it isnt such good as arma 2 despite better optimizationgraphic and zeus  zeus is really good but its hard to use unofficial addons to run zeus correctly is more drawbacks what i have to say it wasnt fell like arma anymore but like cod or bf unreal weaponsammo units vehicles body armor system  the biggest problem at all in my opinion  it was probably mented like good think but if you shoot soldier twice in chest he cannot be able to return fire ok he may survive but that should be all positive think is free bootcamp  but it doesnt fully support addons what is sad virtual arsenal loadouts re not able ti share in zeus when i said is positive it was because its free what is not common in nowadays but you can as normal add addons and mods in arma what makes it playable again in result  arma 3 is worth to buy for common player only because zeus nothing more have any value if you re arma enthusiast like me and you are going to play arma 3 with mods and addons its good improvement after arma 2 more support more mod and addon makers bigger maps
recommended
i came from fps games like call of duty and battlefield those games are fun but in the end they are arcade style they dont offer you a real taste of what it is really like to shoot a gun or being hit by a bullet red orchestra 2 came a little closer to real combat but arma 3 is the most realistic military simulator ever despite the fact that it requires great effort to even kill someone with a gun recoil sight stability etc it is fun to play this game at least you understand you cant run across a map for 10 minutes straight get hit by 10 bullets and still regenerate this is the real deal its not too friendly to new players but the challenging aspect is intriguing enough to keep you going
recommended
well after more than 450 hours on record i have to say it is the best game in the last years there is so much to do with it seemingly unlimited ways to modify the game or to make own missions with nearly unlimited access to everything you need it deserves just one word awesome

awesome game there is so much you can do here everything from sandbox to tactical realism both the multiplayer and singleplayer areas have huge playability levels plus new content is being added weekly so you never get bored awesome game one of my all time favorites highly recommend
recommended
i shot a guy in the head with a 30mm cannon at point blanc and he didnt die 1010
recommended
this game is really good i would give it a 910 and the reason i give it such a high rating is because there are endless things to do such as altis life or maybe tactical missions but my favorite part of the game is flying there is the standard flying which is sorta like a arcade flying but still has some realistic features then there is advanced flying but besides that this game is just great before i had this game i was a lone wolf on arma 2 but on here i met a awesome group of people that i play arma 3 with every night we even have are own altis life server
recommended
the game is great it is a very realistic war simulator that i highly recommend it makes call of duty look like dog poop there are a lot of mods that are fun to play you can do just about anything in this game fly helos drive quads trucks tanks shoot people and much more it just makes me mad that i bought it for $5999 three days ago and today it is on sale for $2999 1110 would pay full price again
recommended
this is a very good game

lets see i have put 530 hours on arma ii and 230 on arma iii is this a good game yes it is a military shooter that focuses on scale there is some realism and some not its a video game so of course there will be reality breaking moments do the sounds of rifles crack yes grenades that explode near you will shake you up and be loud the sounds in this game are amazing from the hum of the chopper as it starts up to the rumble of your tank you will feel like you are in this breathing world of military hardware the moment the game starts up the graphics are amazing there are times when i simply stare off into the horizon in awe at how large the map is you can customize your character for a more immersive feel in game there are mods and various game modes from deathmatch to king of the hill and dayz epoch there is something for every fps fan the gameplay mechanics and controls are deep be ready for about 8 different key strokes for how you can take cover but it works in its favor as you want to have the most concealed firing position yet be able to hit your target so peeking around corners from low to the ground rocks and more make combat from mountains or close quarters dynamic and fresh piloting a heli or driving a tank is easy to pick up and rewarding when you master it for airplanes you may find the controls difficult as having a stick is the best and easiest way to effectively pilot some players only pilot and use only the joystick in multiplayer there are really cool workshop game modes you can download and play solo or with friends 1010 i highly recommend this game due to its gameplay controls and graphics if you enjoyed the arma series you will love this game and if you like military shooters with some realism you will also enjoy picking this game up
recommended
arma 3 gives me a hard on whenever i open itjust the smell of the cover makes me want to murder a puppy and  on a newborn baby with cancer like cause iam just so indie like that its like the love of my life i dont need a girlfriend because i have my arma 3 by my side my non indie friend rory evans hates this game cause he is not indie like me it gives me more to do around the house other than thinking bout ways to kill myself or how to make the news with the next big mass school killing

ive just now only started playing this and i must say it is amazing best military sim yes 100x yes the realism in this game is something out of a movie it feels like youre there in the moment like youre in the shoes of a soldier on the field the campaign is short but has potential the tutorial explains things minimally but does suffice now to the fun stuff the multiplayer my god if youre someone whos wondering whether or not to buy this game solely based on its multiplayer go right ahead and buy it the people you meet online are so diverse its crazy ive met countless people on arma that were put in my situation and we learned the ropes together it was quite the mess getting yelled at but eventually we got it down im in to shooters but not really into sims yet i love dayz whut but this game really is something else fans of darkrp from the famed gmod will find the altis rp to be quite the upgrade from that when playing it you can really feel the nostalgia from the darkrp craze lastly if you noticed this was made by bohemia and think this game is as broken as dayz please please understand that this game is in no way shape or form like dayz the actual game is playable and so hard to put down when started if you need help deciding on whether or not to buy this let this review help hope to see you in the rpg servers

i started up arma 3 yesterday with my mate we were playing on a wasteland server for about 2 hours we got lots of loot and it was awesome he had a ghillie and i had a scuba suit we swam to an island but he was slower in swimming so i went down to the bottom of the sea to get him a scuba suit we saw 2 down there and while i was doing this i noticed that one of the suits moved both of them got up and started shooting us underwater we died and lost our loot 1010 pirates took our booty hole

i think that a lot of people are afraid of this game because they see the ultrarealistic warfare videos made in this game on youtube but you really shouldnt be this game isnt just for those realism enthusiasts this game is also for those who like sandbox games you can create your own scenarios to play with friends or alone the editor is very great in this game right off the bat but if you take some time to learn the more advanced options of it youll be able to create some really neat scenarios you can create a hostage rescue mission a gokart race course and many more this is really fun to play around with by yourself if you dont have friends that are into this game the game is very well optimized taking a huge step from arma 2 theres a lot of free content being put into the game such as new guns vehicles and many bug fixes every month the game is constantly being updated to provide the best experience online gives you a huge variety of scenarios from zombie survival to battlefieldstyle conquest even to regular deathmatch in small to large areas there are lots of guns in this game that can all be customized with various scopes magazines flashlights and more the gameplaycontrols take a while to get used to because they are so weird at first but eventually everything will make sense and feel very natural though you will have to relearn it if you take a long break from playing the game like i did when i stopped playing for a month or so overall the game is very great especailly with friends on your own scenarios id reccommend this game mainly to lovers of sandbox games for how easily moddable it is and how easy it is to create scenarios 910 my favorite in the arma series

fantastic game and beautiful in every way if you can hit good frames on ultra otherwise unfortunately its pretty computer hungry so ill have to hold off from playing this until i can afford a better gpu fantastic realism massive environment the community online is great most times big learning curves if youre into that the only thing that i really wanted was an ability to put on some creedence on while flying towards our ao

i came from fps games like call of duty and battlefield those games are fun but in the end they are arcade style they dont offer you a real taste of what it is really like to shoot a gun or being hit by a bullet red orchestra 2 came a little closer to real combat but arma 3 is the most realistic military simulator ever despite the fact that it requires great effort to even kill someone with a gun recoil sight stability etc it is fun to play this game at least you understand you cant run across a map for 10 minutes straight get hit by 10 bullets and still regenerate this is the real deal its not too friendly to new players but the challenging aspect is intriguing enough to keep you going

arma 3 is an awesome rpg just buy it

my quick review arma 3 is probably the most user friendly entry into the series not to the mention the best looking and in my opinion the most fun to play now thats not to say doesnt have issues currently not as much content as the previous entries but that said bis is working on more and its soon to come obviously the modder community is working feverishly away steam workshop support for missions is great and as soon as they add support for full mods everything will be even better the game plays as one would expect its a tactical simulator so that means the average expericance wont be a firefight every few seconds tehre is waiting there is walking but if youre of the right mindset it all adds to the experience and build up knowing only a few shots can kill you make it quite tense key points the new stance system is great a variable height and lean means you can make the most out of any cover you find yourself in  the maps are huge and varied with the scenario editor you can quickly whip up any type of engagement you want  the game is better multiplayer if your more of a solo player i wouldnt say youll have no fun but i think itd be more limited  so many mods on the horizon all will add up to be the experience you want tailored to you so all that said i love this game devs are continuining support with regular updates and additions join a multiplayer community and prepare to have a blast

love this game i keep spending all my hours on it

im not a massive fps gamer but then i dont really count this game as a fps its not like battlefied cod or any of those types of titles this is a combat simulator and i have been immidiately impressed with the single player campaign which i normally dont play the game doesnt feel as responsive as some newer titles bf4 but its realism to me seems excellent i dont know of course ive never been in a war and hope i never have too  but playing this game makes me feel about as close as id want to get i only started playing this game really after playing dayz standalone and will definately be continuing the explore it further
recommended
an amazing game with incredible potential
recommended
while there are still a few bugs it really is a great game much better than arma 2 highly recommended

bohemia interactives arma 3 is the lastest iteration of a longrunning series of realistic military sandbox titles where the common themes have consistently centred upon player freedom flexibility of action and movement an expansive open world setting an impressive degree of virtual realism and a passionate player community set in the near future arma 3 presents the player with the sprawling highfidelity terrain of altis a wartorn mediterranean island in the agean sea caught up in the building tensions between nato and the growing influence of an eastern military alliance known as csat this simmering geopolitical state of play serves as the core backdrop to the titles 3part singleplayer campaign and persists as the central theme and justification of the games simulated conflict the island of altis itself is an immense detailed and truly immersive canvas upon which the player is free to realise practically any military scenario of their imagining where the journey from point a to point b can easily encompass many kilometres and where topography and geographic features can collude to radically alter player tactics based loosely upon the real island of lemnos altis is able to achieve a uniquely natural feel to its coasts rolling hills and forests and stands as a great testament to the skill and dedication of bohemia interactives map designers even while pinned under withering enemy fire one cannot help but be struck by its beauty and authenticity arma 3 also offers up a plethora of nearfuture military hardware from various firearms transports logistical supports infantry fighting vehicles main battle tanks helicopters as well as fighter jets and boats the assets are generally very well modelled with distinct individual characteristics which make driving a quadbike a very different experience from that of a lumbering metal behemoth while the helicopter flight dynamics are driven by bohemias optional challenging but immensely rewarding advanced flight model fixedwing aircraft in arma 3 remain the begrudging recipients of a comparatively rudimentary flight model that is perhaps a reflection of the series traditional focus on groundcentric gameplay given the near future setting it is pertinent to note that much of the titles military assets are modelled upon reallife prototype weaponry as well as a few present day variations met with a degree of developer artistic licence and fabricated designations this notable departure from the wellestablished and popular modern day armaments that featured so prominently within previous titles in the series is undoubtedly a bold move by bohemia and one that still remains a divisive point of discussion within the player community the sounds of arma 3 traditionally a less impressive facet of previous titles in the series has undergone a marked improvement in this latest offering sustained postlaunch updates to sound attenuation supersonic bullet cracks along a general reboot of the veracity of weapon fire in general have improved arma 3s soundscape immeasurably ensuring that the aural experience of its virtual warfare remains an authentic often terrifying but ultimately satisfying assault upon the senses arma 3 also comes bundled with an incredibly powerful mission editing suite which places the player in complete control of the entirety of the games imposing asset list it is in this mode perhaps more so than any other where the title truly shines as a sandbox experience with a little practice and experimentation the player is able to construct fully realised military scenarios of varying complexity for themselves their friends or the community at large with objectives limited only by the bounds of the authors imagination this uninhibited freedom a cornerstone of the series remains wonderfully present within arma 3s core offering it would be almost criminally irresponsible to discuss bohemias flagship franchise without a brief mention of armas imperious modding community and the staggering host of improvements fixes overhauls and tweaks that this vibrant collection of talented indivduals provides whether one seeks to reintroduce reallife armies and modernday weapon sets to their virtual arsenal to aquaint oneself with a fresh new terrain upon which to wage war or to apply a simple yet powerful overhaul to realism the impressive array of usermade mods make this possible player created content has persisted as an important keystone of the series appeal and longevity since its debut and continues to form an integral part of arma 3s broader experience players new to the series may find themselves understandably intimidated by the sheer bredth and depth of the content on offer not to mention some of the more unforgiving aspects of the simulation thankfully boehemia interactive have introduced a host of means to facilitate the familiarisation process in the form of an ingame field manual and hint system an introductory campaign a tronesque virtual reality terrain and even providing the means for more experienced players to act as drill instructors to teach newer players the ropes online while a handful of frustrating ai user interface animation and optimisationstability querks persist bohemia interactive have created what is easily the most accessible title in the franchise to date as a reflection of arma 3s flexibility this is a title that has come to mean many different things to its expansive playerbase and one that can be played in a huge variety of different modes and playstyles as a result arma 3 perhaps more so than any previous iteration in the series has seemed to grapple increasingly with the fallout of its own versatility attempting to establish a consensus on exactly how the game should be played has become an increasingly tenuous prospect and one that is arguably unnecessary in the creation of arma 3 bohemia interactive has taken upon the unenviable task of treading the fine middleground that exists between sustaining the high degree of realism that the series is famous for while attempting to preserve fun and engaging gameplay for newcomers or those unacclimatised to a realistic simulation experience realism itself has proven to be an immensely subjective term within a virtual setting and one that invariably means vastly different things to different players the finer points of the titles realism with respect to certain game features remains a continual point of contention within the player community and one that appears unlikely to abate any time soon arma 3s greatest triumphs then are to be found in its versatility and impressive openworld gameplay players are offered near total freedom a staggering choice of armament and a mandate to pursue their objectives however they see fit employing tactics entirely of their own design this is a hugely layered and expansive sandbox title offering the player a unique gameplay experience and a gaming platform that has earned the rightful praise of many loyal fans

well arma 3 arma 3 personally this is my favorite war game and maybe even my favorite war game of all time reason being is due ot its heartbeating intense firefights espicially when you get along with some freinds and mods and completely make arma into a full on military simulator i honestly think arma 3 campaign has a great story mode to it every special part of the campaign made me want to not quit it intense scripting and story line for sure graphics wise i think arma 3 has amazing graphics for a computer game however the bad thing is you need a really buffed up computer to do it need a new graphics cardvideo card and maybe even a new motherboard or cpu will help arma 3 multiplayer is outstanding its one of the best multiplayer communitys out there for its great teamwork players and amazing gamemodes like altis life wasteland and invade and annex if you love battlefield call of duty or any other war fpsrealism war games this is the game for you and its worth the money

this game is absolutely beautiful some of my best moments have been on this game not only is the vanilla game absolutely brilliant but the modding community is also spectacular you can play as marines army navy whatever you choose that being said some further optomization is necessary as this game has major lag spikes and crazy fps drops even in singleplayer i have played for 300 hours and have yet to play the campaign its great if you are wondering what this game requires graphics card wise i am playing with a msi radeon r9 270x which is a mid range card on all ultra at average of 5060 fps on singleplayer for a long time i was playing with a nvidia geforce 610 which is a low end card but wsa still able to play and had great expierences with so overall no matter what your specs are buy this game if your specs arent quite good enough to run it on ultra or high the sheer gameplay expierences will make you want to invest mor time and of course more money on pc games gameplay 1010 graphics 910 fps 710 storyline from what ive seen from others and from the few missions i have dabbled in 910 overall 910 would play

well i only have 100 hours on this one but thats enaugh after ive played nearly 2000 hours of arma 2 oa with and without the dayz mod440 or so hours wasteland 220 hours on a single dayz server and about 150  200 on multiple other dayz epoch servers via dayz commander the game is simply improved it runs better than the old one does at least on my system looks great is less clunky the game is set in future i dislike this bit is a time cow as alaways to newcomers this game takes time there are no quick 10 minute rounds the meat of the game for me is on 120 people wasteland servers where it takes time to get gear takes time to travel takes time to siege and objective and so on an average paly session will last from 2 hours and up if you want to acctualy acomplish something 1010 would recomend if you can run it howerver id simply suggest picking up arma 2 when its avalible for 5 or less euros since the price is quite steep when not on sale and youre either going to love this like i do or hate it its not comparable to battlefield or call of duty and even more so its false to think that liking any of those games will make you like arma as well also when deciding on making your purchase take a good hard look will you be able to run this game and if can play a game on 30 fps im all pc master race guy with atleast full hd and 60fps as a requirment however without the latest and greatest rig its hard to swim around 60fps in this title sp runs well very well even but when it comes to mp your expierence is close to unpredictable on some servers youll be running great and on some youll have 10fps no matter what you do this game is uniqe its more like tools and materials that can be used to create a beautifull house than the house itself if you want to expierence the construction of your house rather than getting one already built there is no better title than this one

this game is definitely a direct improvement over arma 2 if you are familiar with that game it is very easy to transition over to this game i especially enjoy the mission editor the mission editor has a pretty steep learning curve but enough tutorials and trial and error will get you competent with the editors logic the game is much better optimized than arma 2 was but it still runs pretty awful on multiplayer even with a high spec pc i ended up having to turn down my view distance to a pretty low amount to consistently get 40 fps on multiplayer because the fps largely relies on the servers power on single player or a small server of 510 people i could just about max out the game with a steady 60 fps i am disappointed with the dlc though as it really doesnt add much at all to the game at this point and it retails at $25 i would recommend picking this game up even if you have never played the other arma games because it seems like it has a much smaller learning curve than previous titles but is still just as indepth this game is a good purchase especially on sale the dlc on the other hand is not currently worth it

amazing game especially altis life some people say sixty dollars isnt worth it it is altis life and the workshop content are aspiring over expectations of most mod players the base game is pretty good pretty complicated though i would say the mods are the best of this game like of course garrys mod altis life is my favorite i play battle royale occasionally but my secondary gamemode that i play in the downtime of my favorite altis life server is king of the hill amazing gamemode also to mention this game just like arma 2 is extremely moddable unlike all ea games and lets say triple a games all and all its worth sixty dollars and is a must buy there are some downsides to this game like arma 2 not that well of optimization extremely better than arma 2 but thats my opinion also dsync is a problem to some servers and you will have problems if you have a terrible internet company like me would buy again 910

great simulator no wonder it won the award its just at the right pace not too fast not too slow theres no health regeneration so if you get shot youre either going to have to patch yourself up or just tread with a wounded arm or leg best of all no one fusses about it theres no call of duty vs battlefield wars no ubisoft bandwagon hate its just arma iii

you want a game where everything is close quarters combat you want a game where you can see your enemy shooting you you want a game where your health regenerates and youre able to survive several shots to the face you want a game where the vehicles are extremely easy to operate and pretty much nearly invincible you want a game where the guns are easy to aim and you need absolutely no experience to use them you want a game where the map is nice and small and compact and is perfectly practical to walk across sorry but this game is not for you 1010

i will rate this game very 5 ways very specificlly 1 5 points for physicsballistics very life like 2 5 points for gameplaystyle if your looking for that real gritty down to earth combat experiance this is your game 3 4 points for diversity  from weps vehicle guns its not too much and not too little just right although perhaps a few more rifles 4 4 points for tactical in order to be succesful you must work as a team in this game i didnt give it 5 because of the lack of communication quality between squads 5 1 point for optimization horrible horrible optimization good or bad pc we all basically get the same level of performance wth higher end pcs pbvoiusly getting a little tiny bit better performance this is the major flaw which can kill this game for some fortunatly for me i have a pretty powerful rig so i can opt out 3137 fps in cities with 75 people online which in all honesty is ridiculous but boehemia is what it is my honest opinion if you sick of disneylike run and gun war games liek bf4 or cod and want a more real play experience \ id reccomend this game highly warning if you think you are going to get amazing graphics and above 40 fps lol you are either nuts or rich you will need the top of the line n i mean at least $2500 rig to run this game max at 60fps but you can still run it at mediumhighish and hope to get 30fps well good luck and make the best descision

arma is one of the best games i have ever played but be warned it is nothing like your mainstream shooter like battlefield or call of duty arma presents you with quite a challenge because the ai is hard and unforgiving sometimes even unfair and weapons vehicles and damage all feel quite realistic i recommend getting the dlc pack with it and as soon as it releases getting the expansion the dlcs bring cool new content to the game and it is a great way to additionally support the developers arma can also be greaty improved with mods to anyone new to the game check out mods like tfar ace3 asr ai and rhsescalation

it must be said again and again the arma series is not compareable to any cinematic driven action packed shooters and if you dont like teambased multiplayer you wont get too much fun out of it since the singleplayer campaign seems to be more like an extra this said the third armed assault gives you everything you need for the most realistic and intense battle experience possible you might complain about the near future setting which made it even harder for me to leave my beloved chernarus arma 2 behind but you wont stumble over pulse rifles et cetera furthermore youll get a huge sandbox world an editor to do in it whatever you want and a fine community that never sleeps so what else should i recommend right now buy it dont wait for more content and lower pricing the war has already begun edit best game ever  777 hours edit nope not at all arma 2 was so much better this p2wdlc system sucks balls dry by the way theres still absolutely no use for planes in this one best game ever ive must been really drunk when i wrote that i still recommend this one but only cause it became nearly impossible to play a2 online

i find the mechanics of this game to be incredibly hard to master i have played this game for over 100 hours and im still unbelievably horrible at it its a simple process getting into the game however simply plug in your n64 controller and try not to tap a wall with your hatchback

ok well im not entirely sure what to put here but in my experience of the game its a bit like pancakes so here is the recipe for success ingredients 1 large egg or 1 egg and one yolk  pint280ml milk 4oz110g plain flour 4 heaped dessertspoons 1 tbsp melted butter method by hand sift the flour into a bowl and make a well in the middle break in the egg and yolk if using and add a pinch of salt and a splash of the milk whisk the egg gradually incorporating the flour to make a smooth cream whisk in the rest of the milk and the melted butter with a blender put all the ingredients in a blender jug with a pinch of salt whizz until smooth it should be no thicker than single cream brush a hot pan with vegetable oil before adding a ladleful of batter and swilling thinly around pan tipping the pan so the mixture spreads evenly it will begin to cook immediately pour any excess back into the bowlwhen the pancake is browned on the bottom and the very edges are beginning to lift away give the pan a shake to make sure the pancake is loose if it is sticking anywhere use a spatula to loosen it when it moves freely then you are ready to toss it  or if youre less confident use a spatula to turn it over the other side will only need a few seconds slide out of the pan and try one of these delicious toppings

i was actually one of the first people to preorder this games supporter edition on march 5th 2013 and so far the game evolved from a 7810 military shooter with emphasis on realism to a 1210 military simulator the probably best mod support of any game currently on the market and an extensive community that happily accepts new players if youre searching for realistic military operations in a videogame arma is for you if youre searching for some open world roleplaying or general tvt action arma is for you if you would like to be part of a group that conducts coop andor tvt missions together arma is for you additionally one very huge part of this game is the mod support literally anything you can imagine ranging from fictional spaceships to realistically modeled main battle tanks as well as all accompanying features can be downloaded and used in game just a few mods i would recommend checking out jsrs 3 dragonfyre the successor to the very popular jsrs2 for arma3 and the previous jsrs for arma2 this soundmod delivers a high fidelity realism oriented sound environment i would strongly recommend checking out a few videos on the official jsrs studios youtube channel if you didnt know that its a mod for a videogame you would probably think that the sounds are part of actual combat footage thats the fidelity you can expect from jsrs blastcore phoenix jsrs is for sounds blastcore phoenix is for visuals blastcore phoenix which is also currently in developement is the successor of the very popular blastcore mods for arma2 and arma3 this mod delivers realistic high quality explosion and smoke effects while still maintaining good ingame performance if you want to check this mod out make sure that youre specificially searching for blastcore phoenix as the new mod is quite a lot different from the old ones rhs escalation this mod is actually split up into two mods and has been released only a couple of days ago it brings very high quality contemporary russian and american assets into the game including vehicles weapons and uniforms despite the mod being in a very early stage at version 030 it already has considerably more content than the main game this mod is definitely worth being checked out authentic gameplay modification this mod could be regarded as the successor for the advanced combat environment 1 and 2 modifications for arma2 they take this game from being somewhat beginner friendly and while already very realistic to a simulation that may be mistaken with vbs the military training simulator developed by a sub company of bohemia interactive this mod may not be for everyone but if youre looking for the most realistic military experience that can be delivered by a game this mod is definitely worth checking out advanced combat radio environment or task force arrowhead radio these two mods which actually could be considered rivals provide the game with very realistic communication in form of an overhauled von and simulated real world radio models they also come with a very high fidelity ui they achieve all this by using a teamspeak plugin the tldr of this would be should you get arma yes

with over 600 hours of play time plus probably about 200 more on another account i had this is hands down one of the best games i have ever played not because its such a rock solid game with a good story as a matter of fact im sure about %80 of people playing this never played the story probably about %40 of arma players didnt even know it had one but this game does something that all games should its a swiss army knife of video games its developers decided to open the game up to modders and developers creating countless communities of life servers milsim servers koh wasteland battle royale and countless others whom i maybe have not yet discovered no other game out there has such a vast veriaty of different game modes that allow the player to do whatever he or she wants to do at the time this game takes it self seriously yet at the same time it knows how to tell a joke or two like its driving mechanics and vehicle damage its quite funny sometimes when you first hop into arma 3 you will want to go right to the multiplayer and load up one of the life servers it has which i think is the 2nd reason why this game is so popular first being the dayz mod and subsequently the dayz sa all in all if you are looking for a game that will alow you to play a rebel one day a cop the next and a military member the day after look no further this versitile platform is exactly right for you i actually have started to compare this to gta and quite frankly i have more hours in this than gta i fully recommend this game to everyone sale or full price its well worth it
recommended
i have spent quite a long time playing this game and developing for it pros graphics systems weapon attchements ect combat vehicles feal more realistic physics are 100 times better than arma 2 cons feals incomplete mods almost feal neccesarry for vetran amra fans paid dlc on a small scale arma 2 dlc inluded weapons features maps and a new campaign not 2 helicopters and a sling system community has went downhill since the introduction of dayz in arma 2 but has improved snce standalone mod support still hasnt improved performance multiplayer desync overview i love arma and i allways will but the new dlc system and lack of content left a bad taste in my mouth but overall the game holds up to its features and premise of a arma game just expect to downoad alot of mods for those aks and ars you like 8 out of 10 for this game time logged when this review was posted is 615 hours of ingame time

it is the military simulator or something like it anyway it aint a cod fps no not even a battlefield so much action game even better or worse many features such as weapon attachments underwater ops oh did i mention aviation pros  very very tactical maybe too tactical  open world limited to whatever people can figure out  so many possible missions you just need to find them  so much mods so many many mods in fact maybe too many  often medium to long range realistic combat which is usually really hard to hit enemies  many features since first game release such as shooting from vehicles and virtual reality  realistic graphics limited to your hardware or your nerves for lag  many more cons  too tactical yep sometimes enemy ais are a step ahead of you  with big content and graphics comes great hardware requirements  modifications that may be too big to download

arma 3 is a fantastic simulation of military combined arms warfare successfully creating an authentic envirmoment unrivaled to any other and hightech modes of transport to visit every inch of it though you may need a high performance computer to run this game even on the lowest settings you can enjoy it from enthrawling hour long witchhunts on wastelands to one of the best first person shooter campaigns of all time im sure you will find something that you will look back on and say that was freaking awesome create your own mission and play with friends with the ingame editor where you can achieve the same height of perfection as in the official campaign i whole heartedly dont regret any of the hours that i have put into this game and would recomend it to anyone who is willing to play properly as a team and is willing to follow the rules of the servers becuase when you do the game turns into a multimillion pound movie inwhich you are the main character and you choose what happens this game is bloody epic

tested the game during the free weekend on 20142610 i have played arma 2 and i am a fanatic of realistic militarytactical simulations like the first ghost recons rainbox six americas army insurgency etc note that right now i am at the tipping point mission and i only played single player btw i cannot finish the mission since i cannot for the life of me get into the speeboat i can drown under it though i also completed the entire tutorial which was very well made 1 for this however the first impression of this game aint good the simulation part is very lacking  simulation nah for real the first missions goes way too fast  to the point that my dude is always totally tired following the team leader everyone moves around and in the end they get shot you end up the only one remaing and have lone wolf your way to the rest of the mission i was expecting a very slow pacing like ghost recon nope team runs ahead and they dont wait for you since i try to loot bodies to build up a nice gear and be confortable i stay behind while my team rushes away i even didnt do jack in a mission since they were rushing so fast that they completed the objectives all by themselves i was litterally crawling my way and looting sht while they were sprinting ahead mission completed by the ai only lol wow weapon handling is basic and very accurate i meant too much accurate i havent noticed any bullet drop when shooting over 200 meters for instance no compensation was required just aim and shoot tangos accuracy however is insane they drop to prone and headshot you i couldnt test a sniper wwapon though but no jams fast realoding wether your mag is in a pouch or or backpack it magically appears in your hand and goes straight to the mag well the gear now is mission specific i litterally spent hours on customizing my gear to prepare for the next mission looting dead bodies and stuff optimizing weight now the end of the day approaches and night comes so im like hopefully i grabbed some nvgs and i have an ir laser yeah next mission starts my gear has been stripped backpack has disapeared vest too and i end up with a short barel weapon a fcking flashlight and my  to fight while of course everyone else is tanked with 30lbs of nades nvgs and stuff like that i regroup and i am given an nvg and a laser great but why now in the middle of nowhere when we were 1 click away from base wtf i even tried because i was so pssed that at every mission i start basically naked i tried to go back to base on foot yeah climb that hill up and base is there but nope radio says turn the fck around soldier you are walking towards a minefield ahah so im like avoid the thousand claymores scattered around when i suddently die i was not moving in other word linear and im not done raging on the gear yet  yes soldiers aint supposed to have custom gear i am fine with that what i am not fine with is being the only one in the team that has dck which is totally incomprehensible since hq has gear and stuff so why at the missiong overview when we see the map we can customize the gear there but no support item is available which mean that my lovely prepared backpack is gone with everything inside of it gone forever man waste of time clearly a game for nonthinking players hop in mission play dont loot because no time and dont question your gear you sht soldier and also you cant have a custom gear but you can loot the opfor and take their weapons ever heard of never picking up a tango weapon because it could be ied rigged uh simulation hmm nope as for the scenario its pretty bad imho mean soldiers attacking civies and then nato the latter having to defend itself so 4 nato guys against 30 tangos is fine no big deal missions are scripted and loosing a team member will not trigger a mission failure hopefully nothing much though a lot of walking around not much tactics there but at least some strats could be cool sometimes there is flanking but not much want to use smokes what are those for we rush dead on on tangos the ia can see tangos behind hills yeah my own dude can see an unknown contact on the east 15 clicks away damn man you good httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid332462626 i end up shooting at the hud squares that my buddies report i cant even see the enemies that are super far away behind bushes tree branches and stuff how the hell can they spot them while running like crazy >> simulation you said getting hit doesnt make you fall on your ss it does in aa if i remember correctly however your accuracy will be screwed or not really your movements becomes eratic like your iron sights move around by themselves but it is still unreal tournament accurate provided you shoot at the right timing when the crosshair is right on the tango i like better the arma 2 overall weapon experience with the weird deforming crossair like rainbow six that way you cannot see where your shots will land in the end having played a lot of americas army 2 and a bit less of aa3 arma 3 is good yeah but definitely less realistic that those both insurgency stays the best simulation so far but its not an army sandbox sim it is way more focused on cqb finally the default game setting are much too easy tougher armor can seeing in real time your buddies moving on the map you can see how many bullets are left etc not a simulation try the elite settings instead and remove the crosshair in addition now we are talking other stuff graphics  i say awesome configuring this is easy and seamless fps are computed while tweaking options which is super great 1 for this but no fov configuration so thats 1 game tweaking  awesome again colorblind people be not afraid well not that much anyway you can change the ingame hud colors which means that way points tangos spots and stuff can be customized yeah the base color were blending for me with the surroundings so i changed the colors to very bright yellow now i can see remember though that everyone has bdu and its all green brown hence i have a extremely hard time to spot enemies unless they move i had the same issue with aa in the end i recognize them thanks to their different weapons and of course their location but some missions are snafu when the friendlies are surrounding a city  cannot distinguish who is who but its alright thats just me sound  great nothing to report here there is ingame music sometimes which gives a bad vibe like we are in a moviecod game sht i just dont like that that is all up to 128 sonds sources at the same time i like that and you can disable music  spacialization works very well with my 51 speakers can hear stuff behind without problem conslusions i recommend the game still i can feel the amazing amount of details in the game it is polished and this is great the huge flaw here is the simulation part that fails hard i am playing almost a cod clone not an improved arma 2 sorry for this reason the free pass didnt convinced me at all i enjoyed playing but i really wasnt afraid of dying nor was i afraid of bad tactics aint nobody got time fo dat too fast is my final conclusion i creep in the dirt i dont run like a crazy monkey on a road you know i will buy the game but much later when the price will have dropped even more right now is around 22 and its on 50% sale still too much for me for what i was expecting if you are looking for a better realistic army infantry simulation then americas army 2 is still the best out there aa3 is good too but is more frenetic like arma3 is compared to arma2

a true successor to arma 2 this is what a sequel looks like rest of the gaming industry not the same thing with a couple of improvements or twists that could have easily been patched in or sold as an expansion bohemia interactive have shown that they are really dedicated to their craft and that they really listen to the community and what they want if only there were more developers like these along with valve and other notable examples improved physics graphics mechanics fantastic soundtrack modding support mission editor this is the military sim to rule all military sims and it feels a damn sight more snappy than its predecessor too which really tickled me gleefully of course it still has a few optimization issues but it is certainly an improvement over previous titles even if you dont like what the vanilla game has to offer there are many dedicated modders out there creating new and free content for you to enjoy and so are the developers this is by no means a perfect game im not sure those exist but its a damn sight better than what most aaa games developers churn out these days im looking at you diceea and activision

this is a really great game this is not a game for people who are going for a call of duty style gameplay there are some bugs but the developers are usually good at finding and fixing them cool dlcs are released frequently the physics are quite nice no unrealistic ragdoll effects when you die nice vehicle handling just dont fall down the stairs or else you wil die haha they do need to fix that the campaign is a thrilling story of a young corporal kerry who youll play as the maps are extremely detailed everywhere there are so many cool and breathtaking areas of the two islands of stratis and altis there are tons of servers and gamemodes so you cant be bored there is also the option to mod this game in so many cool and fantastic ways it seems endless but be warned the controls are not so easy they are not your simple stand crouch prone the vehicles controlling is decent but you will likely need some practice for the jets and helicopters which i had to do the ais pathtaking and combat skills are impressive at times they can act stupid this game is a musthave for the computer gamer i give this game a solid 5 out of 5 stars for its gameplay i would recommend this game to anyone interested in a next level military simulation game the developers team is bunch of people who really do know what they are doing to make this game outstanding to play this is not a game where you might think of a bunch of kids acting like they are united states navy seals or british sas you should think this game as a serious fun educational game of how military might work and fight in a simulated warzone i hope this review encourages you to buy the game and the dlc for it i know i will be a constant customer with the amount of great work the developers have done to arma 3

arma iii has been valued at $60 4958 for over two years now and heres why if you are a fan of fps or tps games you have probably been playing cod cs or bf ten hours a day but arma iii is not a fps or tps games its a military simulator unlike cod cs or bf arma iii is meant to simulate war making it very realistic which means its very hard to get any kills when you first start out and unlike in cod cs or bf arma iii is set in a huge sandbox map meaning no invisible walls almost everything is accesible and snipers are everywhere  in order to enjoy arma iii you have to like very slow paced shooters and have a enormus amount of patience you also must be ready to be killed by that level two sniper hiding in the bushes 1000 ft 304 meters away even though i said it is very slow paced when you do happen to land yourself in a firefight it is heart racing and very intense in order for you to capture a objective in arma iii you have to do these five things a get a group of 1015 people together b carefully plan out minute by minute whats going to happen where it is gonna happen who its gonna happen to and why its gonna happen c aquire transportation to the objective and exit your vehicle about 500 ft 152 meters away from the obective d approach with caution because you have no clue where their security is e excute with full pride and confidence pro tip always be sure to keep in communication with your team and use a compass to give cordinantes on an enemy arma iii is a beatiful game which means it has some heavy system requirments i run it on an alienware m17 and still get an occasional lag spike arma iii is not for everyone or everyones computer but for those who can run it and enjoy this type of shooter it deserves a 9510 because of high system requirments i took off half a point which is why its 95 not 10

this game is a rollercoaster theres parts you will really enjoy then theres parts you wont enjoy this is a war simulator not like any cod or bf game you would get what it means is it involves a lot of running traveling and it may require a lot of patience it is almost 90 % traveling and what it does is it makes the 10 % worth it because when you have traveled or ran for a long long time then you wont really be prepered for combat too much even though its almost just a walkingrunning sim or just a waiting sim when something really does happen you wont be prepered too much and that makes it really thrilling not only wont you be as prepered as if you had ran for 40 ft and then gotten shot at killed them ran another 40 ft and getting shot at theres even a pretty good single player you can play for hours the most popular thing i would assume is the multiplayer and that is because a the single player is mostly scripted and you can go through it over and over and know what to expect while multiplayer is diffrent because you can walk somewhere get killed one time walk to the same place get killed again then walk there again and not get killed its not actually like that sometimes its a game that has a big focus on strategy teamwork and resourses would i recommend this game yes thats just my formal opinion this is a game you will most likely either love or hate before you decide get more into the game because its not just all of the same its one of those unike games you are likely to rarely see

read this before you buy the game because youre about to step into a massively new world arma 3 was such a big leap since arma 2 and left many arma players shocked including me with new weapons vehicles infantry drones maps and more leaves you with a brand new world to explore now that you can swim you have a wider access to the new maps unlike arma 2 you will actually enjoy swimming in the ocean there is much more to talk about but its too much to explain one word before i go amazing

to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as i swoop in from the west to flank them yet before we can regroup my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north and the british still need more time to complete their mission alone i rush to the southernmost tip of the island where i blow up a fortified antiair position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point where the boat takes me home arguably the biggest complaint about bohemia interactives postflashpoint games is that their campaigns havent used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential the first armas campaign was a hastily cobbledtogether disappointment while it took a certain zombiesurvival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of arma 2s chernarus that arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twentyodd missions is indicative of bohemias effort to resolve this ongoing issue indeed taken as a whole arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive more engaging and more userfriendly experience it isnt completely successful but i had an awful lot of fun watching it try while arma 3 was officially released back in september the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months each chapter is a selfcontained entity with its own story arc and theme combined they tell the tale of the excitingly named corporal ben kerry and his role in the war over the fictional mediterranean island archipelago of altis and stratis waged between four different factions the first part survive is geared towards introducing players to arma it takes place entirely on the smaller of arma 3s two islands stratis and sees kerry banding up with a group of nato survivors after the local altian armed forces backed by natos eastern equivalent csat rise up against the local us garrison for the most part missions are smallscale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the follower category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings its hardly the campaigns most spectacular stage storywise its let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another even here though bohemias approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent missions are nearly always multistaged with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan while it smoulders rather than sparks survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into adapt definitely the best of the three chapters this introduces altis a masterwork of environmental design i could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds its misty dawns crimson dusks and streetlightspeckled nights but whats most important is how the detail thats gone into mapping the landscapes undulations  the lumps and bumps hills and valleys  plays into the games combat a little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy ai when they stop to reload youll rush to locate a better vantage point order your men to find cover an extremely handy new command and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponents surprisingly tough body tactics are vital in arma 3 but its terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure its crucial to learn this before adapt begins because the difficulty suddenly ramps up the first mission sees you alone unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety at this point setting saves to unlimited using armas highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity fittingly after survive you will die many many times that said its important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations smoother weapon handling and better optics  meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slowtoaim weapons adapt also changes the way you play it gives you a squad to control which is a mixed blessing ai units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and apcs but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive and the lack of changes to armas squad commands means this can be a chore especially problematic is ai ammo management your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in arma 3s clumsy interface alongside its story missions which include the brilliant raid on stratis described above adapt also introduces an openworld component from your base you can go out on patrol and complete multiple optional objectives from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex all while collecting weapons ammo and equipment to use during the main missions  though the clunkiness of armas inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be if you want to bring stuff back to base you need to find a vehicle and load it itembyitem from your own inventory while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process after the meatiness of adapt the final chapter win feels fleeting by comparison with only six missions to its name but theyre also the most spectacular displaying vast combinedarms battles that cover sweeping areas of altis its strongly reminiscent of the opening of operation flashpoint but with you in control rather than being led by an ai squad leader in these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things storywise its also the most interesting segment making unsettling use of its nearfuture setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating whichever direction you take arma 3s campaign is a big powerful deeply engrossing thing but there is one disappointment its lack of vehicular missions since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt there are no tank missions no helicopter missions and no jet missions i can understand why to a point armas vehicles especially its airborne offering take time and effort to learn to control moreover in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway on the other hand flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue and its frustrating that 13 years on armas campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience 810

arma 3 is a very special game the realism that is blended with the game really brings the game to life the maps in the game are extremely huge allowing for people to roam and have great battles the gamemodes associated with arma 3 show what fun can be had battle royale is among my favorites where the game is a hungergameslike survival competition there is a variety of vehicles including aerial and sea the weapons have many attachments and some have the unique trait to have tracers overall the game is a thrilling experience 910

this game have the best realism where you can easily die by bullets high recoil and no terms of onemanarmy like most of the game these days its possible to be oma but that requires many tries on each levels the bad thing is that the gameplay is kind of boring because theres too many information that you recieved but less thing you can do instructionsguide while in game sometimes doesnt help a new player to understand this game too many button to use the ai in singleplayer kindda dumb the ai doesnt react to our command smart enough realism  9010 gameplay  5510 ai  3510 graphics  8510 physics  7510 overall  6810

one of the better games if not the best on my list in which you have complete and absolute freedom the editor itself is a very fun feature and you can do practically whatever as long as you dedicate some time to learning how to script or the syntax or whatever in any case an amazing game which i truly enjoy playing with others cooperatively but also pvp the combat is fun somewhat simple but surely adrenalinepumping and full of action if youre playing with the right people its a relaxing beautiful experience which helps teambuilding teamwork leadership and orientation quite a bit the new features stances are amazing holding control and pressing was or d acts responsively and puts you into a certain stance the controls are easy to learn flying isnt all that difficult if you have some patience and the nimbleness to use autohover armoured vehicles for now contain only armoured personnel carriers but therell be main battle tanks soon which is amazing the names are altered but you might recognize how the zamak trucks are actually kamaz trucks the more you know anyhow the aircraft helicopters for now are amazing and perform quite well my favourite i dont have one for now but onto the weapons which i find sauce weapons are highly customizeable and allow for dynamic attachments and replacing the aforementioned stealth operation slam a suppressor on longrange no problem heres a scope and it all goes together very well but the content is still lacking however its a beta and i cant wait for the actual release of the game which will be amazing as the beta is saucetastic as it is to anyone who wants to explore a mediterraneanesque island i truly suggest purchasing this game and going crazy as i said you have a lot of options the editor itself you can craft campaigns in that thing as stupid as it seems it can be something better than singleplayermultiplayer combined its all down to you and how you wish to play it out you could even try roleplay servers and be a civilian but thats not what this is about this is warfare 1010

first of all arma is not a shooter like cod or bf the pace style of gameplay maps are really different but i have to say that it is more enjoyable funny and communicating with the other players is great for example being the gunner of a tank there are numbers that tell you direction and distance so other player inside the tank tells you the indications to shoot you wont be able to find this anywhere else or being in a squad splitting in pairs to clear some buildings while the other 2 players cover you it is important to make clear that you buy arma for its multiplayer and coop mode if you are looking for campaign game dont buy this also if you are planning to buy this game i have to tell you that you will have to join a clan to enjoy this game to its maximum otherwise by yourself you wont like it as much s joining a clan means you will have to download mods content created by the community and probably teamspeak program similar to skype to play with them all clans ask for a mic take that into account to sum it up arma is a total unique in the experience out in the market regarding fps nonetheless to have a good time you need to join a clan and play with other people and be willing to download new content

been here since first arma ive seen huge improvements and still a long way to go arma 3 is way better than arma 2 the alpha version itself has fewer bugs than the released version of arma 2  but that doesnt mean it is bug free i play it in a realism unit and we use the game extensively trying to get 100% of what the game can offer either using zeus or other mods to improve the experience the scenario depicts an unstable region currently constituted by two greek islands located to the south of the balkanic peninsula on the aegean sea the first one is stratis agios efstratios  httpswwwgooglecommaps@39512281925013901113z and the second one is altis lemnos  httpswwwgooglecommaps@3990239652522632626328m bohemian crew actually went to those islands and took pictures of the towns located there so the ingame cities looks almost exactly the same as the real cities just like kavala in altis that looks very much the town of limnos httpyoutubee5urndaogpa there are four factions struggling for power in this region they are nato north atlantic treaty organization csat canton protocol strategic alliance treaty aaf altis armed forces and fia freedom and independence army in all missions the game depicts csat as an invading force and nato as the peacekeeping force aaf and fia are local forces and their allignment varies along the missions the game still has some latency issues lagspikes dedicated server crashes frequently the framerate is extremely low tops 25 even using the standard settings over a highend rig the learning curve is very steep if you didnt play the previous titles from the franchise but once you get things going it is some unique fps experience that no other game can give you and ive played enough of them to know about that be aware if youre willing to hop in a server grab your gear walk 10 steps and start killing people this game is not for you this is a complete combat simulation suite focused on realism which means that usually if you spawn too close to action youll die and youll never know where from if you fly your helicopter too close to the objective youll probably be shot down if you drive your hunter directly inside a hostile city youll probably gonna blow from land mines or at soldiers be ready to drive cars or pilot aircraft for 10 minutes then park the vehicles and walk for 5 more minutes prior to hope for any action at all it is a great game and if you are a fan of simulation and combat genres this is the perfect mix of both for some footage check out my youtube channel httpswwwyoutubecomuserpfcvalls

i do really recomend the game but the game is meant to be $50 i was looking at the arma website and converted it to usd and it said it was around $50 so would i say its a ripoff no but i do think that steam should lower the amount this game is worth it but steam just needs to look at that because i was playing the free weekend and it should have been like $25 dollars i at that time had $20 so maybe we should ask steam to make a free full edition weekend where you could download it and keep it after the weekend finished

arma 3 is a good successor to arma2 with some great improvements to the engine visuals vehicles etc mainly i have played the wasteland king of the hill and epoch alpha mods king of the hill being the most rewarding and enjoyable over all i have only just dipped my toes into the campaign however i will be doing more of it i think with all the improvements to arma youll still get those good ole arma moments like clipping through wallsfloors and your vehicle exploding on contact with a weed or bush

best game for multiple reasons the singleplayer is actually good which i did not imagine the variety of multiplayer servers and game mode is amazing and can do so much like role playing taking over an objective and some other stuff the differences between this and arma 3 is so different like scuba diving gear and  anyway overall i think you should get this game if you are debating it but you may need a good rig to run it

this game is very fun and open and alot of things to do the singleplayer is very amazing with the stunning graphics and visuals the audio is somewhat clear but i can understand people clearly in chat and i can hear gunshots and explosions from a long distances and it is very cool the multiplayer side is amazing and playing from the combat simulation with others to the altis life rpg addon and to the epic zombie survival mod of dayz to surviving and fighting in the world of wasteland last but not least the editor for arma 3 is very good but very advanced to understand right away just get used to the basic things of editing until you can create large scale battles with the editor this game is not for the regular fps players this game is way more intense in my opinion than call of duty or battlefield you actually have to plan and use tactics to get the job done and the maps are very large and you cant run forever so at first it might be irritating for new players but you will get used to it very fun military simulator and it is very addicting this game is a thumbs up d 1210

this game is one of the best military sandboxes i have ever played you can fly a jet drive a tank and  things up you can even fight in you underware 1010

ok first off holy crap this game is sweet if you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les i got mine for 30 i think i would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist a great game thats lots of fun you can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just  around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up if you liked dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating but over all 1010 would buy again seriously if your pc can handle it get it

this is a combat simulation not a fps with that in mind this game focuses on warcombat as a complete package as opposed to something like battlefront a classis fps where you are shootingfighting constantly here you may never even fire a shot on a given mission i personally fire very rarely you will spend time in transit tofrom multiple objectives sometimes this will be in a helicopter sometimes a truck sometimes on foot while there you may spend literally hours stalkingsneaking to avoid detection by groups of enemies that can kill you with a single shot yup just one you can also drive a simply jawdroppingly wide range of vehicles and equipment you can pilotride in everything from fighter jets to tanks to cars top speed boats to even a mini submarine the game is also extremely extensible meaning that it is very easy to mod in almost any way you can imagine while installing some larger mods may take some basic computer knowledge find a folder put a certain file in that folder then specially edit another file that sort of thing many addons are as simple as visiting the steam workshop ingame and subscribing to new content everything else is automatic from there who will like it people who like depth and details you like to plan every aspect of your approach to get the best possible advantage you like working together with other players many missions are coop against a deadly ai who should pass this up people who like constant violent action while there are definitely times when you seem to be constantly embattled this doesnt happen very often

the game is amazing it brings out all of our good aspects teamwork coordination patience and gives us hours of entertainment you can play a custom mission by yourself or with your friends you can even play with people from across the world and make new friends i would highly recommend buying this game if you havent already got it

i have to admit i was hating this game in the beginning i couldnt understand why i kept dying i couldnt get the controls down and everything felt way to complicated then a few weeks ago i decided to sit down and learn the game as other reviewers stated this game is not call of duty or battlefield you have to be patient you have to learn the weapons and vehicles this game is worth every penny as long as you invest a few days to learn the controls add in steam workshop and other mods breaking point is my favorite and you have a fantastic war simulator

arma ii was one of my favorite games and it still is but arma iii is just in a testing alpha version and they upgraded everything which was bad in arma ii better physics ragdolls animations and they even added cool new things such as weapon modifications uniforms first aid kits and underwater life the only bad things are bad optimization and the funny animations when youre climbing a ladder i dont know why they left that in there unchanged it was funny as hell back in arma ii there are some mods for it already and the game doesnt have even a month so the modding community will be big like it was for arma ii i think theres even a sandbox zombie mod d i really love the graphics this is the most photorealistic game you can get crysis 3 has unrealistic lights audio effects are cool too but not as cool as in battlefield 3 for example gameplay is almost the same as in arma ii but there are some new things like your characters stances i was messing with the editor for like 5 hours in a row and i did some interesting things the editor has a new look but works exactly like in the previous game i think arma iii will be ever more successful than its predecessor and im proud of our czech brothers for such an amazing game my recension will change with the upcoming beta version overall 1010

arma three fits into the modern fps category very poorly its not a bad game its just not cod a better category would be tfps tactical first person shooter cause thats what it is its also a very fun and challenging game
recommended
i loved still love arma 2 co and arma 3 is a brilliant successor theyve added a lot of polish to the game made movement feel much smoother and really improved the graphics with steam workshop new content for the game is just a click away and there are some excellent usermade missions out there moreover there are a ton of mods available which can change various aspects of the game ive put more than 400 hours into arma 3 playing and creating missions and thats just in singleplayer i cant recommend the game enough to anyone who likes realistic openworld shooters itll be installed on my pc for a long long time
recommended
great gameplay great visuals sounds and the two new islands are frankly wonderful and huge in my opinion the most noticeable improvement since arma 2 is that we are now evolving into some realistic and visually credible open world as opposed to the narrow places kinda looking like more or less similar checkpoints in previous games the gameplay adjusts extremely well to the new terrains making arma 3 something closer to an actual simulation than just an advanced fps with milsim elements into it however it is impossible to talk honestly about arma 3 without telling what hurts most the lack of vehicles planes notably but not only the lack of weapons and few annoying ai pathfinding issues sometimes even on places where all should normally go well that being said i personally can see an insanely great potential behind arma 3 and the way it will continue to evolve will in my opinion probably make it simply one of the best game ever created all it needs is some more time to grow up
recommended
definitely the best military combat simulator to date  simply a true simulation of combat the pros complete combat simulationphysics taken in account at every bulletvery realistic movement system and an extremely realistic commanding system missionscenario editormake every imaginary scenario real in the huge sandbox that is arma iiiwhich means that you get all the tools and the ability to make missions by yourself and play them afterwardsis it pitting 100 jets of bluforfriends against 100 jets of opforenemies and watching them fight it out as a civilian caught in crossfire or right in the action as a soldieror just spawning a vehicle and exploring the huge sandbox  yeah you can do anything  huge sandboxand when i say huge i mean hugeextreme probably one of the biggest in gaming steam workshop  simply the ability to upload your realistic or crazy missions online for others to shareor download masterpieces by scenario artists of arma maturerealistic and engaging multiplayer  no whiny 10 year oldsthis is the real dealan engaged community with a lot of experience in the game and wellbuilt servers the cons very heavy for your system  even with a high end system it will still flinch a bit on very high settingsits the price you pay for the huge sandboxbut its worth it  lack of content at the momentyes at the moment you are given the huge sandbox but barely half of the stuff you had in arma ii to play aroundthis involves player modelsgunsvehicles etcthough as the game goes on the developers add content periodically so no worriesthough do not expect it fastpatience over all  its a hard game to get into and it targets certain audienceswhat do i mean  well the game is overall complex so if youre looking for a game to quickly jump into arma iii or any arma in this context is not suitableit requires enough of your timenext if youre looking for an alternative to games like battlefieldcod etcyoure looking at the wrong gamethis is not your generic fps this is a military simulation verdict at the moment my rating is 810a good game but feels prematurely released with the lack of content  also not for the generic usergamerand not for the owner of a mediocre or weak pc
recommended
improves a lot from the previous games but lacks certain key improvements to really set it apart from arma 2 like a redesigned addaction system and multiplayer performance still a great game in its modding infancy in a few months there will be some great addons
recommended
realistic warfare to a whole different scale is armas specialty giving players the unique experience to play simulated firefights between either pvp or pve for the most part arma 3 has a good community most people communicate with their teams to lead them into cities complete objectives or simply talking to a pilot to let them know where to drop you off i do not recommend trying to play as a cod player in this trying to use a sniper in a city or trying to quickscope youd probably die really fast anyway there were only some problems with arma 3 such as minor bugs that are not that noticible rare or major bugs that havent been fixed yet also some players seem to take this game a little too seriously ive seen many players who havent played the arma series and wanting to try to use vehicles for the first time some players dont allow them as obviously being a beginner theyre not good or wasting precious vehicles that could have been useful overall its a great game but dont take it too seriously and just remember its a game not real life graphics 9810 sound 8510 gameplay 9710 community 7510 overall 8910

this is the tactical shooter if youre tired of the often trite and rediculous military shooters out there and want a more realistic simulation of military endevour give this game a try not for the faint of heart or the incautious its by far the best military fps experience ive had to date that is not to say it isnt without its faults or problems touch on those in later on but the overall experience the sense of scale and the frankly the amount of fun ive had in this game are what make this game my goto for tactical combat pros  scale of the environment youre not going to find anything remotely like this in scale save possibly in wwii online which is comparitively more dated than this the enviornments are huge even on stratis it takes considerable time to simply walk from one location to another both maps offer a good variety of cover concealment and terrain to fight in from forested hills and mountains to underwater stealthy goodness  realism what i mean by this is that the game provides fairly realistic expectations on human limitations such as the amount and types of gear one can carry fatigue and the surprising turns of fragility and endurance of the human body marksmanship is important and vigilance is key in firefights its easy for the unwary to lose track of a target if you dont keep your eyes peeled and your rifle ready creating a sense of tension in combat unlike most any other ive experienced there are swells and lulls to it that speak to an environment that lends itself to a more realistic combat experience  its pretty while not the top tier of graphics this is certainly an accessible and sometimes stunning gaming experience it takes a poet to describe the sweeping vistas that reveal themselves at the oddest moments with your intense focus on the environment around you you can be trekking to an objective location in multiplayer with some friends and crest a hill to see a marvellous mediterranean sunset over a quiet seaside village and theres a poignancy when that serenity is broken by an artillery barrage from the forward observer on the opposite hill the character models can be customised in a way previous titles of this series could not giving voice to the inner tactical fashionista really sometimes dressing in allblack gear just feels good  modding support mod support for this game is building slowly but surely and for a few of my gripes in the cons section there are mods that help alleviate the suffering somewhat as a niether here nor there sort of observation the game interface is much improved over previous versions of the game especially the inventory system which is a marvelous improvement compared to the frustration generated from the previous title however its not perfect and especially the contextual menu needs some major tweaking and reexamination by bi cons  optimization the game could do with some settings i can use on most games with comprable graphics simply do not hold up in arma iii but its rarely crippling i still wish itd be less of a struggle to have settings on a level that makes the game as pretty as it is without a lagging frame rate  lack of choice this applies more to gear and weapons than anything while the stable of available gear for use has been increasing gradually since the alpha supporter edition theres still a surprisingly low number of choices for small arms and vehicles in particular im hoping that the campaign extensions will also continue to provide more variety to the ingame gear i have to choose from  dinky guns its a bit of a pet peeve ill admit that some of the weapons feel weirdly underpowered in this perhaps its simply because im less used to using them but a few weapons take more than half a magazine at short range to bring down relatively lightly armored foes with well placed shots im looking at you smgs and 556 weapons
recommended
very realistic game spot on combat vehicular and weapon mechanics my complaint only complaint can only be related to possible crappy servers i have got on or my own addbut either way sometimes it feels like gameplay can drag on without anything happening for an overwhelmingly extended period of time overall 810 in my mind if you are super into realism in war games definite 1010

arma 3 is a good game and all that stuff but it the most glitchy and laggy gameplay in any game one of the glitches is not getting into a vehicle but nonstop searching it for weapons so i had to give up a helicopter for that glitch unless if you want to be realy mad at how you die in about 2 shots and have to giveup vehicles do to glitches thats fine but im sure nobody wants to die in 2 shots and loose about a hour of work getting guns then dieing from thirst or teamkillers  hackers
recommended
great game
recommended
i highly recommend arma 3 if youre into army games with a high sense of realism you can make this game as awesome as you want yourself depending on which modded gamemodes you play or with who youre playing im part of one of the largest arma 3 clans out there joint task force 2 and it really adds to the experience having a tactical realism based clan think of stuff like basic training military rank structure working with a chain of command teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc check us out over at wwwjointtaskforce2com
recommended
highly polished arma ii with future weapons new shooting stances and vast detailed maps like its predecessor the mod community makes for a highly customizable game experience now backed by steam workshop warning some dedicated fan boys of the arma franchise would claim this is a very smooth game i feel while smoother than arma ii its still a far cry from being entirely smoothed out the most popular game mode seems to be wasteland which is dayz with out zombies as you can imagine new players often get camped and ed prior to even finding a weapon supposedely you can port arma ii objects into arma iii i have not tested this yet but that proves to be some what promising for custom map design
recommended
this is war
recommended
great game if you are interested in having a dayz like experience i would recommend downloading the breaking point mod
recommended
pretty chilled brah

excellent sandbox simulation but unlike others i will not say it is a total military simulation vehicles and aircraft and their controls pathfinding etc need vast improvement for this to even be considered a survey sim however arma 3 is an excellent infantry simulator and the vehicles and aircraft used as a supporting cast are sufficient thrown in the community mods game modes and missions and nothing can beat arma 3 i just wish the grass was not so cheesy looking when you crawl though it and the graphics were a bit more cinematic i guess one cannot have everything

best shooter since well arma2 make sure you try its wasteland mod specifically samatras wasteland the only legit version of it arguably arma2s version of wasteland is better but arma3 is the future pros realism cons not enough realism sci fi elements
recommended
the scale of this game is absolutely epic and like nothing else ive played the game engine is a great improvement over arma 2 and looks every bit as good as battlefield 3 & 4 graphics but where this game really shines is its modding support online mods like the day z and wasteland mods are such great fun and there are moments where youre creeping through the woods or in valleys in the dark at night and you just feel this uneasy tension that you never know whose sights you could be in i was a longtime fan of the battelfield series but the dlc whoring has completely disenfranchised me from the series it came to a point where any time i just wanted a quick game with friends i was forced to download stealth dlc that i was never going to purchase and it stealing valuable hdd space therefore preventing me from playing at all even when 3 of us did have the latest patch 3 of us couldnt play anything but vanilla due to the fact we all had different dlc arma3 has been a breath of fresh air to me with loads of content available from the modding community i may even start modding this game myself because they have provided modding tools and actually support the modding community and listen to their concerns and address things that need fixing unlike other we know better and are not interested game companies  i cant wait to see what awesome mods will come in the next few months

crazy developerwhat about making an open world based simulation shooter with good graphics many weapons and really interesting vehicles but since it has to be something special so lets set in the the future and maybe add something like like diving and flying jets and using uavs and using artillery tanks and much more but since 300h playtime is not enough for us lets add full mod compatibility and a built in editor programmersyes lets do this and well this is arma 3 a mod compatible first person shooter set in the future with an open world and many ways to solve a multiplayer mission diving no problem sniping no problem driving in fullham using tanks no problem in other words arma 3 is a sandbox a shootersandbox you like zombie games just download and play the breaking point mod you like rpg with soldiers civilians and even suicide bombers then join an rpg server you like the vanilla gameplay of tactical shooters join a vanilla server yould like some modded gameplay with lets say 20 30 well no >50 modded weapons then go ahead download mods and join a server using the same mods but there is one thing which may turn down some xxxcodfanboyz the realism you got shot in the lag oh you wont be able to run that long anymore but realism doesnt mean that the game is impossibly hard it just means that you have to play as a team while using tactics the main problem of the whole game is the optimization while pvponly servers work pretty well on my normal pc with about 3040 frames servers having many ais will make every pc die the frames will drop to 1020 even if you dont see the many ai soldiers running around still go ahead and buy this game every teamplayer who got bored from battlefield of duty medal of modern warfare and 0815  will enjoy this game

this game is one of the best simulators i have ever played it contains many improvements to the engine graphics and controls since arma 2 this game has been made better by the steam workshop to host a ton of downloadable senarios i would recommend you play this game with friends or some sort of community some negatives of this game is its performance i requires a powerful computer to play even then there is some sort of performace drop also there was a lack of single player content but there is now some being released im looking forward to the future of this game as it gains popularity and plus with all the cool expansions arma 2 had there will probably be new content in the future one more thing is that there is a huge difficulty spike because its a simulator this is no call of duty or battle field and requires alot of time to get used to if you never had any experience with arma games and you are not shure if you should get arma 3 buy arma 2  oa it has been on sale recently for really cheap
recommended
best shooter i have ever played its not like other fps games less arcade style and leans more towards realism but aside from that the world of arma is just simple amazing and beautiful very well made terrain and citiestowns you can lose your self just wandering around

to be honest like all previous bohemia games arma 3 is filled with all sorts of bugs and unfinished  half complete stuff  however there is something unique about this game  something special that keeps people playing this game graphics  gameplay campaign are pretty good even though they could be allot better even though there are other military sims that are not bad at all  arma titles hold the very top  why you may ask  its because arma 3 provides the user with the tools to create whatever he wants you finished the campaign  no problem  here are hundreds of user created missions for you that you can now play you dont like the missions  no problem  here is the editor in which you can make ur own missions you dont like the arma 3 factionsweaponsvehicles visual fxsoundairealism  no problem  here  download the hundreds of mods available for free you want to create ur own content  here are the modding tools  you can do  create whatever you want with them and this is what makes arma 3 special i am sure bright future awaits this game if the devs listen to the community and the community stays loyal to this gamerecommended
recommended
i really like this game it is so fun the editor mode is really fun to play around with making your own scenerios or just having a massive war for the hell of it so to the creators i say arigato

one of the only game where i spent more time on the graphic settings for optimal 60fps and training in the tutorial than actually playing the game aside that the control are smoother than arma 2 and feels more optimized but the content is still lacking it become a great game if one get invested in it otherwise pass your way if you expect playing it like a regular fps with wasd and left click youll become a machinist on your keyboard
recommended
arma 3 the game is good still not as good as arma 2 imo more content in arma 2 then what it is in arma 3 but the modding community fixes that to like 100% adding more guns and armies and now that bohemia is adding karts into the game after a april joke thing and then adds it as a pay dlc sure the money goes to charity but why need some karts when are the dlcs that acctualy are usefull like in arma 2 where dlcs added more armies and units czech republic dlc and brit dlc those where good dlcs now we get sniper dlc helicopter dlc kart dlc like what but yea the game is good overall even though the server browser is compleatly empty with servers and sinse zeus came out i though there was going to be tons of servers running it but nah not a single server is running it so use zeus in sp editor much better do i recommend the game yes 710 no servers and  dlcs that have no use

i wanted to love arma 3 so very much its the military game i had been thinking about in my head for years upon years open world freedom huge battles huge armies tearing each other to bits as you either control a tank chopper oir take part in an infantry skirmish however thats exatcly what arma 3 fails to deliver the shooting mechanics are fine as the ballistics the sound it complete trash the guns sounds absolutly awfull it will certainly be worth your time downloading the sound mod for these made by some guy in his bedroom it completly trounces the vannilla sounds of arma 3 in every respect adding a much needed realism in that department bohemia please hire this guy but back to the crux of what is wrong with arma 3 i realise this game is in beta still and the main game campaign is unfinished where is the war every mission in arma 3 be it a user created scenario or the main campaign each mission is just a skirmish a tiny bunch of ai controlled bots versus you and your squad it lacks impact it lacks excitment at no point playing arma 3 was i immersed in what appeared to be a realistic military conflict now this is 2014planetside 2 an online multilayer game manages to have 2000 players on one map in an incredible seesaw conflict for control of the mapits a free to play gamewhy does arma 3 not manage this even in an ai controlled sp warzone let alone a multiplayer arena is it engine limitations why does arma 3 not have a warzone mode alongside its campaign and multiplayer all i want to be is plonked down in a huge island wide conflict able to choose one of many mission objectives and actually feel involved it something organic and dynamic there are a few user created missions that attempt to create this but they fall short something about this game makes it unable to run a huge conflict without causing serious serious clientside lag now ill mention the multiplayerwhat a jokeits so laggy as to be unplayable i dont know why either there is something seriously wrong either with the servers or there is something wrong with the way stuff is optimised and implemented in this game please note arma 3 has been released for a very long time now ok yes its not full release but my god please fix the multiplayer bohemia it makes your company look rediculous dayz sa is in alpha and it manages to run 1000% better multiplayer arenas now my last qualm is the price 60 dollars for something that has an unplayble mulitplayer and an unfinished single player holy @$% my advice is very sadly do not buy this game until full release  and even then make sure it works properly or you may be wasting your money

being a war simulation game in comparison battlefield is an arcade game the community is very mature and respectful besides if you are a programmer you can do a lot with this game

if you get bored of all those codbf clones out there try something new and more real in arma 3 one bullet can be your end at full health how it should be it has far better emersion than any cod bf or cs game ever had
recommended
great game a more adult battlefield 4 good graphics and the best modz ever
recommended
this game is epic if youre a battlefield or cod troll then i suggest you move on to something like sims dont waste your time on campaign mode get yourself onto multiple player find a clan get on ts and trust me you wont look back see you on the battlefield es

really good

game has amazing graphics that is all i need to say
recommended
i built my pc so i could play this game this is the only reason i spent over 500 dollars on a computer this is such an underrated game although this isnt a game for casual gamers only the hardcore gamers will enjoy arma 3 it is by far the best shooter ive played i will be purchasing any dlc for it on the day of the realease
recommended
a good follow up to arma 2 with updated graphics and smoother movements certainly one of my favourite milltary shooterrs out there however i am missing the familiarity of guns that arma 2 had with its massive assortments of weapons and vehicles would definitely like to see more added on to the game on that respect ai are more intelligent maybe too intelligent however with great game types like wasteland and an integrated steam workshop it certainly delivers mods may also add on to the game the same way dayz and ace did for arma 2

call of dutys more educated and respectable older cousin an fps for the thinking man who appreciates the real life brutal realities of combat this game doesnt grab your hand and guide you to its breast this game makes you work for your entertainment treat this game right take the time to understand its nuances and never underestimate its bite and youll have a much more rewarding experience than you can achieve with most fps games when a mission is carried out via your own strategic wit and whim and hours are spent infiltrating and avoiding enemy patrols so that you can make it to that perfect firing position for your sniper it really makes that one shot a lot more heart pounding than any round fired in any other military shooter if you have adhd watch wrestling appeared on jerry springer think call of duty is a good game andor are the offspring of two genetically similar parents you will not enjoy this game
recommended
hardcore military simulator plenty of mods maps and content
recommended
i need a better computer buy this game now

at first i was like pew pew pew pew but now im like  waiting pew

ing great omg xd

i love this game good job who made it
recommended
the vast amount of game modes will keep me entertained for hundreds of hours and ive only played two of them altis life is fun and wasteland mode is some of the most intense fps action ive ever played
recommended
i would not say this game is worth buying at full price but i can tell you that its really fun nonetheless there are a lot of bugs and it feels more like a retextured and updated arma 2 but there are plenty of fun scenarios and multiplayer is very good the game requires a really beefy computer to not run on  graphics so if you have a crappy computer and you dont want to see  graphics then dont get this game however if youre up for an intense milsim then get this game rate 810
recommended
this is by far my favorite sandbox game the base game itself is very good and the multiplayer is a ton of fun though servers do need to be restarted like every 4 hours of the multiplayer lag gets out of hand i would not reccomend this game if you have a lower end to mid end machine as this games graphics will destroy your machine buy this game

arma 3 the thrilling sequel to the arma series featuring an entirely new set of environments weapons vehicles and voices arma 3 brings a unique gameplay experience bound with everything from fps and tps firefights to large scale battles on a grande scale unlike many shooters of its genre arma 3 features realistic bullet and damage characteristics if you get shot in the arm weapon sway increases if your vehicle takes hull damage you are more easily susceptible to bullet damage arma also brings futuristic weapons of modern warfare into the mix the developement team did a good job of mixing modern weapons and giving them a unique futuristic twist arma 3 also brings an unlimited gameplay experience with millions of different missions each different from one another in the gameplay the potential to create play and enjoy missions is endless incredible for team building and communication building arma 3 gives everyone from recreational players to strict military based players to have an enjoyable and realistic experience

1010 best game in a while haha just because
recommended
arma 3 is like its predecessors when bohemia launched it i mean after alpha and beta phase it was still incomplete lacking content for example i mean the biggest island ever and only one jet for a minor fraction the aaf and bug riddled so nothing changed behemia is still greedy and the community has to bring it arround wich it does missions mods everything is comming from you guys thanks for that
recommended
epic everyone should own this game

recommended
this game is amazing but does have its moments online coop like getting shot through walls but this game is well worth the money even though its in alpha its has so much to offer for the engine platform it uses is amazing the graphics are outstanding for multiplayer over all i would give the game a 7 out of 10 on campaign and a 10 out of 10 on multiplayer just because the campaign is kinda hard in the beginning of it the multiplayer you have a good community of players on the coop i just love it i will keep playing this game until bohemia interactive comes out with arma 4 if they do it will be hard to top this game and the cooperation of other players they just need to add more stuff but its still in alpha
recommended
im not sure wether i should recommend it or not but its enjoyable so i will the game was released unfinished there were close to nothing to do in the game because of the lack of content theres 2 factions in blufor i think and one in opfor one in independent unless im mistaken theres no weapon variation theres like 2 weapons per faction if even only independent have jets and its just one jet with another variant of it the lack of content is what completely ruins this game the combat however is very smooth unless your fps is on 20 which it usually is unless you have an absolutely extreme gaming computer wellmade and convenient theres 9 stances you can take high stand normal stand crouching stand high crouch normal crouch low crouch sitting while firing lying down and lying on the side theres also a combat pace and a running pace which is great in the combat pace you run slower with your weapon up so you dont have to walk to fire like you did in arma 2 i love the game for its mechanics which are much much more smoother than arma 2 but i always play arma 2 more because of how incredibly much content there is for it especially with ace the graphics are awesome aswell the lightning the textures and effects are amazing but theyll most likely drop your fps drastically not sure if its due to bad optimization or if its because the maps are so huge and detailed also altis the main map of the game ive noticed is very popular and everyone talks about how its 270km2 or something like that but travelling from one side of the map to the other is only 20km and takes like 2 minutes by chopper which was kind of dissapointing its still a great map though with alot of nice places and things to do to summarize this game is really wellmade and cool but when it comes to content and features arma 2 beats it by far
recommended
one of the best military sims out there if you like immersionsandbox then you will love this
recommended
i absolutely love arma 3 and would in every way recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest there are somewhat valid criticisms of it which i will get out of the way right away before getting into why the pros by far outweigh the cons 1 lack of content  one of the more popular criticisms of this game is the lack of official content in the current build especially compared to the amount of content in arma 2 the two main factions currently at the time of writing this review have no fixed wing aircraft armoured vehicles of different factions have the same turrets and weapons merely reskinned artillery antiair and remote controlled turrets on smaller vehicles and uavsugvs are identical for all factions except for different camo patterns 2 performance  another often heard criticism of arma 3 is that it performs very poorly on some machines that it often should perform well on like machines with topend graphics cards and powerful cpus addressing these points one by one i will say that while there is content missing that even i would have expected the game to have at release it isnt a whole lot arma 2 did not have all the content it does today at its release either and much of it is inflated by there being separate entries for guns with different attachment combinations so that the same gun with four different sight attachments would show up in a list as four different guns as for the performance issues the game runs perfectly fine on my middleoftheroad gaming rig and runs at playable rates on the old low to midend machine of my best friend the performance of the game on some peoples highend machines is in no way a sure indicator of bad optimization especially when the same game runs great on other machines with the same hardware now getting to the real meat of the review the visuals of this game are amazing especially if you have the power to crank up the graphics settings the lighting is great and makes the game look heavenly especially at night the texture quality is top notch especially for foliage and i fully believe anyone interested in first person shooters should experience one where you can freely roam a huge 270 square kilometer beautifully rendered island with a rendering distance of several kilometers other cool graphical features are the volumetric fog and clouds as well as rain that is rendered as independent particle effects for each raindrop in stead of a mere filter or overlay audiowise the game could do with some improvements that are guaranteed to happen over time if not by bohemia interactive then by community modders however overall the sound design of this game is really quite good as it is the gameplay is where arma 3 really shines over its predecessor as controls of your soldier have been improved to feel a lot more direct and fluid than in previous games though the action menu still tends to limits how good the game can feel in certain situations the inventory system has seen huge improvements from arma 2 and is much more streamlined without sacrificing flexibility vehicles are now physics simulated objects which is a huge improvement over arma 2s incredibly janky vehicle physics underwater gameplay is a really nice addition that looks amazing and gives mission makers a lot more freedom and variety to work with when making missions and giving the players different approaches to completing them firing weapons in arma 3 feel pretty damn good as most rifles have a good deal of kick to them making them both sound and feel powerful in stead of feeling like call of duty or battlefield style bullethoses different weapon calibers penetrating diferent materials differently at different angles and distances gives both the shooters and the people being shot at a lot of things to think about and decide how to react to in every firefight which is great in a game that is so decidedly slow paced as arma is compared to other first person shooters if you get this game and want to dive straight into some fun arma 3 gameplay i suggest playing though the first episode of the singleplayer campaign first to get acquainted with the fairly complex controls and spottingshooting enemies at ranges that other fps games would never expect you to once you feel somewhat at home in the game i highly recommend looking for a multiplayer server running the wasteland mission which is sort of like a 3way team deathmatch gamemode with survival elements basebuilding resource gathering and impromptu minimissions against ai that all of the three teams are given and can undertake at the same time each team trying to beat the others for the promised reward leading to some very interesting clashes so all in all i can barely recommend this game enough but to get some real enjoyment out of it youll want to run it on a decent mid to highend rig

the overall experience you get from arma games is good but bugs are to be expected the game feels like an actual war simulator one shot can either kill or hurt badly medkits are must have and the missions are a fun experience the game is reccomended when you have a couple of friends with you it gets dull and boring if you are alone like any other game but with friends the whole satisfaction is improved
recommended
the latest edition of the best military simulator series has a steep learning curve and requires an uptodate machine to run though
recommended
arma 3 is a good successor to arma2 with some great improvements to the engine visuals vehicles etc mainly i have played the wasteland king of the hill and epoch alpha mods king of the hill being the most rewarding and enjoyable over all i have only just dipped my toes into the campaign however i will be doing more of it i think with all the improvements to arma youll still get those good ole arma moments like clipping through wallsfloors and your vehicle exploding on contact with a weed or bush

you dont buy crack for sometime in the future just like you dont buy arma if you plan on going to work the next day

ok i played abit rfacepalm and want to give some words to the community and maybe the developer aswell 1 sorry for my bad english hope youll get the point of what i want to say here 2 go along if you play wasteland or altis life most of your time 3 who iam veteran in fps since 1991 had my first 286 in early 90s have a real life and like to play some time imean for any genre of game you can go to the [steam]shop and play simulation rpg comic violence etc i just want you all get my point quikly because thats the deal dont wast your time i mean seriously dont waste your $7 time in a game that made for simulate players act together in a prebriefed style in a game that made for bring realistic fun to deal with enemies not like arcade style in a game that was made for coop and now 90% server out there are singleroleplay in a game that is full of bugs but beauty in detail  when you can be level 1000 at bf4cod in a game with a community of real soldiers that lost real buddies by teamkilling them in a game that need alot of fingersytle wasd wont bring you fun at all in a game that is rated 18  not infact 60% kiddies trolling the servers i could go on like that if you want so get your positive things out of iti mean this game have moments which i cant describe in words and actually the bad situation had taking me to write this reviewhave fun in playing  hopefully as a team

its tough to review this game because steam doesnt have a soso category the game is gorgeous even though it chugs on my rig that works great for any other game so heres an easy way to review the game gameplay  610  the singleplayer elements i dont play mp on this yet are really hit and miss the weapon accuracy albeit accurate still leads to the ai being incredibly cheap you can hide under bushes and the ai will shoot you from 2 miles away and you will definitely die you shoot at them 20 times and you will maybe hit them once but they seem like terminator robots that never go down this can be incredibly frustrating because youll get sent back 20 minutes to a way earlier part of the mission to do the next thing that i have a grip about this game could definitely be called forest running simulator 2014 you will spend hours running in the forest and really doing nothing at these point to traverse to another part of the island which is not too amusing when you do this and get hit once and then have to do it all over again lastly from the negatives is the control and interface its fun to learn and difficult to master is one thing but this game has its own language practically when it comes to the bizarre control set lots of bugs but what game doesnt have a ton of bugs especially games that come out of eastern europe note not trying to be offensive its just that a large list of games from that region started with bugs galore except the witcher on the good side of gameplay is the fact that the extensibility of the game is huge so many options so many details and subsystems that its honestly cool to see new options you have seen once after playing for a few days and spotting something new each time the realism factor could either be a great selling point or loss to you warning if you are expecting call of duty battlefield or even operation flashpoint then you will more than likely dislike this game from a gameplay perspective graphics 610  the game is gorgeous in every single way navigating the underwater areas and the night settings are especially a sight to see the only reason that the graphics score is lower than perfect is the fact that the animations are really hit or miss this is also particularly clear when it comes to watching people talk during the gameplay its something that takes you out of the realism of the game sound 410  the voices and gun noises are pretty awful theyre definitely workable from a gameplay aspect but sometimes youll just hear something like one of the truck horns and think did they record a boat horn mixed with a clown car  all in all if you added up the score of the game from this little review it would make the game overall be pretty crappy but thats the beauty of the game so far its a work in progress being made by a team that really cares each time i play the game youll see a note from the dev saying that they polished xyz or the community addressed the issue who knows in a few months most of my gripes may be solved by the devs but regardless of all of that id recommend this game to any hardcore pc gamer
recommended
best war simulator ever highly recomended 
recommended
its a pretty good game if you can get past its many bugs and dsync issues
recommended
i have played the predecessors for a long long time and always thought of them although crooked the games to end all games for me then arma 3 came along and now i know that arma 2 and especially arma were good games but far from being the nearly perfect games i made them out to be im not on about realism because it is a game after all no game can ever come close to the real thing and it would be a horrible game if it would think of realism as things like take a bullet to the head in game and never be able to play ever again what i am on about is the level of immersion that arma 3 can put you under real stress can make you involuntarily shout out incoming or make you race for virtual cover make you flinch and instill fear for your virtual life this time around the experience is hindered by far fewer bugs and glitches than in any arma game ever the inventory system has been reworked vehicle and aircraft physics have been improved the engine has been rebuilt from scratch all while retaining a feel very much like arma 2 in essence this game is the best arma ever released  improved on all fronts no features lost in translation on top of the technical aspect even though this game hasnt been live for a long time now it has already been modded customised and improved by the vast loyal and savvy community to a degree that arma 2 saw about 23 years after its release  and there is far far more to come can i recommend this game yes is it a game for everybody no but it is a game everybody should try this has been the only game i have bought for full price 4499  in years and i dont regret a single cent spent what are you still waiting for get arma 3 it will be different from anything youve ever played except arma 2
recommended
great game for any military entusiast
recommended
arma 3  where do you start all the kinks of arma 2 have been cleared the engine runs smooth the animations even smoother and the optimisation is always on the up and up throught out armas history it has been clearly building up to this the arma game to end all arma games if you are considering buying remember this isnt a fast action shoot emup but sometimes it can be this is tactical and stealthy also if you buy this game and need someone to play it with you  hit me and the 45th up d
recommended
dont play single player play multiplayer
recommended
if you havent already bought this game its a must buy its 40% off atm get it while you can
recommended
no this is in no way better than call of duty i feel cheated with this game its too hard and endlessly complex
recommended
buy it for wasteland mod never regret
recommended
another great addon to the arma series i suggest wasteland for pvp only needs
recommended
ughwhat else is there to say about arma 3 theres so many things a huge open world so detailed and so great thats amazing an awesome community that loves playing tactically i could go on for daysyou just have to try it here take the money just buy it your still focusing on my review go ahead and buy it buy it now nownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownow

you wont regret this unless youre foshotm
recommended
absolutely phenomenal game expect lack luster performance on amd chipsets though
recommended
for the tactical junkie not for those who want another call of duty even battlefield and ghost recon some of the best shooters of our time dont stack up to the tactical and realism aspects of this game there is a lot to learn about playing this game its very controlintensive and takes a lot of memorizing how to execute certain functions this is truly a simulation not a typical shooter this game gets extra points for its expandability and modability only negative points can be difficult to learn but worth it is a little slow to respond to control movements sort of adds to realism though and there is not enough campaign yet
recommended
i wouldnt call it the greatest simulator i would call it pure fun though deffinately a reccomendation to anyone looking for a highly moddable and enjoyable game the campaign is also quite enjoyable multiplayer on the other hand will make you face endless frame rate drops and purely bad performance this is expected for a game of this scale but the games performance is really my only downside highly reccomend this game on the other hand
recommended
very good game just need to fix bugs i recommend it to all
recommended
awsome game 
recommended
arma the most respected milsim series to date serious play thats the objective fun isnt a word i would use its not casual you simply cant hop in play 15 minutes and then hop out the enjoyment comes from finding a server and getting to know people playing with them when you take on hour long missions thats the enjoyment first thing i have to say really which i almost forgot about its real scale the maps really should be called environments you cant drive from one side of the island to another in minutes the battlefield is really a battlefield while most modern games focus on a small segment of a city town or something arma is about the openess making you sniper bait you have to look hard for hostiles they could be shooting at you from a hill across the valley performance was it terrible the first few days after release even still ai seem to cause a drop in fps even though they are far away this isnt latency this is pure frame for frame output never really understood how something unoptimized got pushed out that being said they follow valves ideas and push out updates for free i play with a gtx 560ti and core i7 870 cpu matters gpu matters i3 wasnt up for the task even with a 4ghz clock you need an i7 or 8core amd heat monster to play with details if you can push your rig you get to see things that many dont get to see n00bs will have a large hill to climb in regards to learning the game 710
recommended
fun game but not worth more than $20 many bugs desync etc issues that were prevalent in arma 2 but were never fixed
recommended
whats the matter everyone are you not ready to play god at this moment are you chillin just thinking why you hate brocoli are you afraid of a little discipline well dont just think this game is excellent ps watch for goats

it bleeds awesomeness and oozes excellence this game as gotten multiple updates since release and is still very fun i love bohemia and love arma
recommended
fun army simulator game although i play it for the rpg city life element its also less buggy in comparison to its predecessor arma 2
recommended
worst game
recommended
this game is like no other i have many hours spent in every build of this game from alpha to release and i can proudly say that i enjoyed every single one of them this isnt a game for everyone there is no real guidance on what you are intended to do the tutorials are confusing and you will find yourself dying from all directions in combat missions much of the games fun is drawn from the sheer uniqueness of its conflicts  from small 4 man espionage missions at night to full on assaults with armored sections and infantry alike there are few games that i could irrefutably consider a true sandbox and arma 3 is probably one of the best sandbox experiences around with practically limitless mission oppurtunities from the community due to the excellent mission designer already implemented visually this game is absolutely breathtaking at high settings  night time is probably the most stellar with its pitch black atmosphere and night vision opticals are almost a definite requirement  vehicle lights and weapon lights cast beams through the shroud of night tracer rounds meander across the vast fields of altis destroyed vehicles emit a vicious explosion and emit plumes of smoke daytime is equally impressive with armas mesmerizing sky boxes and vast expanses of land which seem to travel infinitely i dont feel like writing more right now but ultimately arma 3 is a visually stunning virtually endless sandbox of military endeavours
recommended
very difficult to learn if you just want something like cod or battlefield dont get 8310

dont buy this trash game looks good on streams looks and sounds fun as f but the game is trash fps chop all servers in games with 124 players i got like 100fps  all max settings games with 70100 people i got like 2040 fps chopping also the game lags alot the mic chat is godawful annoying people in global chat with there mics lagging bad due to severs the game is worth 1020$ tops until they fix the problem they never fixed in arma 2 or never will fix cuz they suck at scam money from people worst game of the year no joke

i have put over 1000 hours into this game played the  out of it edited and made missions all night till the sun came up it is the best military sim you will ever play anything can be done in this game and the mods make this stupid realistic it can fit a run and gun play style or you can do it tactically personally i played it with a handful of friends and even underwent training from a guy with 9 years in special forces this game is the real deal and you will not find one like it that being said i have stopped playing arma because of their money loving developers who really bent their fans over and violeted them in their nono places the game still runs poorly on high end systems there are hundreds of content missing from the game that was promised since prior alpha but god forbid they are releasing pointless dlcs to squeeze every penny out of our wallets go karts seriously and not ot mention a helicopter dlc that adds 22 new helicopters that are already in the game you just cant fly them for $15 if thats not the biggest scumbaggery i have ever seen then i dont know what is overall the game is fantastic but the devs have completely lost my support and respect that being aside i will give this game my 1010 for the sake of arma but id rather give it a zero because of bohemia interactive

this game costs too much but its pretty sweet

arma 3 the game is good still not as good as arma 2 imo more content in arma 2 then what it is in arma 3 but the modding community fixes that to like 100% adding more guns and armies and now that bohemia is adding karts into the game after a april joke thing and then adds it as a pay dlc sure the money goes to charity but why need some karts when are the dlcs that acctualy are usefull like in arma 2 where dlcs added more armies and units czech republic dlc and brit dlc those where good dlcs now we get sniper dlc helicopter dlc kart dlc like what but yea the game is good overall even though the server browser is compleatly empty with servers and sinse zeus came out i though there was going to be tons of servers running it but nah not a single server is running it so use zeus in sp editor much better do i recommend the game yes 710 no servers and  dlcs that have no use

arma 3 is an ambitious title with a style of gameplay that will polarize players the many complexities and amount of controls to master can be a daunting task for any newcomer to the series while seasoned vets will feel right at home for better or worse there is a great deal to learn about playing arma in a way that is enjoyable the default campaign mode is passable with all the tropes youd expect to find in a military shooter with a few surprises here and there missions vary in length and scope ranging from short range patrols to full on combined operations assaults
recommended
the best war simulator
recommended
like its predecessors arma 3 succeeds at supplying a realistic entertaining and accurate game experience that provides great scenery new weapons and units a communitybased scenerio workshop and a game that can be played professionally with a developed community or leisurely on a public server

kim jongil korean pronunciation [imdzil] 16 february 1941  17 december 2011 was the supreme leader of the democratic peoples republic of korea commonly referred to as north korea from 1994 to 2011 he succeeded his father and founder of the dprk kim ilsung following the elder kims death in 1994 kim jongil was the general secretary of the workers party of korea wpk chairman of the national defence commission of north korea and the supreme commander of the korean peoples army the fourthlargest standing army in the world in april 2009 north koreas constitution was amended to officially refer to him and his later successors as the supreme leader of the dprk[3] the most common colloquial title given to him during his reign was the dear leader   to distinguish him from his father kim ilsung the great leader the north korean government announced his death on 19 december 2011[4] whereupon his third son kim jongun was promoted to a senior position in the ruling workers party and succeeded him[5] after his death he was designated as the eternal general secretary of the workers party of korea and the eternal chairman of the national defence commission in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead members of the kim dynasty birth soviet records show that kim was born yuri irsenovich kim[6] in the village of vyatskoye near khabarovsk in 1941[7] where his father kim ilsung commanded the 1st battalion of the soviet 88th brigade made up of chinese and korean exiles kim jongils mother kim jongsuk was kim ilsungs first wife inside his family he was nicknamed yura while his younger brother kim manil born alexander irsenovich kim was nicknamed shura however kim jongils official biography states he was born in a secret military camp on baekdu mountain korean  in japaneseoccupied korea on 16 february 1942[8] official biographers claim that his birth at baekdu mountain was foretold by a swallow and heralded by the appearance of a double rainbow across the sky over the mountain and a new star in the heavens[9] according to one comrade of kims mother lee min word of kims birth first reached an army camp in vyatskoye via radio and that both kim and his mother did not return there until the following year[10][11] in 1945 kim was four years old when world war ii ended and korea regained independence from japan his father returned to pyongyang that september and in late november kim returned to korea via a soviet ship landing at sonbong  also unggi the family moved into a former japanese officers mansion in pyongyang with a garden and pool kim jongils brother drowned there in 1948 unconfirmed reports suggest that fiveyearold kim jongil might have caused the accident[12] reports indicate that his mother died in childbirth in 1949[13] however unconfirmed reports suggest that his mother might have been shot and left to bleed to death[12] education according to his official biography kim completed the course of general education between september 1950 and august 1960 he attended primary school no 4 and middle school no 1 namsan higher middle school in pyongyang[14] this is contested by foreign academics who believe he is more likely to have received his early education in the peoples republic of china as a precaution to ensure his safety during the korean war[15] throughout his schooling kim was involved in politics he was active in the childrens union and the democratic youth league of north korea dyl taking part in study groups of marxist political theory and other literature in september 1957 he became vicechairman of his middle schools dyl branch the chairman had to be a teacher he pursued a programme of antifactionalism and attempted to encourage greater ideological education among his classmates[16] kim is also said to have received english language education at the university of malta in the early 1970s[17] on his infrequent holidays in malta as guest of prime minister dom mintoff[18] the elder kim had meanwhile remarried and had another son kim pyongil since 1988 kim pyongil has served in a series of north korean embassies in europe and was the north korean ambassador to poland foreign commentators suspect that kim pyongil was sent to these distant posts by his father in order to avoid a power struggle between his two sons[19] the 6th party congress and heir apparent 19801994 by the time of the sixth party congress in october 1980 kim jongils control of the party operation was complete he was given senior posts in the politburo the military commission and the party secretariat according to his official biography the wpk central committee had already anointed him successor to kim ilsung in february 1974 when he was made a member of the seventh supreme peoples assembly in february 1982 international observers deemed him the heir apparent of north korea at this time kim assumed the title dear leader   chinaehann jidoja[20] the government began building a personality cult around him patterned after that of his father the great leader kim jongil was regularly hailed by the media as the fearless leader and the great successor to the revolutionary cause he emerged as the most powerful figure behind his father in north korea on 24 december 1991 kim was also named supreme commander of the korean peoples army since the army is the real foundation of power in north korea this was a vital step defence minister oh jinwu one of kim ilsungs most loyal subordinates engineered kim jongils acceptance by the army as the next leader of north korea despite his lack of military service the only other possible leadership candidate prime minister kim il no relation was removed from his posts in 1976 in 1992 kim ilsung publicly stated that his son was in charge of all internal affairs in the democratic peoples republic in 1992 radio broadcasts started referring to him as the dear father instead of the dear leader suggesting a promotion his 50th birthday in february was the occasion for massive celebrations exceeded only by those for the 80th birthday of kim ilsung himself on 15 april that same year according to defector hwang jangyop the north korean government system became even more centralized and autocratic during the 1980s and 1990s under kim jongil than it had been under his father in one example explained by hwang although kim ilsung required his ministers to be loyal to him he nonetheless and frequently sought their advice during decisionmaking in contrast kim jongil demanded absolute obedience and agreement from his ministers and party officials with no advice or compromise and he viewed any slight deviation from his thinking as a sign of disloyalty according to hwang kim jongil personally directed even minor details of state affairs such as the size of houses for party secretaries and the delivery of gifts to his subordinates[21] idealized portrait of kim jongil by the 1980s north korea began to experience severe economic stagnation kim ilsungs policy of juche selfreliance cut the country off from almost all external trade even with its traditional partners the soviet union and china

arma 3 is an improvement in many aspects from arma 2 the graphics are more realistic the movements are more fluid and i find the vehicles are easier to control this is a game that you will either absolutely love and play a lot or you will hate it the arma games arent easy to learn by yourself it takes time and patience to become fluent in the controls you need to approach them with an open mind great versatility for mods and modders the ingame mission editor is fantastic to use and great for trying out all that arma 3 has to offer 1010 do recommend

the overall experience you get from arma games is good but bugs are to be expected the game feels like an actual war simulator one shot can either kill or hurt badly medkits are must have and the missions are a fun experience the game is reccomended when you have a couple of friends with you it gets dull and boring if you are alone like any other game but with friends the whole satisfaction is improved

[update] arma 3 is a great military sandbox game that consists of campaign usermade scenarios multiplayer many different game modes dlcs that arent too pricy dlc buyers get items while at the same time supporting the development of arma 3 ____________________________________________________________ arma 3 in my opinion is a very realistic military simulator you have a lot of weapons to choose from and a lot of attachments there are 5 pistols 3 submachine guns 10 different types of assault rifles 3 designated marksman rifles 2 sniper rifles 3 lmgs thats not it though leave it to the developers to make even more guns coming up in the marksman dlc vehicles consist of afv4 gorgon amv7 marshal ifrit hatchback hemtt hunter mse3 marid strider suv tempest truck quadbike ugv stomper zamak go kart [was added in as a joke but people wanted it in the game as dlc content] 2s9 sochor btrk kamysh crv6e bobcat fv720 mora ifv6a cheetah ah9 pawnee ah99 blackfoot ch49 mohawk mh9 hummingbird po30 orca uh80 ghost hawk mi48 kajman a143 buzzard a164 wipeout to199 neophron speedboat swimmer delivery vehicle [submarine] assault boat think thats a long list thats a lot but not all each of the vehicles have their own unique features ____________________________________________ i bought arma 3 during the alpha stage when it wasnt too great however arma 3 has improved so much and the developers have made a lot of tweaksfixes

iz epic edit ok so since people probably didnt find this review good enough i decided to write a real professionally made review pros first off the controls are way better more customizable and generally feel nicer secondly the graphics are absolutely beautiful and i even got this to sorta run on my laptop which is wonderful and finally the multiplayer is a lot more open as far as ive seen youve got zeus which is fun when you play with friends theres altis life wasteland and a lot of things i havent seen in arma 2 yet oh and steam workshop support incredible cons as i said earlier the graphics are absolutely beautiful which means you need some highpowered nasa computer to run this on the highest graphical settings or you can switch to lowest and have no lag at all which in return gives you the worlds worst eyecandy theres also the long download times from my experience when you enter a server with the slightest hint of addons it seriously took me half an hour when i tried to join a regular coop server neutral thingys this game requires a lot of patience and tactical knowledge and with a lot i mean like a crapload of it this isnt your stereotypical pew pew fps this is as it says in the game desc a military simulator  youll rarely encounter baddies from my experience and when you do its bang bang and youre dead which is useful when youre on the winning side i mean theres just no hitmarkers only death im looking at you cod grumble grumble

i find arma 3 hard to play its single player is though the ai is merciless and some game mechanics are hard to get under control but wow arma 3 really comes to live when you play this game online with other people there are tons of good fun servers you could lose yourself in for days doing missions taking hours at an end under professional leadership from an hq pilots squad leaders and your mates you get to know them you dont want to die you leave no man behind and after a while you try to take leadership and people give you that the game is though the community takes that and owns that toughness by making the rules on yourself as a player though no lone wolfing this isnt battlefield this is a battlefield
recommended
arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons this time around its trump card is steam workshop integration though making downloading mods effortless a smart move by bohemia interactive because it are those mods that will give arma 3 its long lifespan unfortunately arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesnt seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts space time and perseverance are your best friends here until bohemias support starts paying off

altis life is the best mod on this game

youre going to need a good pc to run this with a reasonable amount of frames and youre going to need to abandon your call of duty mentality to truly enjoy this and youre also going to want to get serious about the mod community but if youre a fan of military style games and want a massive environment with no invisible walls then this is the game for you

the game needs a larger arsenal of guns and more vehicles for civilians otherwise i see that the game is going along quite nicely

the premier military simulator this game encompasses so much of what can be done in a video game ive spent a long time mastering small sections of the game but the level of content here is an ocean want to master the handling of medium range assault rifles thatll take a very long time to become a proficient master and even then you need to get used to special conditions night combat ranges recoil of the different rifles want to master helicopter flight dont even get me started the flight model is excellent and mastering just one model is going to take you quite a while beyond just the detail in each mechanic is the fun had here multiplayer servers are sandboxes and turn the game into a freeroam adventure with openended goals alternatively you can join servers where you are part of a cohesive unit fighting against other players or ai
recommended
after spending a fair amount of time with this game and pretending to live on a mediterranean island for the sake of a review i can say that arma 3 has its priorities straight the single player campaign is realistic enough and everything else about arma 3 is brutal remove all thought of call of duty or even battlefield from your mind try anything you see in cod and you will die and get laughed at health regeneration autoaim engagements less that 100 meters and shotguns are all things you willshould not see in arma 3 however you can live every stange military fantasy you wnat to shooting people sniping killing civilians being civilians drones diver assaults air support tanks cars sams mortars helicopters apcs towns camps hills forests valleys rpgs and more can all be part of the custom level that you build for yourself or even the world you owe it to yourself to at least try arma 3 at least once
recommended
this is the future of war games all it needs now is interactive cockpits for the aircraft tanks and other vehicles but the modding community is superb theres bound to be something for you in arma its not just war and guns and tanks and stuff you can go mountain climbing scuba diving skydiving and even command your own battalion of butterflies

arma 3 is a masterpiece that i think will be played for a a long time this game has beautiful graphics of terrain and objects gameplay mechanics are quite easy to learn but becoming a master takes time and practice you maybe able to kill from 100 meters but you will have to train to kill at 1000 there are a wide selection of weapons and clothing for your charicter ranging from ghille suits to civillian clothing where i think this game shines is the scale of combat with two absolutly huge maps and combat scenarios arma will never give you the same scenario twice this isnt any arcade shooter arma is a tactical shooter some would even call it a roleplaying game summary buy this game if you have a moderatly powerfull pc
recommended
sandbox multiplayer is awesome dont even bother going to ingame gun stores grab whatever rifle and equipment you can and make use i found a submachine pistol and a silencer a smoke grenade and some glow sticks left my car running on a busy road at night with the lights on and watched it surrounded it with glow sticks killed three people and came away with a decent back pack rifle and grenade launcher and a ghillie suit with space to pack my handy little pdw dont get angry when you get shot after hunting down the perfect kit and have to hike for miles and miles again downside @ 291114 is there are a lot of hackers at present and its ruining the fun this game still gets 5 out of 5 stars
recommended
best game everyou should definately try it out

best game ever i <3 arma

pretty fun but hard to get used to playing after playing arma 2 oa for so long

great game to play with your friends
recommended
what can i say about this game  good points is that its very modable and enjoyable with or with out mods  but this game comes to light when it has mods installed  bad point about the game is the stamina bar as seems the devs had so unfit poor soul run his  off as seems if you run more then 50 m you cant hit thing beacuse of your scope bouncing around all over the place when you stop  but overall it great game to play and the task force radio mod is must adds more depth and realism

arma 3 does not have time to teach you how to play it it does not have time to help you find someone to play with it lacks the common decency to provide a story of any kind at release bohemia interactives sandbox military simulation series began life in 2001 as operation flashpoint cold war crisis before the developer retconned its own title renaming the series arma updating the game for modern pc players was a tall order and after four long years of development arma 3 still isnt done bohemia interactive made the decision to release it anyway arma 3 may be the most challenging and the most rewarding online shooter i have ever played but its missing key components  most damning of all a singleplayer campaign as a result it feels more like a huge demo than a finished product
recommended
if you want to real reality you must play this game its wonderfull
recommended
i would recommend the game as played with friends campaign alone for example is ing pain in the  the ai companions are  and enemies seem to be at most points superhumans i mean they aim ridicilously well and they see even the slightest movement in a bush from one click away i mean seriously then you drop player alone in the middle of these superhumans fun eh well yeah if your ing physics would actually work and the forest and bushes would actually cover something i played opf series from the start and arma series from the start but this campaign and the ai in it is the absolutely worst but in the other hand when played with friends with a lot of frieds it is a good game player versus player massive multiplayer matches are fun their little ing  campaign is not
recommended
awsome game pritty nice grapics ran on full blast fps around 30 but will need a beafy computer to run it on full grapic but i really wish they could combine all arma 2 oa weapons and vehicles into this game and then it would be the best arma to me
recommended
its arma 3 a simulator you can simulate everything from real live to armagedon nice grafics nice gameplay 910 almost perfect
recommended
so this one is a weird one on the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system it is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic fps the game also looks pretty dang good on the other hand this game screams beta with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2 for example bipod integration still hasnt been going in that alongside the dlc being added even though the game is extremely unpolished simply put arma 3 is great but also a big dissapointment from me 6510 ps performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it
recommended
i have played this game for around 130 hours now and i just extremely enjoy it here are some pros and cons  indepth combat  realistic  infantry ground water and air combat  a  ton of mods  a  ton of custom missions  all the dlc is basically free every new feature will be available for everyone while you cannot drive certain vehicles you will be able to ride them as passenger and when there will be new features like the ability to slingload cargo you can do it as well without paying for the dlc  the game doesnt run that well even on the highestend machines you most likely wont get more than around 50 fps  there arent that much servers gamemodes like altis life seem to have taken over the server list resulting in a low amount of coop missions so expect to bring friends to this if you would like to play missions online  the games performance is heavily decided by the server if the server laggs you will not only get lagg but a low framerate as well here are some final ratings as well gameplay  fun  910 replayability  1010 performance  610 dlc  810 servers  510

this game is really beautiful on max settings even on low settngs the game is still visually impressivethe gameplay also is very good and smooth especially when you jump down some stairs and appear on the roof of a building 1010

arma 3 is great let me just start by saying are you sick of the troll kiddies running around with the cheapest weapons and using an auto aim assist and killing you right away i know i am this game gives you an immense feel for war and keeps you thinking constantly sometimes the action is spaced out quiet a bit but when the battle hits it is the gaming moments that stay with you forever plus getting that mega kill is something to actually be proud of with your skill and not just stupid luck
recommended
great for realism and simulation enthusiasts but if your just buying this for wastelands or because you liked dayz you can promptly  off and not get this game

arma 3 where do i start lets start with what arma is arma is a socalled milsim which basically means military simulator unlike call of duty or battlefield arma aims to achieve ultimate realism maps are massive a shot in the chest could mean instant death and a shot in the leg means crawling until a medic takes a look at it few games match the level of realism that the arma franchise has and while the controls can be strange at times and some of the bugs could make the game hilarious instead of serious the games are loved by the community behind it story i must admit that i havent delved too deep into the story but it consists of a number of chapters the first being survive the second adapt and the third win i got to somewhere around the middle of survive so please dont listen to me to the fullest regarding the campaign anyways you start the campaign as an american soldier stationed on the island of stratis which is the smaller of the two maps in arma 3 the larget being altis the american forces are just preparing to leave the island when they are attacked by an unknown force communications are quickly cut but you manage to get to your squad and together you complete missions around the island the missions vary from securing crash sites to attacking hostile bases imho the campaign is awesome and i do believe that there were some oohs and aahs exclaimed during some points of it 810 great story but once again do not take my word check the other reviews for a more detailed account on the storyline and so we move on to the next part multiplayer there are mutiple things you can do in the multiplayer hah get it no sorry c would you like to just kick back and play some relaxing roleplay then you can do that play as an ordinary citizen or a man of the law hunting some applestealing drugtrafficking criminals around the islands or maybe you would really like to hop on and play some wasteland where you must gather food and water and watch out for other players you can also gang up with some friends and build a badass base with walls and mortars and machine guns and a whole bunch of stuff so you have somewhere to go when youre not out hunting players or completing missions around the islands other game modes include domination coop vs ai join up with a group of players and take on the ai as you battle for complete control over stratis or altis king of the hill 3 teams blufor opfor and independent fight each other to control a certain area on one of the islands battle royale no point in looking for teammates on this one kill everyone else on the island and claim victory in this intense mod and many others 1010 amazing multiplayer great community one of my best multiplayer experiences ever gameplay there are quite a few bugs in the game however the ragdolls can sometimes act up and that can be frustrating sometimes but most of the time its just funny and they dont exactly ruin the experience graphics are top notch sound is really good and there are mods that improve them even further but the enemy ai can sometimes act like they have no brain that includes running around in circles when under fire simply lying down and making no attempt at figuring out where he is taking fire from but i guess that the ai just thinks that its so good that it doesnt really need to survive anyways 710 even though the ai is weird at times it certainly does not stop you from having a good time final verdict this review took a whole bunch of my time and i have probably forgotten what i wrote up at the top but arma 3 is overall a great game and is definitely worth it at full price however i believe that sales are quite common on this game so keep a look out for that apologies for any grammatical mistakes english is not my main language 90100

great game you wil have countless hours of fun just with the regular arma 3 getting bored thats fine just jump on a multiplayer server like altis life and you will be able to get many more hours of fun just make sure your pc can handle it
recommended
amazing military sim endless expansion posibilities and already plentiful mods
recommended
bohemias gone to immense effort to create real immersive environments for arma 3 across two sprawling islands youll find all kinds of terrain from saltflats to forests to stretches of rocky coastline even without a directed experience just spawning into those maps is a pleasurable experience letting you explore and discover some amazing virtual places arma 3 is also that rare  these days  game that will push all but the most powerful pc hardware it looks amazing even on older systems but if you want to crank it up at eyebleeding resolutions youre going to see performance loss

one of my favourite games ever definitely my favourite shooter almost all of my hours have been placed into wasteland survival and just practising my helo skills  if you are to pick this game up be aware that there is a steep learning curve and practically every key has a function ive put 100s of hours into many aspects of the game and ive still only scratched the surface one thing im eagerly anticipating is the arrival of the 2017 mod which is a dayz esce revamp of the game focused more so on surviving then wasteland
recommended
love this game amazing game to play meet new friends hang out with friends i would recommend this game to everyone i knew

great and awsome military lovers game  you can enjoy how realistic is it  how many weapons it includes  those pretty detailed driving transports and how many different vehicules  the thing that i like is the workshop it s fans are too creative there always something new to try  some mods you will enjoy for free  its developpers arent lazy at all  there is many updates and many news they are working pretty hard to make this game more special  funny dlcs d thats my opinion share me with yours i would be glad to hear it

story it is a soldier that sprays bullets at his enemies and his breathing very fasthis name is arman and hes a good soldier who is not from usa but he thinks the usa is good his brother is german so he died in the war arma is now in finding brothers footsteps may make his family had placed but the poor cope with this
recommended
tons of fun if you know where to look and when you play with friends either ones you already know or ones you meet online the communities that i have seen online so far are all friendly and play the objective for the most part overall this game runs great for me with a little optimization and the level of coop and competitive play could last me hundreds of hours of tactical enjoyment
recommended
my favorite multiplayer game also bunch of various mods
recommended
really good war game
recommended
depends on the mod altis life  depends on server but most are fun unless you find one that is filled with squeakers and trolls recommend httpwwwtherevolutiongamingcom a3lglitchy but fun at times roll back and total loss of bank was turn off after finding out the streamers were compd httparma3lifecom king of hill wasteland fun but rarely find people to play with

a lot of fun in general and a whole bunch of awesome mods

i have been looking for a game like arma 3 since i started with shooters i always thought call of duty or battlefield 34 was the most simulated you could get without really going to war this game is war this simulator requires players to really try it is not a run and gun game you do that you die you need to be tactical aware of your surrondings and be prepared for anything from a fireteam of men to a sniper team to tanks sitting on the hilll line everything about this game is amazing grapihc are awesome if you can run them on normal or higher the ai and ragdolling could use some work one con of this game is the ai sometimes there smart sometimes there dumb they can get hit with a grenade at point blank range break there legs lay down and bandage then get up and run away over all 2010 would recommend to anyone who wants a good shooting simulator
recommended
game is easily wroth the money the story mode keeps you on your toes the online well what can i say if get tired of one game mode theres lots of other to try then the workshop add that much more to the game a great game wroth the buy

got kidnapped by a gang called isis they forced me to rob a bank with them then took me into the mountains and made me fill up their helicopter with heroin and cocaine when i was done they got ready to sacrafice me for allah just as they were about to kill me they police showed up on mass and killed them all one of the commanders had responded to my desperate texts he gave me some food and a free backpack the system works would get kidnapped again 1010
recommended
visual quality  10 outstanding gameplay mechanics  9 this may not feel like your average first person shooter slower paced then most mainstream shooters the controls feel solid and actually shooting someone feels increasingly satisfying also the game will slowly force you into using a more planned and strategic tactic when facing your target as using the run & gun tactic will get you killed in this war simulator multiplayer  65 poor performance drives away the whole experience sound  8 although clumsy at times some sound effects may postively enhance your experience i would definately recommend this game
recommended
this is a great military simulator much like arma2 but completely improved graphics dialogue etc the campaign is pretty long and there is also enough scenarios to keep you busy for a good 30 hours solo but after that there the multiplayer which is 100% more fun with friends overall great military simulator but it is a simulator this isnt call of duty fellas yes there is bang bang in every mission but it it a simulator cannot stress enough if you want to get the most fun out of this game then you need to role play and not go all cod style and run and gun everything with 2 legs save that for multiplayer appart from that i had many hours of enjoyment and many more to come
recommended
most imersive shooter ive ever played tons of mods and wonderfull gaming experience when you have a performant pc and good clan to play it with  check out black legion httpwwwblacklegioncouk to see what we do in arma iii

with a 6 years of gaming this is the best game i played hands down with a realistic gamepaly and everything there is some bugs here and there but let me tell you even these bugs are fun and enjoyable i have over 1000 hours of playing this game and i still learn new things about it get this game right now

probably the best modern shooter and sandbox game  minus points for being a bit glitchy sometimes
recommended
great upgrade from arma 2 highly recommend

the game is awesome very realistic army simulator
recommended
this game is one of the best games i have ever played it beats cod and battlefield by a long shot the only problem i have with this game is that it crashes alot on lap tops 
recommended
very nice game 
recommended
figured out how to use the new firing positions then figured out you could use them to break dance 1010
recommended
arma 3s features in comparison to the previous arma is sustantial npcs no longer have extremely odd path finding patterns and animations are much smoother the recorded voices for commands and such are more lively and smoother npc dialogue or qeued dialoge seems more intone with the situation command voices for specific objectives run smoothly and actually sound more pleasent bohemia interactive really showed what they can do this time 55

great game fun playing with friends and just having fun
recommended
one of my favorite games on steam has a great variety of ways to play both in gamemodes and roles sounds great and looks great only negative thing i can say is that some servers dont restart often enough leaving the server a bit laggy
recommended
my lav got explode by a tente 1010
recommended
i dont even own this game 2210 its okay ign
recommended
i cant write reviews but here is an interesting fact 5 in 4 people dont understand statistics
recommended
amazing game hours of fun played on this and many more to come
recommended
i have heard many things about this game such as its poorly optimized or its too laggy yes it is poorly optimized in some situations but when it comes to graphics knowyour computer specs and dont argue when it lags because you bought the game without looking at your computer specs and noticing their bad in my opinion this game is very fun it is a very realistic game because crashing a car that your in will hurt you getting shot in the head will kill you when sniping there is bullet drop i love this game not only for its graphics but mostly for the gameplay i will note that i reccomend having friends to play with on the game because its not so fun alone well at least there are some nice people in the game others willbe totlal douches as a teamate i love to play gamemodes such as king of the hill wasteland and battle royal but not so much i will rate this game a 82510 due to the lag even on low setting also if you have the settings too low for your computer the game will lag i can play this game at 50fps on ultra settings
recommended
like skyrim with infidels

after 400 hrs playing arma3 i find it exciting and challenging the editor is another world on its own then theres muitiplay a whole lot af different roleplay  from police dedicrebel and even sell body parts  i give it a 10 as far as rpg go

this game is fun to play with friends or by your self there are lots of game modes you can download and install such as battle royalwastlandaltis life ext if you are bored of playing multiplayer dont know how you would be you could play the campain or play some of the show cases 1010

arma 3 the best military sim out there me and my squad load into the plane just another drop in an enemy town the plan was to sabotage th aa so we could carpet bomb the place our recon  up we were supposed to drop in far enough away so are plane wouldnt get hit but apparently the aa were farther up than expected jump jump jump our sargent said we all jumped into the forest surrounded by the enemy we all rallied at the plane crash and decided to fortify there to hold off the enemy we will die today men but for every man hit ten of theirs will fall they closed in we shot six rounds they responded with artillary oohh the artillary i surived with broken legs just me all alone as i crawled through the carnage i saw sarge lying their blood seeping through his cloaths i black out from the loss of blood and i never wake up ever ever again
recommended
a little hard to get use to and takes alot of skill but is the game of which i have spent the most amount of time on and never get bored of due to the completely dynamic multiplayer and community made missions and mods this game is truly a hell of an experiance and i personally recommend it especially to persons who may be either interested or are already in the millitary
recommended
workshop is nice also a rather nice physics engine and nice multiplayer
recommended
arma 3 is amazing it has lots of variaty and uses tons of tactics and different stratagies arma 3 is tons of fun it is insanely fun with friends its a great game and i recommend it to anyone
recommended
cant recommend it more try it out
recommended
arma 3 is one of my top 5 favourite games it has 2 massives maps to play on and millions of mod like breaking point arma 3 life battle royal and many more overall this game is massively awesome so why not try it out
recommended
10  graphics 95  sound 10  gameplay 97  voice acting 10  potential modding and custom mission scenarios overal this is a great game
recommended
arma 3 another great hit after the arma 2 from bohemia interactive great openworld game graphics are quite good with the gameplay and game mechanics another feature for this game it is a huge target for modders contains many fun modes as well many coop modes and multiplayer modes one of the more popular is the battle royal mod and also the campain is very interesting on the other hand the bad things are mostly the optimisation its openworld and good graphics come at a heavy price takes a good computer to have a full expirience
recommended
1010 would be a rabbit again

game is  88
recommended
the most complex and realistic tactical military shooter  once ghost recon went down the tubes after ghost recon 1 this filled the void for me and gets allot of my attention and game time 
recommended
i have now been playing arma3 for a few weeks or months time flies when youre having fun and it is one of my favourite purchases on steam i had aram2 and ao then modded dayz so i figured why the hell not for the past 510 years i have been more so a fan of multiplayer gaming over singleplayer thought i thought to myself i will try this one single first mainly due to the fact i wanted to know how smooth it ran graphics up pretty much full played it and had an average framerate more than 30fps so all is good i have a little play of single player and start to pick it up game looks great few km of open sandboxcant complain i try joining a server stratis wasteland 70 players smaller map then the main one 193km or something i think spawn in and streight away i head some explosions and firing luckily enough on my first go online i managed to take out the two guys firing and loot a vehicle nice rifle and a nightstalker scope i just sat in a bush my sights scimming around and taking out the odd players 1 by 1 night time comes change scope to thermals beautiful hiding up a hill sat in a bush with a thermal scope and another 2 clips if ammo to use i felt how sadistic i had become beautiful this was just wasteland mode however there are many other modes altis rp i would say is the most populated a role play island where a player will need to gain licenses buy weapons vehicles basically its what gta online would be like i reccomend picking up some scenarios from the workshop such as whole lotta altis and whole lotta stratis as we as some of the mission generators if youre amazing at cod dont expect to be amazing at this this is a real game and does require a lot of skill and thought no running in expecting to kill 30 in a row
recommended
loved this game from day one now 6 months later i still love it
recommended
i strongly recommend getting this game to anyone that has a good pc and enjoys the likes of battlefield and maybe call of duty and anyone that has previously owned a amra game
recommended
very fun few fps issues but they dont effect it in a mayjor way community support is great developers listen to bug reports very wide varity of game modes

after the great operation flashpoint now arma cold war assault the first two armas where not that great but still very good and i enjoyed playing them for a long time arma 3 is my favourite part of the trilogy thanks to a good and thrilling campaign much better than cod or bf and the arma formula that perfectly works now ai does what you want their aim is very good and they are very helpful enemy seeks cover and is a real threat which makes the missions very thrilling like in the first three rainbow six or the first ghost recon the campaign feels very tense like operation flashpoint or the addon resistance and i really enjoyed it the game runs perfect on my two year old pc and it is sure beautiful the sound is also very good and the rifles dont sound like toyguns which adds to the war atmosphere voice acting is great too the controls are a bit difficult to master at first if you havent played the other games of the series but you get there with a little practice the new item system is also very good and now you can quick and easy change weapons put attachments on your rifle or grab some other gear overall this game is one of my favourite games of all time and its a true masterpiece and thanks to the community you have tons of content for free get it and enjoy it 
recommended
i disobeyed my 12 year old commanders orders and mortared our supply station

great game 1110 if you dont mind it murdering your system
recommended
it has isis now
recommended
youre going to need a good pc to run this with a reasonable amount of frames and youre going to need to abandon your call of duty mentality to truly enjoy this and youre also going to want to get serious about the mod community but if youre a fan of military style games and want a massive environment with no invisible walls then this is the game for you
recommended
the game needs a larger arsenal of guns and more vehicles for civilians otherwise i see that the game is going along quite nicely

the premier military simulator this game encompasses so much of what can be done in a video game ive spent a long time mastering small sections of the game but the level of content here is an ocean want to master the handling of medium range assault rifles thatll take a very long time to become a proficient master and even then you need to get used to special conditions night combat ranges recoil of the different rifles want to master helicopter flight dont even get me started the flight model is excellent and mastering just one model is going to take you quite a while beyond just the detail in each mechanic is the fun had here multiplayer servers are sandboxes and turn the game into a freeroam adventure with openended goals alternatively you can join servers where you are part of a cohesive unit fighting against other players or ai
recommended
i know it says recommended but if you have no patience or toleration for bugs crashes and a large amount of trolls and hackers dont get this game that being said if you are ok with dealing with a unoptimized buggy but awesome game it is best to wait for a sale because $60 is a large amount of money but if you are seriously considering getting the game read below     \  \  \ \  now to that you have the game start to familiarze yourself with the gameplay but dont get too frustrated because they can be a bit wonky if you have never played a tactical shooter once you do this there are two big player bases to this game rp roleplayers and milsimers hardcore tactical military simulation i am a mixture between the two but i cant say im more towards one or the other if you like the sound of doing roleplay and want to jump right in find a good altis life server my favortite is cgis server oh wait you dont like roleplaying but you really want to be a hardcore milsim player then my suggestion is to find an online military unit the 15th meu is a good one as i know a few people that are members with many of these military simulation units there are age limits it is usually 17 but all communities are different i really hope this review helped some people decide if this game is right for them as there are many people that absolutly hate the game and then there are people that are completely adiccted to it and play nothing else

recommended
people that make mods for this game do a better job than the devs 1010

the most joy you will get from this game isnt in the playing itself but instead the creating of your own custom content and seeing others enjoy it

a true life like of experience of war is to be had in this game certainly the conflicts of the middle east are encapsulated in the king of the hill servers driving around in your 200 dollar rented pick up truck not really knowing where you are going you squint awkwardly into the horizon then you zoom in with your scope because you realize you are dumb seeing little dots appearing you suddenly hear the distinct crack of gun fire being the smallest of the three factions you barrel out knowing the overwhelming st flinging powers of even just a small detachment of enemies the gunner fires wildly as the tires blow out and the car smashes into a wall he is now dead the passenger attempts to fix the car whilst you take over the gun firing randomly into the distance until the shooting stops the car is fixed you are still alive you make it into town and rendezvous with your comrades the truck stops as an rpg slams into it exploading and killing all inside you are dead you respawn and do it all again
recommended
coming from day z standalone this game was a new and exciting transition this game brings up alot of mixed feelings from my time in military service but humanizes it all in goofy and offbeat player to player combat the balistics are pretty on point for small arms and heavier weapons and the tutorial & story mode can be beneficial to all who are new or experienced i have never met so many young and old players who cooperate more and utilize military terminology communication direction and land navigation to enhance my total gaming experience from gathering a stockpile of marijuana on altis life rpg to spotting a targets range for indirect fire or close air support arma 3 has very little in terms of flaws but it is those small flaws and minor server glitches that add even more to the fun variable
recommended
this game is definently worth the money with gameplay ranging from straight out deatmatch wasteland altis life koth and zeus arma 3 brings a whole new style to first and third person shooters though there are a  of bugs in a way it kinda makes the game i have had so many countless omments just bursting out laughing at what my friends and i call arma physics and i feel the bugs are usually hillarious finally dont play campaign if you want a good campaign buy something like cod arma 3 has the most unique multiplayer experience ever and playing campaign is a waste of your time
recommended
if you like war rpg and survival this is your game but if you like realistic physics then this is your nightmare 
recommended
this ame sucks i cant stop playing it
recommended
very good game maybe not worth 35 but i advise getting it when it is on sale 910

very cool very swag i live it

ive only played it for a few minuetslol i really dont play much else very good game extrmely long learning curve if youre new to arma in any way bye bye cod & mwf

this game is very very awesome

this game is a sandbox and what you get out of it is what your imagination or the community behind you puts into it

wasted 200 hrs of my life 1010
recommended
a crazy amount of single and multiplayer content just like arma 2 but way more responsive with some new welcome additions to the already immersive experience if you like massive battlefields and as close to real life combat this is state of the art
recommended
reasons to play arma3 arma rp servers altislife etc battleroyale epoch breakingpoint etc crashed my truck full of cocaine in a random location in the middle of nowhere next to nothing thought all my work was wasted then out of nowhere a dude runs out of a bush repairs my car i tell him i have no money with me but i have coke gave him a bit and he ran away in a random direction 1010 would crash my car again
recommended
great game love it problems with helicopters and its blades might have been updated but still a great game and car hitpoints are messed so if you ram someone in the back your tires go  
recommended
fun game very badly optimized you will have tons of problems with your game and get low fps but if you have a really good pc that can play on ultra with 60 fps then you will probably get 2050 fps but there is a way top fix that if you really want to fix it but you dont have to if you can deal with a lower frame rate defintaly a fun game i cant see playing it alone very much must have friends in this a lot of people in this game can be either extreme a holes or really serious but fun people some servers require you to sign up and be accepted in but those can be the best i do recomend but only if it is on sale for $35 or lower hope this helped you
recommended
even though i just started playing this game i would already say it was worth my $60 the graphics are amazing and the detail makes everything look cool af the only cons i would say are there are so many different controls that you will be referring to the field manual very often also the keybindings are very awkward for people that play different fps often and are used to things like ctrl or c for crouch or space to jump or e for interact theyll be annoyed when they constantly forget its x to crouch i was also sort of  that i couldnt change the keybindings
recommended
first off i havent played enough of this game to write a full review i just want to shout out to all the people tempted by this game in the sale this game is amaziing or atleast what ive played of it so far i loved arma 2 but it felt a little bit stale compared to this game the world and charicters just feel that little bit more real which really help the immersition of a game like this music is good and can really build tenstion when needed and hype you up for the big fight upcoming i would highly recomend this game to anyone intrested in both fps and stratagy fans i would also recommend it to people who are intrested in warfair in generall you will not be disapointed  full review in an update once ive clocked in enough hours in this very indepth combat simulater
recommended
there are so many servers out there that being a new player to arma 3 does not constitute childish behavior of admins that say that i am being ignorant for that matter go have a nice 13year old life the server ip i would suggest for you to avoid is karmics pveliftmissionstraderstocked at ip 24123111062302 complete lack of social skills that admin had just because i did not constantly check my side bar does not make me ignorant i am still learning this game and i really dont give two  about who runs the flipping server i only want to have fun while learning the game and not be harassed when i log in about reading the mother flippin side chatbar for your information i do read whatever come up in the beginning just to see if anything important shows up if not i just walk or run around and play i give two fingers up for that server and admin toot
recommended
you can do stuff in this game
recommended
very nice and cool game
recommended
i would recommend the game as played with friends campaign alone for example is ing pain in the  the ai companions are  and enemies seem to be at most points superhumans i mean they aim ridicilously well and they see even the slightest movement in a bush from one click away i mean seriously then you drop player alone in the middle of these superhumans fun eh well yeah if your ing physics would actually work and the forest and bushes would actually cover something i played opf series from the start and arma series from the start but this campaign and the ai in it is the absolutely worst but in the other hand when played with friends with a lot of frieds it is a good game player versus player massive multiplayer matches are fun their little ing  campaign is not
recommended
awsome game pritty nice grapics ran on full blast fps around 30 but will need a beafy computer to run it on full grapic but i really wish they could combine all arma 2 oa weapons and vehicles into this game and then it would be the best arma to me
recommended
its arma 3 a simulator you can simulate everything from real live to armagedon nice grafics nice gameplay 910 almost perfect
recommended
so this one is a weird one on the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system it is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic fps the game also looks pretty dang good on the other hand this game screams beta with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2 for example bipod integration still hasnt been going in that alongside the dlc being added even though the game is extremely unpolished simply put arma 3 is great but also a big dissapointment from me 6510 ps performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it
recommended
i have played this game for around 130 hours now and i just extremely enjoy it here are some pros and cons  indepth combat  realistic  infantry ground water and air combat  a  ton of mods  a  ton of custom missions  all the dlc is basically free every new feature will be available for everyone while you cannot drive certain vehicles you will be able to ride them as passenger and when there will be new features like the ability to slingload cargo you can do it as well without paying for the dlc  the game doesnt run that well even on the highestend machines you most likely wont get more than around 50 fps  there arent that much servers gamemodes like altis life seem to have taken over the server list resulting in a low amount of coop missions so expect to bring friends to this if you would like to play missions online  the games performance is heavily decided by the server if the server laggs you will not only get lagg but a low framerate as well here are some final ratings as well gameplay  fun  910 replayability  1010 performance  610 dlc  810 servers  510

just like arma 2 theres a huge amount of variety in gameplay with this game the graphics are fantastic although most people probably wont be able to run this game on full settings at a reasonable framerate worth picking up even if youre not planning to play it in the immediate future

do you like to spend 30 minutes waiting to get deployed only to have your helicopter shot down by an enemy jet how about spending 20 minutes to get the the ao only to realize that your team has already captured it do you want to know the feeling of waiting for hours to get into combar just like real life if you want real military simulation including the time it takes to get into combat then this game is for you
recommended
realy nice game a few bad hacks and buggs still out for it but over all very good game

dear diary i have recently been deployed to altis it is my first tour of duty and already things are completely messed up i watched the lance corporal in my company try to fast rope and he ended up going through the roof of the helicopter surprisingly he didnt die until about 5 minutes later when he got ran over by a drunker contractor with severe road rage problems the second day didnt fair much better the staff sargeant and our driver were shot by snipers who then proceeded to come over and tell us how we got rekt right before they stole our truck and our canned beans day 3 was even worse we had to walk 20 km back to base because of the theft of our truck which we did find crashed into those sub compacts that can go 300kmh we lost simmons that daythank god we had ketchup day 4 was the worst day we got attacked by the snipers againi have yet to fire my weapon at an enemy i pass the time by going on 10km heights only to be chased by the drunken contractors again and masturbating freciously i find myself getting angry at our policies we cant go out into the field with our issued rifles instead we have to give money to the local shopkeep to buy our rifles and ammo his name is billy he is a nice guy i still have yet to take somebody down i did fire my pistol at an enemy only to be winged by a snipers bullet as it killed our company engineer after the last day of my deployment i am happy to leave altis we are now heading for another island called stratis to help with the war effort we will see how everything turns out day 153all is lost i ate another pfc again 1210 would get eat again
recommended
make arma not war arma is the best military simulator out there you will not believe the hours you can throw away at this game while playing the endless multiplayer servers such as life  in which nothing can compete grab some friends and join a server only then shal you understand brilliant 910
recommended
a fun game well can be fun if played with the right people on the right servers on the right game mode have fun
recommended
it is a cool game i like it 
recommended
this is my first time playing the arma series and i must say this game has changed my perspective of militarystyle fps games the realism is phenomenal and it keeps me coming back for more huge learning curve when trying to remember all the commands associated to the game which can get frustrating at times but once you get handle on those its a lot easier outside of that this game has something going whether its the closetoreality gameplay or all the other mods you can discover or the required teamwork needed to be succesful in crushing your opponent hands down my favorite game currently in my library
recommended
after you play this game ones you will never play another
recommended
great game you wil have countless hours of fun just with the regular arma 3 getting bored thats fine just jump on a multiplayer server like altis life and you will be able to get many more hours of fun just make sure your pc can handle it

amazing military sim endless expansion posibilities and already plentiful mods

bohemias gone to immense effort to create real immersive environments for arma 3 across two sprawling islands youll find all kinds of terrain from saltflats to forests to stretches of rocky coastline even without a directed experience just spawning into those maps is a pleasurable experience letting you explore and discover some amazing virtual places arma 3 is also that rare  these days  game that will push all but the most powerful pc hardware it looks amazing even on older systems but if you want to crank it up at eyebleeding resolutions youre going to see performance loss
recommended
one of my favourite games ever definitely my favourite shooter almost all of my hours have been placed into wasteland survival and just practising my helo skills  if you are to pick this game up be aware that there is a steep learning curve and practically every key has a function ive put 100s of hours into many aspects of the game and ive still only scratched the surface one thing im eagerly anticipating is the arrival of the 2017 mod which is a dayz esce revamp of the game focused more so on surviving then wasteland
recommended
love this game amazing game to play meet new friends hang out with friends i would recommend this game to everyone i knew
recommended
simply best of its series so far

recommended
good game great fun to play with friends
recommended
really good game 
recommended
i have always been a fan of the arma series because its really different than the other shooters there are so many different ways to play this game i spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment i dont play multiplayer that much but its still a great experience when i get to it this game is very heavily gpu and cpu dependant so i wouldnt reccomend this to people who have a lowmid range gaming pc mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of fps drops below 30 fps this game is really fun and easy to get into i am proud of the work that bohemia interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles i rate this game a 9510
recommended
v good game altis is best mod d
recommended
please give me back my time what i spend playing this excellent game d

1st time playing this i go on altis life with a friend heres how it went we spawned bought a bag and a hat each went picking apples for a few hours then bought a car each and went to do some delivery missions my friend crashed and i drove 185km to repair his car only to find he was dead 2 paramedics came and revived him i took the hat from my dead friends body first and offered it as payment the girl took the hat because the guy didnt like it and then accused me of being sexist because he wanted my hat he chased me around his ambulance for 10 minutes shouting give me the fing hat i dropped the hat drove off only to see the ambulance over take me and get blown up by terrorists i then burned in the wreck trying to get my hat back 1110

recommended
its cool
recommended
great game for anybody sick of the run and gun play style of cod battlefield and so on the editor is fun and easy to understand the multiplayer is a bit laggy but other than that perfect the community in arma is the best i have seen in any game and i think you should join it
recommended
awesome game would definitely reccomend
recommended
go buy it 8810

recommended
best pc gamenough said
recommended
absolutely love this friggin game
recommended
unlike arma 2  arma 3 can give much more not that arma 2 is bad its just that arma 3 is like gmod if you want to play darkrp you join a server other than downloading the addons and only picking from a small ammount of servers sometimes along with the ease of access to the numerous amounts of gamemodes it also has a certian play style to it
recommended
basically play it horses10
recommended
a relentless pseudoturn based dungeon crawler with no end of challenge the game features only two immediate and apparent difficulties too easy and easy dont let these difficulty titles fool you theyre a lot more daunting than they seem the dungeons are unforgiving one mistake or failure to prepare can ultimately lead to your cascading loss of the dungeon the already challenging difficulties can be further multiplied by selecting different escape pods that give new rules to your dungeon the greatest enemy you will face in the dungeons isnt the monsters its the random number generator whats in the next room monsters dust a much needed damagepersecond or utility hero maybe the room will be empty who knows whats in store for you in the depths of the dungeons of the endless this game is not for those who are looking for a casual dungeon crawler
recommended
amazing game probably my most favourite worth every penny
recommended
this aint cod  1010
recommended
great game lots of fun but they really need to fix all the f crashing one of the best games ever for 5 mins and then boom too much fun detected must crash such bulls 1010
recommended
this game is amazing while the campaign and vanilla multiplayer are extremely fun its not even the tip of the iceberg in terms of gameplay the real experience comes with the mods scripted game modes and editor included within the game or downloadable through various websites what bohemia interactive has done is give those with a vision the incredibly powerful engine and therefore a means to create the amazing gamemodes you can download anywhere and play
recommended
immediately upon entering a rp server i was asked to enter a strange vehicle held at gunpoint of course i hopped into the back of a black pick up truck and an invisible force prevented me from leaving i was then driven halfway across the island it was a long trip the strange man in the front seat told me a few stories some very touching others not as much by the end of the journey i felt much closer to the notsostrangeanymore man our brief 15 minutes together had me believing i had found a new friend a companion in this bleak world that belief was soon torn apart as the man in the front seat let out a guttural scream and drove us both into a lake your experience in arma 3 could be similar 1010
recommended
if you want a really good war game and dont want autistic five year old yelling hard scoper or the game telling you you are leaving the battlefield
recommended
i was able to pick up a snake 1010
recommended
this fps is quite unique instead of only pewpewpew or team fight this game provides a real battlefield not like dices battlefield seriesi wont call it a game but a military simulation softwareand theres plenty of mods in this game so its very playable one of my friend played this game for 60hrs in 2 weekssince this game is for the hardcore players so it wouldnt be very friendly to newcomers best military simulator ever1010 also btw dont think you can play this game with it told you the minimal system requirement of 8800gt my gtx460 still sucks for almost half of time
recommended
this game is terrible you should totally play it
recommended
my lav got explode by a tente 1010
recommended
i dont even own this game 2210 its okay ign
recommended
i cant write reviews but here is an interesting fact 5 in 4 people dont understand statistics
recommended
amazing game hours of fun played on this and many more to come
recommended
i have heard many things about this game such as its poorly optimized or its too laggy yes it is poorly optimized in some situations but when it comes to graphics knowyour computer specs and dont argue when it lags because you bought the game without looking at your computer specs and noticing their bad in my opinion this game is very fun it is a very realistic game because crashing a car that your in will hurt you getting shot in the head will kill you when sniping there is bullet drop i love this game not only for its graphics but mostly for the gameplay i will note that i reccomend having friends to play with on the game because its not so fun alone well at least there are some nice people in the game others willbe totlal douches as a teamate i love to play gamemodes such as king of the hill wasteland and battle royal but not so much i will rate this game a 82510 due to the lag even on low setting also if you have the settings too low for your computer the game will lag i can play this game at 50fps on ultra settings
recommended
like skyrim with infidels
recommended
after 400 hrs playing arma3 i find it exciting and challenging the editor is another world on its own then theres muitiplay a whole lot af different roleplay  from police dedicrebel and even sell body parts  i give it a 10 as far as rpg go
recommended
this game is fun to play with friends or by your self there are lots of game modes you can download and install such as battle royalwastlandaltis life ext if you are bored of playing multiplayer dont know how you would be you could play the campain or play some of the show cases 1010
recommended
pretty hot game played it for hours done everything you can really do and its still fun ape10
recommended
an amazing game and a great indepth simulator well worth buying if your system can handle it
recommended
i shot someone they died 1010
recommended
its a great game if you like tactical gameplay
recommended
great game with really good features even if you have arma 2 you should really buy this game too the only negitive things about it is you need a good pci mean good i advise checking the minimum requriments before you buy its a bit over priced should be about 25 and it crashes occasionally other wise its a fantastic strategic first and third person shooter with the most realism i have ever seen if you do buy arma 3 i would recomend downloading the battle royale mod via the internet it is essentially the hunger games except with guns it provides me with hours of fun
recommended
great game
recommended
arma 3 is my favorite simulation game i have played on steam its fun to play and you wont get tired of it the workshop is amazing for arma there are always lots of missions to play the helicopters and jets are fun to fly around in i dont like that there are limited amounts of weapons so if you want more guns you need to download a mod there is also no melee attacks over all arma 3 is a really fun game and i highly recommend this game
recommended
wait i dont own this game how can i make a review for it ive never even played it
recommended
absolutely love it
recommended
i can be an elite soldier with a big  gun while wearing nothing but my underwear
recommended
arma 3 is great let me just start by saying are you sick of the troll kiddies running around with the cheapest weapons and using an auto aim assist and killing you right away i know i am this game gives you an immense feel for war and keeps you thinking constantly sometimes the action is spaced out quiet a bit but when the battle hits it is the gaming moments that stay with you forever plus getting that mega kill is something to actually be proud of with your skill and not just stupid luck
recommended
great for realism and simulation enthusiasts but if your just buying this for wastelands or because you liked dayz you can promptly  off and not get this game
recommended
sick of the absurdness of the call of duty franchise or the so called realism of the battle franchise well switch to arma with stunning graphics and amazing lighting effects the realism in this game might be too much for some but thats what the games about true realism no idiot sprinting with a sniper rifle or ramming a jet at tanks here this game is for the mature audience not prestige 12 year olds
recommended
stop playing fake military games aka battlefield call of duty combat arms and start playing some real ones this game separates the kids from the men
recommended
best game for multiple reasons the singleplayer is actually good which i did not imagine the variety of multiplayer servers and game mode is amazing and can do so much like role playing taking over an objective and some other stuff the differences between this and arma 3 is so different like scuba diving gear and  anyway overall i think you should get this game if you are debating it but you may need a good rig to run it
recommended
very goodvery real
recommended
arma 3 where do i start lets start with what arma is arma is a socalled milsim which basically means military simulator unlike call of duty or battlefield arma aims to achieve ultimate realism maps are massive a shot in the chest could mean instant death and a shot in the leg means crawling until a medic takes a look at it few games match the level of realism that the arma franchise has and while the controls can be strange at times and some of the bugs could make the game hilarious instead of serious the games are loved by the community behind it story i must admit that i havent delved too deep into the story but it consists of a number of chapters the first being survive the second adapt and the third win i got to somewhere around the middle of survive so please dont listen to me to the fullest regarding the campaign anyways you start the campaign as an american soldier stationed on the island of stratis which is the smaller of the two maps in arma 3 the larget being altis the american forces are just preparing to leave the island when they are attacked by an unknown force communications are quickly cut but you manage to get to your squad and together you complete missions around the island the missions vary from securing crash sites to attacking hostile bases imho the campaign is awesome and i do believe that there were some oohs and aahs exclaimed during some points of it 810 great story but once again do not take my word check the other reviews for a more detailed account on the storyline and so we move on to the next part multiplayer there are mutiple things you can do in the multiplayer hah get it no sorry c would you like to just kick back and play some relaxing roleplay then you can do that play as an ordinary citizen or a man of the law hunting some applestealing drugtrafficking criminals around the islands or maybe you would really like to hop on and play some wasteland where you must gather food and water and watch out for other players you can also gang up with some friends and build a badass base with walls and mortars and machine guns and a whole bunch of stuff so you have somewhere to go when youre not out hunting players or completing missions around the islands other game modes include domination coop vs ai join up with a group of players and take on the ai as you battle for complete control over stratis or altis king of the hill 3 teams blufor opfor and independent fight each other to control a certain area on one of the islands battle royale no point in looking for teammates on this one kill everyone else on the island and claim victory in this intense mod and many others 1010 amazing multiplayer great community one of my best multiplayer experiences ever gameplay there are quite a few bugs in the game however the ragdolls can sometimes act up and that can be frustrating sometimes but most of the time its just funny and they dont exactly ruin the experience graphics are top notch sound is really good and there are mods that improve them even further but the enemy ai can sometimes act like they have no brain that includes running around in circles when under fire simply lying down and making no attempt at figuring out where he is taking fire from but i guess that the ai just thinks that its so good that it doesnt really need to survive anyways 710 even though the ai is weird at times it certainly does not stop you from having a good time final verdict this review took a whole bunch of my time and i have probably forgotten what i wrote up at the top but arma 3 is overall a great game and is definitely worth it at full price however i believe that sales are quite common on this game so keep a look out for that apologies for any grammatical mistakes english is not my main language 90100
recommended
brock the rock approves
recommended
mod breaking point dont miss it
recommended
arma 3 is a military simulator it gives the game a very realistic feel to it but the only issue is the fact that the developers of the game break things quite often and dont fix them for extended periods of time such as the new update that came out today
recommended
very hard to get bored of i love military games myself and this is by far my most favorite game and i havent even played much
recommended
its like gta but in a military way  the map is ing huge i never seen anything like this in anygame i also like how you can build your own forts and hold your territory and stop enemies from getting past ya by placing walls around your area and also place military cargo towers and have you and your fellow sniper team mates go on top of them and look around for any traspassers game has so many choices of misc items and weapon attachments and many tools and resources and the cars are good too but also you dont have to play in a military style if you want you can play as a normal citizen man and do your everyday life story there is nothing to complain about because this game is ing great i run this game on very high and i get 25 to 50 fps i had no problem at all with bugs so far this game hass amazing graphics the textures look amazing the models look very nice the effects lights and shading look very realistic best graphics on a open world game so far for me graphics 1010 gameplay 910 map 910 weapons 810 worth the $ bought this for 30$ when it was on sale buy it if you havent
recommended
the game is great but when i try to host my game crashes
recommended
its frustratingly fun so thumbs up
recommended
arma 3 is fun
recommended
altis life with friends is hours of fun
recommended
great immersive shooter do not recommend for call of duty players it is nothing like cod
recommended
one of the best games i have played 
recommended
there are lots of bugs and poor design choices thats for sure the graphics arent that great and the game runs like crap sometimes 25 fps on my top end system the game can also be really boring and frustrating like when you get stuck on rocks and have to restart a 2 hour mission that said i definitely recommend this game for someone whos tired of the same ol arcade shooters before i played arma i thought battlefield 3 was a military simulator lel this game is nothing like call of duty in arcade shooters like cod theres tons of action all the time and it gets mind numbing in arma action is pretty infrequent but when it does happen its really intense and unforgiving the missions are also very sandbox you can plan out your own strategies instead of just running through actionpacked repetitive levels its a hard game to learn it uses almost every button on the keyboard to this day i still dont know how to do some things such as use laser guided bombs if youre looking for a challenging intense true pc game you cant go wrong with arma iii
recommended
first i want to start off with the graphics amazing next it is a fun game many many many game modes to play i think there is some gamemodes that seem nerdy like rpg but give it a try it is fun this game with the graphics it is hard to run but you can also optimize it a bit and when i mean a bit you can increase the fps 1015 with easy steps sum it up get it
recommended
this combines the fps that every serious fps military gamer would want to play it has great customization for your apparel the guns are also easily customizable and it looks great on ultra high even better is the fact that it has a very active gaming community and workshop items are constantly being added also when you kill people you can rob their pants 1110
recommended
military simulation at its best if you want to try something different other than arcade codbf definitely give this a try
recommended
i have it now and i like it
recommended
best tactical fps ever really keeps you on you heels
recommended
fun game all around
recommended
workshop is nice also a rather nice physics engine and nice multiplayer
recommended
im just so glad this game doesnt have dayz

recommended
funnest  in multiplayer
recommended
the only reason why arma is a walking simulator is because everyone blatantly refuses to give you a lift anywhere some even call you a fatass for not walking accross half the map why they do this i have yet to figure out
recommended
whats people complaining about dlcs a rip off then dont buy the dlc no one asked you too but if you do want the dlc then buy the dlc bundle if you have the game already but if you dont have the game right now buy the extended edition you can wait for a sale on that this game is such an improvement over arma 2 graphics are better physics are better and now bipods if the game isnt running nicely you can go into the launcher and tweak the settings like adding more ram for the game to use and how much cores
recommended
doesnt matter how much i suck at 1 aiming 2 spotting 3 driving 4 flying 5 landing 6 commanding 7 decapitating 8 surviving i still love the game 910
recommended
the game is very overpriced but if youre a fan of military simulator you should buy it

i love and i hate it

[update] arma 3 is a great military sandbox game that consists of campaign usermade scenarios multiplayer many different game modes dlcs that arent too pricy dlc buyers get items while at the same time supporting the development of arma 3 ____________________________________________________________ arma 3 in my opinion is a very realistic military simulator you have a lot of weapons to choose from and a lot of attachments there are 5 pistols 3 submachine guns 10 different types of assault rifles 3 designated marksman rifles 2 sniper rifles 3 lmgs thats not it though leave it to the developers to make even more guns coming up in the marksman dlc vehicles consist of afv4 gorgon amv7 marshal ifrit hatchback hemtt hunter mse3 marid strider suv tempest truck quadbike ugv stomper zamak go kart [was added in as a joke but people wanted it in the game as dlc content] 2s9 sochor btrk kamysh crv6e bobcat fv720 mora ifv6a cheetah ah9 pawnee ah99 blackfoot ch49 mohawk mh9 hummingbird po30 orca uh80 ghost hawk mi48 kajman a143 buzzard a164 wipeout to199 neophron speedboat swimmer delivery vehicle [submarine] assault boat think thats a long list thats a lot but not all each of the vehicles have their own unique features ____________________________________________ i bought arma 3 during the alpha stage when it wasnt too great however arma 3 has improved so much and the developers have made a lot of tweaksfixes

do you like to spend 30 minutes waiting to get deployed only to have your helicopter shot down by an enemy jet how about spending 20 minutes to get the the ao only to realize that your team has already captured it do you want to know the feeling of waiting for hours to get into combar just like real life if you want real military simulation including the time it takes to get into combat then this game is for you

realy nice game a few bad hacks and buggs still out for it but over all very good game

dear diary i have recently been deployed to altis it is my first tour of duty and already things are completely messed up i watched the lance corporal in my company try to fast rope and he ended up going through the roof of the helicopter surprisingly he didnt die until about 5 minutes later when he got ran over by a drunker contractor with severe road rage problems the second day didnt fair much better the staff sargeant and our driver were shot by snipers who then proceeded to come over and tell us how we got rekt right before they stole our truck and our canned beans day 3 was even worse we had to walk 20 km back to base because of the theft of our truck which we did find crashed into those sub compacts that can go 300kmh we lost simmons that daythank god we had ketchup day 4 was the worst day we got attacked by the snipers againi have yet to fire my weapon at an enemy i pass the time by going on 10km heights only to be chased by the drunken contractors again and masturbating freciously i find myself getting angry at our policies we cant go out into the field with our issued rifles instead we have to give money to the local shopkeep to buy our rifles and ammo his name is billy he is a nice guy i still have yet to take somebody down i did fire my pistol at an enemy only to be winged by a snipers bullet as it killed our company engineer after the last day of my deployment i am happy to leave altis we are now heading for another island called stratis to help with the war effort we will see how everything turns out day 153all is lost i ate another pfc again 1210 would get eat again

this is a realistic shooter with teamwork and everything at some points you can be so immersed into this game that you think you are a real soldier that is fighting in a war i also think this is a game that people would say buy this game for me to their friends or family for the holidays

arma 3 is a good game you should buy it unless youre a part of isis

went to war in a kart driver outfit and got shot in the head 1110

great game in my oppinnion its probally the best military game i ever played graphics are outstanding but the multiplayer was disapointing when i got banned from 80% of the servers after only playing it for a few days  they wouldnt even tell me what i was being accused of and never gave me a warning about anything just random perma ban on most servers very disapointed and sad because i was just getting into the game and having a great time with my new computer i just built to play it 
recommended
an immersive fps that includes realistic strategy and awesome battles with a range of weponary stunning visuals and gameplay 1010 from me
recommended
good game but if you have a old computer it runs very slow 
recommended
i try to jump up a rock and boom im stuck inside it 1110
recommended
an incredible game for anyone that likes realism more than run and gun style gameplay the only downside is its very picky about the server side of things and some gamemodes or servers will bring down the client fps to unplayable levels <25 fps
recommended
first arma game i have bought and boy is it fun if you ever get bored of the vanilla game there are plenty of multiplayer mods that can keep you entretained for more than a while
recommended
this game has one of the most powerful graphics that has been seen in any game so far in a fps and survival etc game no screen tearing hardly any graphics problems on terrain or sky etc this game is a 9510 game and will beat the bf4 and cod series if the developers concentrate on this game for the long term run
recommended
i love this game too bits but i would not spend the original prize fund i would defo get this when its on sale but this game is awesome tons of mods nice community overall 910
recommended
this game is an total masterpiece its the closest you can ever get with trying to remake a millitary simulation game i say buy it you wont get dissapointed and you even have tons of awesome mods like a dayz arma 3 mod epoch  which looks and plays even better than dayz standalone itself you have base building mechanics tons of weapons and best of all  you can play on player made maps and dont make me even start talking about arma 3 battle royale yeah and btw the game runs much better on intel cpus than on amd cpus especially in mulitplayer
recommended
arma 3 successor of arma 2 and arma 2  oa is in my opinion the best arma game yet released arma was always known for its moddabillity and the users freedom to create their own missions since bohemia interactive released arma 3 tools modding became even more easy there are many really good mods out there some are as good and big as a whole dlc the game without mods is also good of course the campaign was well designed and there are many fun multiplayer missions which you dont need mods for only few actually need modseveryone who played arma 2 or any other arma game and liked it for its tactical depth its moddabillity all the multiplayer missions or for whatever reason this game is defenitely worth its money a note to all dayz fans  dayz epoch the most popular dayzmod version since somewhere in 2013 i think is comming out for arma 3 somewhen at least they announced it only closed alpha when i last checked tldr  a good game 
recommended
if you dont have this game  you better kill yourself it wonderful game with open world never end
recommended
arma 3 is an excellent military sandbox you dont buy it for the singleplayer you buy it for the community mods and addons you could really never run out of things to try or play

great game for anybody sick of the run and gun play style of cod battlefield and so on the editor is fun and easy to understand the multiplayer is a bit laggy but other than that perfect the community in arma is the best i have seen in any game and i think you should join it
recommended
not a great game but a great community ok the game is great as well

arma 3 is a military simulator its not supposed to be played like call of duty or battlefield where you run and gun but you most certainly can it helps to play this game with other people because the ai isnt very helpful there is also the problem with bugs that come with any arma game you will break your legs from running around you will get trapped in the world and you will get stuck doing simple actions you will also love every minute of it when you learn how to deal with these issues the game is an absolute blastthe draw of the game isnt the base game it is the mods just like arma 2 this game will have a long lifespan because of mods like arma life epoch battle royale breaking point just to name a few just be sure before to watch some videos or read the instructions on various websites before you mod the game so that you dont have to reinstall your game or spend hours trying to figure out what you did wrong 910 would fly a helicopter into a tank again bring a friend but please fix the annoying bugs

almost a perfect infantry combat experience the peripheries arent quite polished especially air combat and there is a lack of content in the base game but the ability to make mods for this game is what really makes it shine overall i give this game a 910

this is a great step up from arma 2 they did take an odd turn and remove most weapons from the base game to get people to buy additional dlc beyond that the new graphics introduced is a nice update to the game that introduces working screens and a cleaner look the arma physics for vehicles that used to be a riot when in a wheeled vehicle has been largely updated and has less vehicles flying 200 ft into the air all in all a great game to play with friends or even random people to get your tactics on

i have to say this game blew me away the first i tried it heres what i think of the game pros realistic if you get shot twice your dead no regenerative health editor allowing you to create your own missions hard combat makes you think on how to complete said missions you dont always have to be the commander or even fight multiplayer gameplay can be intense and make you think even more than against the ai makes you work with your team to actually get stuff done actual terminal ballistics booming mod community cons hard to learn controls if new to series some minor bugs this will go away hopefully after beta so im not taking a point away for it i cant think of any more so overall i give this game a 1010 edit just thought of 1 problem that affects a lot of people optimization issues new score 8510

my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game ever were on our way to the objective a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces im leading a team of 4 men we come to a crossroad and i sprint across telling my men to hold back i cross a few more times trying to get a response from any snipers nothing i run my lmg gunner runs my medic runs but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through remember the sniper scene the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down he then takes two more in the chest the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills he played it up to 11 here he screams as hes being shot crawling drenched in his own blood sarge you aint leaving me out here like this right ii wanna go with you guys cmon sarge hhelp me cmon please dont leave me he died after that i cried and he respawned 1110 would recommend getting

this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things having done both military service and picked up milsim airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality there are experiences you will have in arma 3 that can not be had in cod or bf experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release one that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower i was squad leader of 8 or so ais as we approached the comms tower and i told my men to go stealth no firing unless fired upon we moved slowly taking advantage of terrain keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and i spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower there i positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as i had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower i considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position but a firefight is always a risk and these ai had been around for a few missions and i had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly i might get hit and killed as i considered how i would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern i realised the tower is unguarded and i had an opportunity to do something i had not considered i got up and ran as fast as i could towards the tower all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head i kept scanning as i ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols after what seemed like far too long i reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention i turned around and made my way back as i closed on my men i started ordering them to fall back hope growing that i might get out of this alive falling back to about 400 meters i finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to command i had done it i had pulled off the perfect mission not a shot fired and all under my command back alive that is what this game is about

oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter as it is so so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning the gameplay is excellent the mechanics are solid and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series as i was may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fpsshooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief brutal and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no minimaps no enemy ui iconsindicators no hit markers no health bars if you get shot a couple of times you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness cover teamwork suppressive fire and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles armor helicopters and planes each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts each containing 1215 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding and challenging i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete however the singleplayer campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer oh god the multiplayer wasteland king of the hill invade and annex battle royale breaking point so many coop opportunities the amazing looking upcoming epoch currently in closed alpha im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later if you do not find my review helpful please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback

this is quite possibly the most emotional shooter ive ever played and its not because of the campaign crowd around children its story time one day not so long ago my squad had just destroyed an antiair battery our pilot landed and the rest of the squad boarded one by one i was about to get in when the rockets started flying the chopper lifted off with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes unwilling to die before then i rushed to the nearest cover a small house by a narrow road i entered to find a ten yearold player who had also been left behind he explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his clan i politely declined explaining that my own squad was inbound as i finished a ghost hawk flew over the horizon my squad had arrived this noble child soldier and i were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting the sniper screamed as a 65 mm cartridge entered his leg his shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as i climbed in the transport my new friend was dead 1010 would experience survivor guilt again

cant tell you if you should buy it or not but i can tell you this you will find annoying bugs highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have but when you really get down to it and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission its something magical you just cant find in any other game arma is not a game which you pick up at launch play the campaign and a bit of mp and then trow away you buy it love it or hate it and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly arma is a game which you can never called finished there will always be added to it be it user or official content fixes features or optimizations hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it  if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare this will be your gem ill give it a 910 simply because screw bugs ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back read i will not accept random friend requests if you have a question please post it in the comments

its not a good game for newbies no its not i use to sit at a place and watch the sunset i have no idea how to actually shoot drive and complete missions its like my personal sunset simulator and its damn beautiful 1010

i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 1020 minutes in a single location sometimes longer i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible unless doing paintballing or airgunning and if you do buy the game  i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game

this game is well worth the cash it has a pretty hefty price tag i know but the gameplay is amazing i cant describe how beautiful the game is even with a lower setting with ultra the game is just gorgeous arma 3 is so well optimized you could be playing from medium to high in almost any decent rig the number of things you can do in this game is almost unlimited from tactical ground combat to flying multiple cas & aa jets not to mention various helicopters that come in civilian armed or plain gunships are really fun with friends tanks ranging from high armor and huge  guns to lighter anti air tanks armored vehicles such as apcs to trucks equipped with fully automatic grenade launchers theres so many things you can do at almost any time having to master your flying skills to shoot down another jet or getting a kill 1100 meters away with a 50 cal sniper rifle gives you a surreal feeling and is indeed very rewarding this game takes patience and with time and practice it will give you lot of satisfaction further more if for whatever reason you dislike the gameplay or get bored which is highly unlikely especially with friends remember that this game has an active community who constantly makes multiple mods of almost any genre all available for free at anytime zombies may interest you if you have moved from dayz or the dayz mod from arma 2 in which both can be replaced with much better graphics and gameplay 1010 a must have game in your library
recommended
for me this was in my list of one of those legendary releases of 2013 this is a perfect game for an opensandbox reaslitic military shooter and has numerous gamemodes instead of just being the typical army type firstperson shooter where you just do a mission shoot and its over one thing is to make sure you have a great gaming rig because this is a very demanding game and is still going through some updates to increase optimization

one of the only game where i spent more time on the graphic settings for optimal 60fps and training in the tutorial than actually playing the game aside that the control are smoother than arma 2 and feels more optimized but the content is still lacking it become a great game if one get invested in it otherwise pass your way if you expect playing it like a regular fps with wasd and left click youll become a machinist on your keyboard

as a veteran arma 2 player i can help you decide whether if you want this or not first of all you need a decent pc i bought this game in alpha but my pc is kinda old and while arma2 runs pretty well on medium graphics this one lags the sht out of my soul second you have to find a good community example unitedoperations who schedule events and has basic rules teamspeak is a must have app etc third you need a lot of time you have to learn the game you have to learn how to communicate with teammates and ofcourse you have to learn to obey your commander a normal coop mission could take up even to 2 hours yes 2 hours of gameplay and sometimes even without firing your weapon or you get shot in the beginning and you can spectate how other guys play against ai this game needs a higher level of will and commitment i think these high specs are bad for the game since players who love these realistic simulations are already a few but if you take out those who dont have good enough pcs for the game you get a really really small community i am still thinking about buying a new pc but this game is not my main game at all and i think there are a lot of other players who think like me i cant say anything about singleplayer since i think it is not fun at all if you have a good pc and a good community it can turn out to be a 910 game if you have a good pc and a badno community it can turn out to be a 510 game if you have a bad pc community doesnt matter it is a 210 game

yes i do recomment this game
recommended
the best game so far
recommended
sure there are bugs many bugs but the bottom line is that arma 3 improves in almost every department over the second game well worth the dollar

pros great game with tons of mods and gamemodes the community is huge and there is always going to be players graphics are simply beautiful cons game is unoptimized game may initially be overwhelming to newcomers of the series lack of more indepth audio options may be a turnoff for us 71 surround users or those who just want a greater level of control my review your experience and mileage may vary depending on what you do with arma 3 you can go all vanilla and play campaign or simple multiplayer or you can go with the huge modding community the mods are really what make this game great not in the mood for simple deathmatch play king of the hill with 120 players not in the mood for that try epoch or survival the gameplay is solid and the experience is worth it there is only one con and it may affect you depending on how you like to experience games you are more than likely not going to get 60 fps in this game and probably will be hard to get a solid 30 without the occasional dips this game is highly unoptimized on multiplayer the game runs fine with single player campaign but with multiplayer the netcode is completely weird some mods i can get 60 fps in some i can barely hit 30 regardless if i run on ultra or minimum settings you will only usually have the same fps the server has this was a big problem initially then i just got past it the gameplay more than makes up for it and the experience is more about the community hopefully this will be rectified soon however i highly doubt it especially if you look at dayz audio customization is a problem i have in particular also with all the customization arma 3 allows with the interface they barely have any settings for audio mostly just the general master chat etc i wish i could choose which sounds levels i could adjust i bought this game with the intention of playing epoch since dayz latest update ruined everything i liked about the game and in the end i barely play epoch mostly survival and king of the hill great gametypes and i also highly recommend atlis life in arma 3s current state i would rate it a 710

the newest game in the arma series from bohemia interactive offers a wide variety of new vehicles weapons and gameplay options if you like wargames but want something a bit more realistic than cod arma iii is for you

huge open world sandbox multiplayer desyncs a lot too many kill trades online the content is created by users so there is not that many good missions or multiplayer modes theres is about 3 main modes that people play king of the hill wasteland and altis life this is still a great buy and many people are working on creating new missions and improving current missions warning there appears to be a high number of squeaky kids considering how kids usually are into more casual games must be all the day z fuzz arma has gotten into
recommended
im not going to pay this money for this game  totally not you shouldnt 1st you should get a better gpu and i mean a very good gpu arma 3 still needs better optimization 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes it still has some desync insues here and there multiplayer performance needs improvement 3rd why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play singleplayer  well arma is made for coop action and by this i mean join a clan group unit that knows how to play the game correctly 4th buy it and you will see it will be worth it
recommended
this game its game that is really worth buying if you like tactical gameplay or just messing around and create everything you want in the zeus mode or create a mission that you can public on the steam workshop or play it yourself also this game has a a lot of mods that you can use and have fun with and with these mods like epoch arma becomes a survival game or with altis life it becomes a rpg the only bad thing about arma is that it has a lot of bugs that bohemia interactive is still fixing but i still love itand i hope that you guys enjoy it too

i started of playing arma 2 but came out somewhat frustrated because of the controls and interface the game explored new concepts but was not an enjoyable or intuitive interace arma 3 and a completley different expirience for me the game still looked and felt like arma 2 but they have fixed my few problems that i had with the previos game making probebly the best expirience in a game ive had in a long time the map armory 2 by happy comedy makes the game easier to learn alowing players to test out vehiclels a must have map the 60 dollar price point can turn people off but trust me if you are looking for vehiclels guns boats scuba diving drones tanks cars planes helicopters and a @$% ton of amazing and cool mods this game is definitly for you fuze
recommended
really cool game if you are used to shooter games it is very intense and realistic you can get killed pretty quickly and vehicles can blow up easy also the maps are very beautiful and great to explore with lots of hiding spots arma 3 has a large range of weapons that can suit all playing styles so i highly recomend it for people who are reasonalbly experienced at shooter games

for the first time in the series the official campaign is actually playable and enjoyable play it before they break it with patches was my thought on the first episode the second episode is filled with uninspired generic missions that dont even have an aim unlike the first episode where you could obviously tell what element each mission is trying to introduce the story too is nonexistent here its basically just repeating the point that the first episode already established repeating the same thing is completely fine in storytelling but thats only if you havent repeated it enough times yet whats repeated in the second episode has already been repeated just the right amount in the first episode to the surprise of no one the third episode is even more uninspired and boring the missions in the third episode dont contain a single unique idea unlike the second episode which has a fistful of those whats worse the story is absolute garbage everything interesting happens offscreen and the game doesnt even give answers to the questions it raised itself while giving answers to the questions that didnt exist until that point it doesnt even have a conclusion and ends in an abrupt cliffhanger its the definition of trash all episodes combined the campaign doesnt even use 18 of the interesting locations in altis and stratis for some strange reason even after the introductory first episode there are so many missions that take place in stratis which is fairly small if they make sense in the story standpoint thats fine but they dont all of those would have been totally alright to take place in altis so it doesnt make any sense also the missions in altis take place in very boring locations even though there are tons of varied locations eg huge town stadium ghost hotel airport vast desert mountain full of windmills they only use the same type of locations small town even worse the third episode takes place entirely around a single town neochori why did they decide to do that well never know the game itself is fine though and thats what matters in the end

my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game ever were on our way to the objective a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces im leading a team of 4 men we come to a crossroad and i sprint across telling my men to hold back i cross a few more times trying to get a response from any snipers nothing i run my lmg gunner runs my medic runs but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through remember the sniper scene the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down he then takes two more in the chest the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills he played it up to 11 here he screams as hes being shot crawling drenched in his own blood sarge you aint leaving me out here like this right ii wanna go with you guys cmon sarge hhelp me cmon please dont leave me he died after that i cried and he respawned 1110 would recommend getting

this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things having done both military service and picked up milsim airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality there are experiences you will have in arma 3 that can not be had in cod or bf experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release one that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower i was squad leader of 8 or so ais as we approached the comms tower and i told my men to go stealth no firing unless fired upon we moved slowly taking advantage of terrain keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and i spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower there i positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as i had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower i considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position but a firefight is always a risk and these ai had been around for a few missions and i had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly i might get hit and killed as i considered how i would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern i realised the tower is unguarded and i had an opportunity to do something i had not considered i got up and ran as fast as i could towards the tower all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head i kept scanning as i ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols after what seemed like far too long i reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention i turned around and made my way back as i closed on my men i started ordering them to fall back hope growing that i might get out of this alive falling back to about 400 meters i finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to command i had done it i had pulled off the perfect mission not a shot fired and all under my command back alive that is what this game is about

oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter as it is so so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning the gameplay is excellent the mechanics are solid and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series as i was may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fpsshooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief brutal and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no minimaps no enemy ui iconsindicators no hit markers no health bars if you get shot a couple of times you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness cover teamwork suppressive fire and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles armor helicopters and planes each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts each containing 1215 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding and challenging i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete however the singleplayer campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer oh god the multiplayer wasteland king of the hill invade and annex battle royale breaking point so many coop opportunities the amazing looking upcoming epoch currently in closed alpha im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later if you do not find my review helpful please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback

this is quite possibly the most emotional shooter ive ever played and its not because of the campaign crowd around children its story time one day not so long ago my squad had just destroyed an antiair battery our pilot landed and the rest of the squad boarded one by one i was about to get in when the rockets started flying the chopper lifted off with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes unwilling to die before then i rushed to the nearest cover a small house by a narrow road i entered to find a ten yearold player who had also been left behind he explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his clan i politely declined explaining that my own squad was inbound as i finished a ghost hawk flew over the horizon my squad had arrived this noble child soldier and i were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting the sniper screamed as a 65 mm cartridge entered his leg his shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as i climbed in the transport my new friend was dead 1010 would experience survivor guilt again

cant tell you if you should buy it or not but i can tell you this you will find annoying bugs highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have but when you really get down to it and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission its something magical you just cant find in any other game arma is not a game which you pick up at launch play the campaign and a bit of mp and then trow away you buy it love it or hate it and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly arma is a game which you can never called finished there will always be added to it be it user or official content fixes features or optimizations hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it  if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare this will be your gem ill give it a 910 simply because screw bugs ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back read i will not accept random friend requests if you have a question please post it in the comments

its not a good game for newbies no its not i use to sit at a place and watch the sunset i have no idea how to actually shoot drive and complete missions its like my personal sunset simulator and its damn beautiful 1010

i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 1020 minutes in a single location sometimes longer i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible unless doing paintballing or airgunning and if you do buy the game  i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game

i like this game i played my first fps years ago starting with doom and at that time i was blown away and could never of dreamed of anything better boy was i wrong the next game to capture my imagination was meadal of honour and the single player world captured my imagination and heart with meadal of honour came the first real multiplayer action that i enjoyed and i couldnt stop playing next game to follow was call of duty a great series of games that offered plenty of run and gun action great stuff the progression to battlefield for a more indepth experience blew what came before away now battlefield looked to offer with its later installments a more realistic battle experience but it fails infantry are fine but the vehicleswhich look greatin my opinion start to ruin the game series that brings me to arma 3 wow  once again i am blown away and once again what came before falls into history animations lighting movment and the environment are a dream come true this is a truely epic game

recommended
all around excellent game the campaign was very well put together the graphics are amazing the combat very realistic and the squad movements are very realistic it does take some time to get used to all the various controls there are a lot of them but once you figure it out you can move your squad through any level with ease and destroy everyone along the way the mod content is getting better everyday if you like quick pvp then wasteland and the battle royale mods are great for that currently they have a dayz version of arma3 called breaking point that is an independent spinoff that is also quite fun i personally cannot wait for the arma3 epoch dayz to come out because i have played the arma2 mods for a while now there is also altis life and lakeside if youre into the rp scene but that is all preference overall its a well put together simulator that exmilitary which i am or civilian with no experience can learn to enjoy and appreciate mb

this is a very immersive game with high attention to detail and a seemingly limitless amout of possibilities every peice of your gear is changeable i mean sht you can run around the battlefield in nothing but your underwear and a tshirt if you so please you can change your camo and helmet and lbv and backpack and every other thing you carry everything that is in your inventory can be dropped or moved from bag to lbv or pants shirt pocketsand viceversa it provides a very similar experience to hardcore milsim airsoft if thats what youre into i am into airsoft without the hey call your hits or hey are you dead bs you are even able to create your own missions somewhat easily with the ingame mission editor anyway i figured id share one of my most memorable experiences in any operation in arma or any game out there i was playing on a mission that i created on stratisone of the in game maps i was leading a 10 man assault on air station mike 26 we were all riding in an apc my gunner was doing great taking out ground troops and even took out an ifrit or two out of nowhere an enemy hit the apc we were in popping all left side tires stoping it dead in its tracks i immidiately got out and threw a smoke grenade to either side and told my men to disembark unfortunately only 2 men made it out before the apc exploded in that same explosion the 2 men that had made it out were killed worried i threw one more smoke grenade and waited for the smoke plume to build and ran straight back behind a small hill dodging what seemed like the bullets from 1000 angry hostiles once behind the hill i healed my self and radioed in for a helicopter extraction i waited and waited until the heli showed up all i could hear above me were the screams of the miniguns that the 2 door gunners were operating and the swooping of the rotor the heli flew right over my head and began to circle around the base taking out enemy after enemy i knew the helicopter would not last long as it was simply a helicopter meant for extraction and not any sort of combat so i called in an attack heli for some added assistance after the attack heli started to engage targets i sprinted inside the base behind a large hbarrier i could see lots of enemies i quickly engaged one enemy and started to advance to another hbarrier when i was hit i quickly went prone and healed up and threw my last smoke grenade inside the base after about 10 seconds of letting the smoke build i ran up to a building and began to take out target after target in some sort of spec ops manneryeah i was that good i ran around the base with the supressive fire of the helicopters and cleared the entire base of any threat after i called in the evac heli and flew myself back to base because the pilot was killed on landing because my area clearing is garbage it was quite the experience to get the juices flowing this game never fails to impress and i still find myself learning new things about it every day

if you like tactical realism theres no other game better than this one 100% recomended

pretty awesome loads of mods and sweet singleplayer plus battle royale or dayz this game is easily worth the 60 you pay with the immersive gameplay and treating it like real life you will feel and act like it is war and thats what sold me on this unique game now if they could have put it on sale before i bought it that would have been nice

710 single player is fine mods can make sp a fun experience but once you try mp thats a solid no unless you play wasteland or on a private server the fps on any server running a custom game mode is terrible it is higly unlikely you will get above 30 fps on a public server i cant speak for private servers but if you want to play mp play wasteland or find a group that has their own notbad private server only recommended because of sp

awesome  have only played a few minutes of the single player npc asked me to shoot the medic wtf  but 50 hours of altis life mod has me hooked not since the early gta games have i experienced the wonder of an enormous game world add the pvp elements from dayz and a thriving community its the best thing going

all around excellent game the campaign was very well put together the graphics are amazing the combat very realistic and the squad movements are very realistic it does take some time to get used to all the various controls there are a lot of them but once you figure it out you can move your squad through any level with ease and destroy everyone along the way the mod content is getting better everyday if you like quick pvp then wasteland and the battle royale mods are great for that currently they have a dayz version of arma3 called breaking point that is an independent spinoff that is also quite fun i personally cannot wait for the arma3 epoch dayz to come out because i have played the arma2 mods for a while now there is also altis life and lakeside if youre into the rp scene but that is all preference overall its a well put together simulator that exmilitary which i am or civilian with no experience can learn to enjoy and appreciate mb

this is a very immersive game with high attention to detail and a seemingly limitless amout of possibilities every peice of your gear is changeable i mean sht you can run around the battlefield in nothing but your underwear and a tshirt if you so please you can change your camo and helmet and lbv and backpack and every other thing you carry everything that is in your inventory can be dropped or moved from bag to lbv or pants shirt pocketsand viceversa it provides a very similar experience to hardcore milsim airsoft if thats what youre into i am into airsoft without the hey call your hits or hey are you dead bs you are even able to create your own missions somewhat easily with the ingame mission editor anyway i figured id share one of my most memorable experiences in any operation in arma or any game out there i was playing on a mission that i created on stratisone of the in game maps i was leading a 10 man assault on air station mike 26 we were all riding in an apc my gunner was doing great taking out ground troops and even took out an ifrit or two out of nowhere an enemy hit the apc we were in popping all left side tires stoping it dead in its tracks i immidiately got out and threw a smoke grenade to either side and told my men to disembark unfortunately only 2 men made it out before the apc exploded in that same explosion the 2 men that had made it out were killed worried i threw one more smoke grenade and waited for the smoke plume to build and ran straight back behind a small hill dodging what seemed like the bullets from 1000 angry hostiles once behind the hill i healed my self and radioed in for a helicopter extraction i waited and waited until the heli showed up all i could hear above me were the screams of the miniguns that the 2 door gunners were operating and the swooping of the rotor the heli flew right over my head and began to circle around the base taking out enemy after enemy i knew the helicopter would not last long as it was simply a helicopter meant for extraction and not any sort of combat so i called in an attack heli for some added assistance after the attack heli started to engage targets i sprinted inside the base behind a large hbarrier i could see lots of enemies i quickly engaged one enemy and started to advance to another hbarrier when i was hit i quickly went prone and healed up and threw my last smoke grenade inside the base after about 10 seconds of letting the smoke build i ran up to a building and began to take out target after target in some sort of spec ops manneryeah i was that good i ran around the base with the supressive fire of the helicopters and cleared the entire base of any threat after i called in the evac heli and flew myself back to base because the pilot was killed on landing because my area clearing is garbage it was quite the experience to get the juices flowing this game never fails to impress and i still find myself learning new things about it every day
recommended
if you like tactical realism theres no other game better than this one 100% recomended
recommended
pretty awesome loads of mods and sweet singleplayer plus battle royale or dayz this game is easily worth the 60 you pay with the immersive gameplay and treating it like real life you will feel and act like it is war and thats what sold me on this unique game now if they could have put it on sale before i bought it that would have been nice

nice shoot d

arma isnt like codbf its more like gta but more realistic i mean you dont rly steel ppls cars you need a keylockpick to the car and its not that easy to get money either to get money u have to like pick apples or sell weed it was boring when i started to play this game but it did become funnier and funnier every time to play this game u need a lot of time i say

arma 3 is a miltary simulator through and through but unlike most simulators arma 3 has a campaign with indepth story to boot and competitive mp thats more then decent the ai is of a standard above what most games have to offer out there and each weapon ground or aireal vehicle strive to give as realistic experience as can do when operating said equipment weapons need to be zeroised and as per actual warfair artillery or mortars need to be given a grid reference gr before effective fire can be achieved and you yourself can operate fire support weapons the campaign is set into episodes and each episode has just below ten missions that offer a challenge in every aspect although your ai teammates need to be babysitted somewhat and the game could use some more optimisation but thats a small price to pay in a game that is overall great i score this game a 8510

very high quality outranks cod battlefield and moh in my book

i love this gameits make me feel like a solider in a big very big battlefield

this game is great even though it currently has some interface issues the gameplay is awesome the mods and different gamemods keep you playing for hours on end and the graphics look almost real as you see each individual piece of grass sway in the wind if you like war simulation games then im sure you will probably get your moneys worth out of this
recommended
awesome get it
recommended
yes i recommended this game but its not that great this is only my oppinion to me the game is ok i guess but it has a lot of bugs also its not that fun the game would be more worth it if it was about 25 bucks but nooooo it has to be super expensive yes the game looks nice but it didnt change at all from arma 2 again not worth it well if your into this kind of game go ahead and buy it don t let me stop you but if you are not that into super hard core serious games than i suggest you dont get it its a waste of money
recommended
alpha was fun beta was fun release was fun 1010 open world military infantry sim loving every moment my computer can handle running it

ah alas arma 3 is finally getting the last campaign and the fixed wing vehicles we have been waiting since launch for since launch the game has taken a good 5 steps forward in the right direction adding in the zeus mode will ensure the survival for most hard core coop players with arma being a series relying completely on the community to build machines of war i hope plenty of modders continue to add content to arma 3 the series has proven its worth and i feel the strength of the arma series is just now getting recognized the community is the backbone of the arma franchise so i encourage anyone loyal enough to create ideas the arma community is accepting we accept new players who need help and guidance were not like call of duty where your whole team is a bunch of 10 year old kids calling you names so if you decide after reading this review to buy arma 3 good luck your going to need it
recommended
basically arma 2 with less everything but nicer graphics and less bugs
recommended
its the best

one of the best milsims  combatsims ever made definatly worth the $60

imagine this youre sprinting under heavy fire trees look like turds sand looks like a solid block of chocolate clouds are disabled because your computer cant render them oh baby and those shadowsthat you have to turn off because your game will crash you lay prone and pull out your sidearm suddenly the frames skip the game lags you are shot and killed by a sweaty greasy 40 year old man your game crashes you came all over your pc 1110 much lag very death such unfair ps still is amazing
recommended
a definite upgrade from arma ii the controls act more like pc controls of the 21st century not feeling like your wading through pudding when trying to look strafe etc and the graphics of course are much improved there have been some issues with physx crashes but only from those with amd cards in my experience samatra wasteland alone is reason enough to pick this up the only gripe i really have is that they still have not made the clientserver multithreaded one of the most idiotic things to overlook when the ai calculations and such really make this gameengine heavily cpuintensive if you love realistic shooters without all the killstreak bs and handicapping pick this game up
recommended
amazing game possibly the best game i have ever owned

great game i love realistic fps games like these and cant recommend it enough teamwork and tactics are a necessity
recommended
the best realistic simulation shooter
recommended
military simulator tons of community content flexible modding still some bugs that needs fixing though 8510  highly recommended
recommended
this is a deep and engrossing game really id say its less of a game and more of a simulation framework you can tell its grounded in real world military simulation by the lack of training wheels good support from the developer and community there is some epic content here if you are willing to put in the time new releases constantly improve the core and add additional content at first i was put off by the future world setting coming from arma 2 and expecting something more grounded in todays tech but this game is growing on me and seems like an improvement in every respect have not had any performance issues as of yet but i went out and bought a new graphics adapter solely for this im not disappointed
recommended
an excellent addition to the series some of the most fun ive had in any game would be in the arma series of course you could play it as a sim but the most fun is not taking the game seriously and just having a good time a
recommended
the game is awesome and i really love it beware of the fact that its more sim than an fps it is hard and it will kick your  from time to time if you like a change of combat style mostly slow mid\long range from your normal fps try this you wil love it
recommended
one of the most realistic military tactical shooters
recommended
like arma 2 got to be the best game aroundforget battlefield and cod just buy this you wont be disappointed
recommended
everyone need to try out this game
recommended
this game is awesome and really realistic with cool graphics good job
recommended
if you liked arma 2 you will like this game if you havnt played an arma game i would definatly recomend watching a few videos to see what its like personally i would give it a 910
recommended
this is the best millitary simulator since operation flashpoin game play takes in account many aspect of real world millitary scenario complex operations or just a simple single missions with tons of inventory and vehicles
recommended
fun game when you have a group going i would definitely suggest checking out the workshop as there are some quality missions for team play

9510 when people finaly realise that callofduty is not a real war game i think they sould play this or battlefield but enyways this game is a great way to either play sirius or not its fun either way i highly sugest it i personaly love atlis lifewastelands abd patrol ops so if you want a realy great multiplayer game buy thisor if your want a great war experience play the singleplayer its probably the best singleplayer ive ever played on pci hope this helped you dicide if youl be geting it so thanks for reading d

this game is the best armed forces simulator out there its customizability is its strongest point allowing players to create missions and to run these on servers allowing a infinite amount of possible scenarios if you liked arma ii get this if you played battlefield 3 or 4 and thought i like this but i want more realism get this cannot recommend enough

i hope most if not all of the bugs and issues there are fixed through beta and release for an alpha it was very impressive but i feel there is still some work to do to make the game the best it can possibly be and with a price of 1999 $3299   2499 is almost idiotic to pass up i imagine on full release that price will go to the normal price for a new game on steam either 2999 or 3999 so get it while its hot

the base game i would give 80100with all the great mods people put together for it i would give it a 90100 this is due to the fact some of the mods are stillmehto say the least great game overall and highly suggested to realistic shooter enthusiasts
recommended
first thing im getting once its 75% off bless the family sharing and thank you tora pure gem for military sim with nextgen icing on top
recommended
ill be quick and clear im amazed how bohemia interactive has worked on this game and the best is the support it has performing the game every day one of the best things about arma is the modding and people developing it for our delight i fully recommend this game btw for dayz players arma 3 breaking point is great for now better than dayz standalone ea period
recommended
the best game i have ever played in my life 
recommended
the most realistic military simulator that is open to the public that ive seen
recommended
goes great with the breaking point mod way better then dayz
recommended
i bouth this game in alpha for 20 euro now its for 45 euro enjoy
recommended
this game was released as an incomplete game but content is added on a regular basis in a couple of years itll actually be worth the $30 price tags itll be by then i dont recommend it at its current price but overall its a very solid military simulation game
recommended
the unusual real alpha
recommended
to be honest i might go for arma 2 this time i dunno i think it has more besides its cheaper and it has dayz as well nice community both actually but there is something arma 3 has never came up with bikes man i use bike as weapons here real talk what are you going to do when you are out of ammo i till what to do use a bike simple as dat deadly yet convenient
recommended
if your into army  tactical  strategy  coop  then this is the  for you one of my second favourite games as arma 2 still holds my heart but arma 3 comes in second with all the content fun roleplay and just good times and memories you can make
recommended
fantastic shootermilatary sim butstill need to fix mini bugs but they dont really matter d
recommended
best game love th realism of it must buy
recommended
the one and only i can be a soldier without training feel the battlefield keep this game alive
recommended
realistic beautiful and good gameplay experience there are bugs here and there but they usually get fixed the game in my opinion is a bit boring due to it being in the future with nonexisting weapons it is too bad there arent any popular pvp servers though the game looks and feels much better with loads of good mods to it and is extremely fun to play with others
recommended
yes yes yes great game to play with your friends it has a lot of variation

arma 3 is a seminew game that was released in 2013 and it is thriving with players from game modes of team death match king of the hill zombies and roleplay arma 3 has tons of game modes for you to play my absolute favorite game mode is king of the hill where three teams pit themselves off against capturing and holding a point there are vehicles a leveling system and different weaponry and perks all included with a cash system arma 3 is open for modders in the steam workshop and this increases great chances for the game to survive upon the universe of gaming in general modding is perfect for games because players can do the work they can create what they feel is needed what they want to see in a server and what they know is perfect for the community good things great combat tactical combat and meant for strategy not run & gun has steam workshop support and availability great for modders who want to help the arma 3 community out plenty of gamemodes ensuring to keep you endlessly drooling for what may happen next plenty of vehicles large full scale maps with the ability to go inside almost every building destructible enviroments limited to some different entities amazing campaign and tutorial the tutorial kept me entertained for a good while bad things the game has a semisteep learning curve to it some minor bugs like playermodel glitching etc things arnt fully destructable like in the battlefield 4 engine but good enough graphics may seem outdated on some models its abit hard to get into the game as a new player but youll grind into the game eventually neutralities the game requires teamwork and a mic if you want to be involved in so although there are many lonewolfs out there your average pc might be able to handle it it all depends cats enjoy watching you play it atleast mine does you may have tons of fun in this game if you know how to play it in your own special ways wether it is transporting toops via aircraft or by infantry squadsground missions to fullfledged combat in the many suburban towns of the maps in arma 3 overall i do recommend this game to anyone and everyone that is around 14 of age whom can understand how to work things and avoid the sharp learning curve along with that i really do hope that for any of you that have quit the game because of the learning curve to give the game a few more tries as i did this before and i came back loving the game if youd like you can add me and play with me on arma 3 garrys mod tf2 csgo battlefield 4 and many other games that all of you should commonly know if youre an average gamer anyways take care

where to begin ive been a longtime user and fan of bohemia interactives arma and operation flashpoint series since the original operation flashpoint while i have always enjoyed the series there was always somethingmissing some intangible thing that i couldt quite put my finger on but left my experience not entirely fulfilled because of this i wasnt even going to bother with arma 3 however with steams promotion allowing play for free this weekend i thought id try it out i installed it played the tutorial and played some of the showcase missions and campaign missions what do i think well the devs finally get it they finally finally made the game i always wanted since the first operation flashpoint no more herkyjerky animations no more bad bad dialogue theyve overhauled the graphics engine got what sound like to me professional voice actors and they really turned out a topnotch product this is a serious military sim that is unforgiving and pulls no punches you arent some rapidly healing super soldier you get hit youll probably die even if you patch yourself up with a medkit you are still in pain and that is reflected in the gameplay this is a thinking mans military sim this isnt a call of duty or battlefield game this is to first person shooters as microsofts flight simulator is to flying games its amazing on a rig that can run it the graphics are absolutely amazing the weather effects are top notch and its all on a huge huge map and an insanely detailed one at that so far the campaign is quite entertaining if not a little unforgiving my only quibble with arma 3 is that the ai is a little wacky either you find yourself up against eagle eyed super snipers that can see in the dark or complete morons who will stand stock still and fire at you often the ai is fairly good but man once in a while i havent tried multiplayer yet but i cannot wait to give it a shot i would give this game 4 and a half stars out of 5 a nearly perfect military simulation well done bohemia interactive well done
recommended
great game the campaign is supprisingly epic  i dont like campaigns that much  battle royale mod is just amazing to play 3
recommended
good game can flip cars with gokarts
recommended
man max this game out graphically and you are in for quite the treat this game is incredible in the short time i have played it did most of the tutorials and simulators and started campaign mode i absolutely love the realistic way of the shooter if you can even call it that they did plenty of research and work for this simulator and it shows i would recommend this over any other title in the genre any day looking to take a break from the run and gun arma is your answer
recommended
awesome graphic great military simulation have many mode worth to buy 1010
recommended
gameplay 910 graphics 1110 optimization 410 sound & music 710 base content 610 bugs exploits etc 510 overall good game but buggy as hell drove with a tank hit another vehicle got airborne and made frontflips without taking damage booping a rock front wheels broken engine broken 80 health if the developers would fix the issues this game has it would really be the best and most realistic military simulator ever and be worth every single cent i can understand it might be hard to fix the bugs but trying is gold my 2 cents if you should buy it or not if you enjoyed arma ii or like slow paced realistic simulators and can live with the bugs what arent that bad  get it its worth it and its fun this is not cod not bf not anything else this is arma and who cant understand this well sorry for them p

brilliant game can use some help though some bugs are annoying
recommended
the game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that arma 3 is a great game for community development devs out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions bohemia interactive provides in arma 3 many people buy this game just for the amazing addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen arma is intriguing to me because the game is unpredictable games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion there can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with opfor what do you do arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff why would you want to do that i would give this game a 910

arma 3 is a sidescrolling 2d platformer developed by ea in the games main mode competitve you play as one of two factions the terrorists crazed madmen who seek to destroy the world by unleashing ravenous chickens infected with the ebola virus and the counter terrorists who desire to stop the fowl plague armed with $800 and their wits players seek out the various chicken sites and fight over control of the worlds destiny
recommended
for what this game tries to be which is a war simulator it fails misserably at that the movement is clunky the ai is dumb and overpowered as hell so if you get into this game being all like yeah this is what war is like this is realistic and really precise then sorry you need to get out in the real world pall because i dont consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs this game is however one of the funniest games i have ever played with friends the amount of vehicles the guns the destructible enviorment the overall map is not to shabby either if you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that if you get it to play it as a serious war game then id say the clunky motions and faulty ai ruins that emediatly
recommended
i love this game and i wish to have

if you enjoyed codemasters operation flashpoint in 2001 then you will absolutely love arma iii arma iii takes place on two different islands altis & stratis stratis is 19 square kilometers 73 sq km with few roads and rugged forested terrian altis on the other hand is huge at 270 square kilometers 1042 sq mi with lots of roads and terrian of mostly rolling hills however only 5% of the roads on altis are paved there is a lot of detail put in this game including some indigenous fauna such as snakes rabbits goats dogs insects and a wide variety of fish and other sea critters they do not do anything but move around but it adds to the realism did i mention snakes there are a huge number of snakes on altis movement is not restricted meaning you can move anywhere you like including using a rebreather to dive off the coast of either island to investigate ship wrecks just for kicks there are lots of vehicles to choose from both civilian and military weapons ammunition and equipment can be taken from the dead however only take what you can carry during the missions if you put anything in vehicles they will disappear once you return from your required mission or scouting mission you will only be allowed to keep the items you are actually carrying the game includes a singleplayer campaign broken into three episodes survive  8 required missions plus 6 optional scouting missions adapt  9 required missions plus 8 optional scouting missions win  6 required missions no optional scouting missions when you complete the first required mission for each episode return to base and told to report in  dont if you report in then you will be assigned the next required mission instead go to where a group of your fellow soldiers are standingsitting and listen to what they have to say this is how you get optional missions then go off on a scouting patrol to complete the mission if you so desire when you have completed your scouting missions then return to base and report in for your next required mission all the missions except for the last one are linear and static meaning nothing you do will change the course of events except for the last mission in the last mission you have to make a decision and that decision will determine the outcome of the mission there is a steep learning curve and that can get a little frustrating at the beginning if you are new to arma iii then i recommend enabling the save games in the game options settings and save often to help alleviate that frustration the survive missions are all solo so you have time to adapt and learn the controls the adapt and win missions team you up with a fireteam at your command by the time you complete the campaign 30 hours you should be familiar with giving your fireteam commands both individually and as a group arma iii is more than just a firstpersonshooter it is a firstperson combat simulator the weight of your equipment is taken into consideration and will effect your movement and endurance the three different stances prone crouching and standing will effect how much your weapon recoils which will effect how quickly you can target an enemy standing while trying to hit a moving target at 1000 meters is not recommended arma iii allows userdeveloped mods and also includes dlcs once you have completed the campaign and want more singleplayer or multiplayer campaigns then i recommend subscribing to the dynamic universal war system in the steam workshop the duws mod will randomly create new campaigns with as many missions as you desire the goal of the campaign is always the same  control of the island there are still some minor bugs that need to be worked out but it is very playable as is i definitely recommend arma iii
recommended
good fun game with lots to do

arma 3 is an interesting game with all the god awful driving physics for the trucks but hey lets get past that one con arma 3 in general is a frun game but when you have friends that play it when i first bought arma 3 i played scenarios and got bored as hell in ten seconds flat but when you really get into it and start playing altis life and make a gang with your friends and do all that kind of stuf like my friends and i do all the drug dealing it really hits how the fun this game is and how pretty it is depsite the driving physics 810 realy fun game pros gameplay altis life online multiplayer cons physics single player

my arma story i was a war jornalist for bbc news and i was assigned to report the war efforts of nato forces on stratis when was i was on base i was invited to tag along bravo 11 and they insured me of my safety so we hoped on the ghosthawk and headed north of the island the men of bravo 11 were very speechless along the ride as if they were getting ready for the worst and this concerned me because what could be worst than getting shot at as we have landed bravo 11 had begun advancing towards a town near the coastal line i try to keep up with them but the smooth task force squad effectively glided every inch of the way as they scan for enemies once weve reached the coast we were already taking shots by enemy fire from over the horizon bravo 11s squad leader callsign toast yelled my name while firing his weapon sayingget to cover i ran towards his safety only because i was in shock and did not know what to do he completely disapproved of my reaction and lead me to the nears wall after a couple of minutes of the violent firefight which felt like hours a loud count down appeared 54321 and a bright white flash blinded us boooooooooooooommmm a nuclear missile explosion a large mushroom cloud had risen into the sky causing and blocking the sun everything was so shocking and sudden all communications were just filled with confusion luckliy we were far away enough from the blast zone finally the mushroom cloud had disappeared and we were ordered back to homebase for a debriefing thanks bravo11 and toast for the great online cinematic ride from paddington

arma 3 is the most recent edition to the series it is a greatly improved in almost every aspect improvements first of all this game is excellent it is a vast improvement from arma 2 and has less clunky controls runs better performance wise many new features such as scuba diving with underwater shooting cant get to them all steam workshop support and many active players at a time this game also requires a beast of a pc to run it is optimized very well though for the vast open world it is my specificiations are an i5 4690k 8gb of ram gtx 760 superclocked  and i get on average 30 fps on ultra 45 on high and 70 on lowest at 1920x1080 resolution bohemia based games also run better on intel processors usually hmm i really dont have much to say that is bad about this game i do dislike the desync that happens in this game but they have managed to get rid of some of it in this game compared to arma 2 were it would happen alot more frequently also more content please bohemia  tldr good game buy it if you liked arma 2 or you want a realistic combat scenario worth it even at full price

best cod running simulator walk 10 meters start having an asthma attack

arma 3 is an amazing shooter way better then games like call of duty and battlefield 4 it is a must have for anyone that likes shooters but even if you dont like them it has things like altis life arma 3 life not released yet and much much more
recommended
to have fun in this game you must work with your teammates communication makes this game fun or funny youll meet great guys on this game going somewhere alone if the most boring expierence youll have get to that city with all your teammates and find a town to take over plan your assault then execute you might be able to get some good mods on this game too battle royale breaking point that will only expand your game expierence when you first start off your frames will be absolute crap google stuff to find fixes you just have to change some stuff in your game files stick to certain servers too they may be the only ones with good framesthose cool guys you were playing with earlier all in all you gotta trust my review because i only write long reviews for games im passionate about single player creates that epic feel that multiplayer has with a story 810 a little clunky multiplayer epic stuff great community you can let that tactical guy out of you that says tango or hostile instead of enemy 1010 mod support indepth video settings overall 910 game does not deserve to sit in your library and rot
recommended
i have fallin in love with this game altis life is the best mod on this game the roleplay and every situation is diffrent every time i long on the flying driving diving selling drugs taking kindnies robbing  minning and much more the single player is alright but all the mods and the community make up for it
recommended
i think this is one of my best games i have right now my favourite thing is on arma 3 that it is realistic and not like call of duty

when it comes to writing a review for this game i really dont even know what to say this series has always been a go to for me basically since the beginning of my pc gaming days i was playing ofp in 2001 over the years this series has entertained me longer than any other ive ever played there is absolutely no competition to arma no gamesimulator comes even close to what arma has to offer or even comes close to the gameplay experience arma has as any arma veteran knows there is some humps you need to tackle to get use to the game its not a game a where you can just join a server and play like battlefield or red orchestra thats not how the game is structured its not a game where you can play it natively it is not designed in a structured gameplay style whatsoever this isnt a game where you can play by yourself well you could its hard to explain to the averagegamer what this game is about its a platform and if youre playing it without utilizing the very nature of the game is not going to result in the ideal experience you have heard about you need to have a community of players small or large and 3rd party content to form the game into the game you want this platform to be the average content pack is at least 10gb but you should expect 20gb of content the game is designed to be modified arma 3 has no asset content and arma 2 is merely a skeleton of a game body explaining to the average player that they need to download a special program and install 10s of gigabytes of content is difficult it sounds like hard work your average player doesnt want to work to get the game into a playable state thats understandable but thats not what this game is about its so versatile for a reason so groups of people can make the game exactly how they want it its really almost too much to explain all i can say is that if you give this game a chance and you put in the work for the first time around to set it up its amazing it is absolutely unmatched almost every issue you are going to hear about this game comes down to user error if people are complaining about the ai and the futuristic content or the lack of content that is entirely because they are not using the game to its potential if you dont alter the game meant to be altered youre going to have a bad experience the same concept can be applied to performance im sure if youve looked up arma youre probably wondering if you can run it it is true that arma is a heavy game to run but that usually is not the source of the problem 90% of the people complaining about lag are running the game on weak computers that just cannot run arma the game is not considerably unoptimized it does have some networking issues but they are hardly the cause of any major performance problem this is an intensive game 5 years ago you could not even dream to see what arma is providing in a couple years it will be much more easy to run given the boundtohappen advancements in hardware it also comes down to the mission maker and the server hoster if you dont run your servers right you are going to give your players bad performance this game does not babysit you and you should not expect it to if you know what you are doing and you have a decent computer you will run this game with no problem at all i hope you take the time to try it and dont blame everything you are uncapable to do on bohemia there is very few things i can say that have made an impact on my life that arent real maybe 1 other game out of the hundreds that ive played arma is one of those there is some great hilarious experiences in arma that i think i will remember the rest of my real life not many games can do that

overview arma iii such a beatiful game and its also really fun enjoy arma as it is or try out one of its many fantastic mods arma is known for modding in the community along with countless other addons to the game for free the dlc for this game is fantastic and should really be considered when buying the game overall i think arma is a game that needs more contributers and with that we could see many new exciting mods and gameplay that you cant find anywhere else its worth every dollar and even more worth it for the communiy gameplay that can come from it review arma is a beatiful game the graphics are fantastic and all although for $60 price tag you will need alot more than that if you are looking at running the game at a reasonable framerate and trying to insure that the game can look at its finest another fault of this game is the campaign boring and preety much a waste of time and resources by the developers i believe the resources put into the campaign would have helped the multiplayer much more multiplayer what we are all here for right the multiplayer aspect of this game is just briliant is roleplay your thing running away from the cops or getting into high speed pursuits  growing cannabis or mining salt the roleplay game mods have it all or do you think you would enjoy king of the hill on a massive server and trying to control a centre objective with 3 small armys fighting to the last man to take control i do think if you dont already own this game just get it 810

arma 3 is a sidescrolling 2d platformer developed by ea in the games main mode competitve you play as one of two factions the terrorists crazed madmen who seek to destroy the world by unleashing ravenous chickens infected with the ebola virus and the counter terrorists who desire to stop the fowl plague armed with $800 and their wits players seek out the various chicken sites and fight over control of the worlds destiny
recommended
for what this game tries to be which is a war simulator it fails misserably at that the movement is clunky the ai is dumb and overpowered as hell so if you get into this game being all like yeah this is what war is like this is realistic and really precise then sorry you need to get out in the real world pall because i dont consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs this game is however one of the funniest games i have ever played with friends the amount of vehicles the guns the destructible enviorment the overall map is not to shabby either if you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that if you get it to play it as a serious war game then id say the clunky motions and faulty ai ruins that emediatly
recommended
i love this game and i wish to have

if you enjoyed codemasters operation flashpoint in 2001 then you will absolutely love arma iii arma iii takes place on two different islands altis & stratis stratis is 19 square kilometers 73 sq km with few roads and rugged forested terrian altis on the other hand is huge at 270 square kilometers 1042 sq mi with lots of roads and terrian of mostly rolling hills however only 5% of the roads on altis are paved there is a lot of detail put in this game including some indigenous fauna such as snakes rabbits goats dogs insects and a wide variety of fish and other sea critters they do not do anything but move around but it adds to the realism did i mention snakes there are a huge number of snakes on altis movement is not restricted meaning you can move anywhere you like including using a rebreather to dive off the coast of either island to investigate ship wrecks just for kicks there are lots of vehicles to choose from both civilian and military weapons ammunition and equipment can be taken from the dead however only take what you can carry during the missions if you put anything in vehicles they will disappear once you return from your required mission or scouting mission you will only be allowed to keep the items you are actually carrying the game includes a singleplayer campaign broken into three episodes survive  8 required missions plus 6 optional scouting missions adapt  9 required missions plus 8 optional scouting missions win  6 required missions no optional scouting missions when you complete the first required mission for each episode return to base and told to report in  dont if you report in then you will be assigned the next required mission instead go to where a group of your fellow soldiers are standingsitting and listen to what they have to say this is how you get optional missions then go off on a scouting patrol to complete the mission if you so desire when you have completed your scouting missions then return to base and report in for your next required mission all the missions except for the last one are linear and static meaning nothing you do will change the course of events except for the last mission in the last mission you have to make a decision and that decision will determine the outcome of the mission there is a steep learning curve and that can get a little frustrating at the beginning if you are new to arma iii then i recommend enabling the save games in the game options settings and save often to help alleviate that frustration the survive missions are all solo so you have time to adapt and learn the controls the adapt and win missions team you up with a fireteam at your command by the time you complete the campaign 30 hours you should be familiar with giving your fireteam commands both individually and as a group arma iii is more than just a firstpersonshooter it is a firstperson combat simulator the weight of your equipment is taken into consideration and will effect your movement and endurance the three different stances prone crouching and standing will effect how much your weapon recoils which will effect how quickly you can target an enemy standing while trying to hit a moving target at 1000 meters is not recommended arma iii allows userdeveloped mods and also includes dlcs once you have completed the campaign and want more singleplayer or multiplayer campaigns then i recommend subscribing to the dynamic universal war system in the steam workshop the duws mod will randomly create new campaigns with as many missions as you desire the goal of the campaign is always the same  control of the island there are still some minor bugs that need to be worked out but it is very playable as is i definitely recommend arma iii
recommended
good fun game with lots to do

arma 3 is an interesting game with all the god awful driving physics for the trucks but hey lets get past that one con arma 3 in general is a frun game but when you have friends that play it when i first bought arma 3 i played scenarios and got bored as hell in ten seconds flat but when you really get into it and start playing altis life and make a gang with your friends and do all that kind of stuf like my friends and i do all the drug dealing it really hits how the fun this game is and how pretty it is depsite the driving physics 810 realy fun game pros gameplay altis life online multiplayer cons physics single player

i have played 6 hours of this game i absoloutly love it it is a huge leap forward from arma 2 which is still a good game and it has very nice game mechanics and physics if you are part of a big sqquad and useing teamspeak or in game chat this game really delivers on that im my opinion a 98 out of 10
recommended
arma 3 is the most expensive game on steam only people who work at nasa can aford it this is because you require a degree in quantum physics to be able to remember the controls
recommended
such freedom very tactics much stress wow

recommended
i found a car went 140 mph and crashed into a rock 1010 would crash car again
recommended
great successor for the arma series the game itself plus its modded game modes will never get old
recommended
absolutely love this game so far spent hours and hours only on a3wasteland and i have yet to try other mods with friends optimizing the game for good fps is a little tricky considering im running 2x 970s in sli and a 4790k but once you hit the sweetspot in the settings menu you are ready to go like any other games by bohemia interactive it takes a while to grasp the controls and overall feel of the game having previously played over 400 hours of standalone i thoroughly enjoy the vehicle and basebuilding aspects of game modes like a3wasteland atha & daddy which is a hell of an experience when playing in a small or even large group i recommend the [amg] a3wasteland par antha & daddy server as i have enjoyed every second on that server overall 910

this game is hard you jump out of a buildingsplatdead you are walking aroung bangdead you are in a tankmine explodesdead howeveronce you learn all of the tricksabout 75 hours for me it starts to get really rewarding this game is very immersive from the fact that you can shoot enemies from over 2 klicks you can fly helicopters fixed wing and drones you can drive tons of vehicles or you can just walk around as a rifleman use the mission editor to create a mission to your liking download mods to nearly perfect your game ai is kinda glitchy some textures arent perfect but overall fantastic game seriously one of my friends needs to buy this so we can play together

i joined the army i made it momma

i love arma 3 still doing the campaign though but the desynch on multiplayer is horriable everything except for that 1010 so right now i would give it 810

pretty good but very laggy for my pc ill buy the full version once i buy myself a super computer
recommended
amazingly fun i love altis life and wasteland
recommended
get this
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
dont let the screenshots fool you you have to have an amazing computer in order to play like that for most people trying to play the game on the higher settings will result in more lag than game unfortunately on the lower settings the game looks 7 years old graphics aside the gameplay is excellent and realistic like it should be the episodic campaign is the biggest downside it shows quite a bit of laziness on bohemia interactives part its been almost 6 months since the full release and we still dont have the end of the campaign also the campaign isnt very good but multiplayer makes up for it i personally love wasteland and altis life i would recommend purchasing this game primarily for its multiplayer
recommended
9089 i only got this for the dew and doritios package
recommended
not that much my style of game i like altis life 710
recommended
if your into a militarty realismsimulator and have a passion for the balisitcs system play this ing game please you will love it

barbra tree is the greatest wii u racing sim ive ever played the amount of content and side missions is about 5 times as much as every gta combined and the rpg elements really added a whole new level of depth to the game that really made the game stand apart from the other wolfenstein games 1001 piece of crap game i would buy a four pack
recommended
it is a great game well the editor is anyway but the fact they didnt have missions from day one was annoying but still its great to see the missions now but overall i think this is a great and fun game 
recommended
arma that is a soldier and one life lots of helicopters tanks and other things

i love this game
recommended
this is the gripping story of a boy and his beloved dog dog the story takes place in medival us when president nixon was a stablehand in the angarville castle we get an unparralelled experience of frienship and eventually love that transcend boundaries as species and gender truly heartwarming
recommended
arma 3 is very much an improvement on the previous games and i enjoy the smoother combat and animations than arma 2s clunky movement but the optimization issues and bugs still remain although not as heavy as arma 2s it can be a pain to get into games on public servers where everyone just acts like its your typical arcade shooter or the other side where everyone is being a pain by trying to keep it ultra serious and kicking everyone who doesnt say tango down or whatever every two seconds which is why i recommend finding a good group of people like shack tactical to play with but hey you could just ignore it all and play wasteland or arma life servers and never play anything else which is the great thing about gaming anyway hopefully this paints an alright picture in your mind about the game good luck and happy hunting
recommended
great game would recommend for action and rp
recommended
steam took it away from me but i loved it whilst i had it
recommended
very good and enjoyable game however has very bad optimization causing very bad framerates even for many good rigs
recommended
almost as good as cod
recommended
you can run around naked in a fur hat and shoot things whats not to like
recommended
progress is very very slow so its kind of boring but still a pretty good game i guess
recommended
i buy all arma and i not got money to buy this arma  if you want steam you can send me the game for free please i love this game and i really want it from hellokitty meanspring meanset

arma 3 is a brutally hard military sim its not your regular first person shooter this is the platform the military uses to train soldiers because the guns and cover systems are so realistic the ai is unforgiving and if you take even one bullet you are in a world of trouble you get wet or in the cold without the right clothing your going to freeze to death take too much of a fall your going to break your legs you also are not a 1 man army toting around an armarda of weapons you take a side arm and a main weapon with a small ammount of ammo if you have a pack maybe you can fit a spare smaller gun and a few more rounds but the main story is not why most people buy this game arma is a modders wet dream there is a ton of modded game modes the 3 majors ones being arma 3 epoch altis life arma 3 sandbox there are also a good many more in development the game is a little pricey but it does go on sale fairly regularly but if you have a few friends and find a mod you like you have a game that will keep you entertained for a long long time
recommended
fun to play with friends even if youre new to these militairy simulation games editor is so fun to mess around with and the community is one of the best
recommended
arma 3 in summary is simply brilliant there are so many game modes and role playing games which lie within this game to keep you wanting to come back to this game along with a good community which mods and creates more fantastic games and scenarios to play the game looks great and sounds amazing along with the physics to the most part very good and the military simulation is epic and also intense but very fun to plan your strategic tactics to ultimately finish whatever goal you are faced with arma 3 is great alone or with friends you can guarantee that the mass amount of time which you will spend on this game is spent well as the pricing of this game is fairly high arma 3 is addicting and i would recommend this game to anyone 9510
recommended
i really dont like this game i wouldnt recommend it to anyone with a successful life
recommended
great game lots of fun with all the different game types 810 would recommend
recommended
the greatest vehicle simulator
recommended
awesome just awesme if you liked arma 2 you will love arma 3

me and a friend were doing a massive co op mode and we decided to take a quad to the objective later on about 6 km away from the objective the quad breaks so we start walking there we gave up and said screw it and shot eachother  grenaded and my friend was bleeding out so i gave him a medkit then we walked more and the objective changed to about 13 km away and we gave up again so we shot eachother now we are both bleeding out on the ground and stranded in the middle of nowhere until suddenly a friendly tank came moments later and patched us both up then we are inside the tank and i go afk for some juice by the time i got back the tank driver left without giving me nor my friend permission to drive it so my friend brought up that while i was gone a helicopter was here and a guy offered to take us with him my friend said ok but lets wait for my friend to get back being me so when i get back my friend gets in the chopper and said cmon lets get in i was wondering where the pilot is so i got out to find him dead underneath the heli so then me and my friend got out and walked to the nearest air base 2 km away halfway there i realised there was a respawn button so me and my friend used it and spawned at the air base to find dead allys everywhere so we looted them but then the server restarted so we got on gmod 1010
recommended
its pretty damn awsome from gameplay to graphics this game is the bawlz
recommended
i rarely play online and dont do much single player i have no idea how i have 100 hours it must be good
recommended
a little fusterating at first but once you get the hang of its alot of fun i had to rebind some of the keys to make me more comfortable but other then that i love this game
recommended
good campaign exellent graphics fun rp
recommended
i liked the game at first i liked the details i liked the hud i liked the control setup and so on what i did not like though is the fact that it is not that good at multicore rendering so if you have an amd 8core processor then it may lag a little bit for some reason 6core processors work better than 8core processors on this game even if all the cores ahve 4000mhz both on the 6core and 8core
recommended
its a very good game

recommended
this game is awesomly fun when you are completly aware of the situation and focused in on the game i noticed that as soon as i lost that immersion factor i got sloppy with my movements and that often resulted in my demise it can be very frustrating at times especially if you have no idea what you are doing and cant remember many of the controls but once it clicks it gets a little easier definatly do the bootcamp training
recommended
its fun especially altis life d

best warfare simulator out there not only teamwork is a requirement but the knowledge in all vehicles as well as zones weapons pace & victorious beastings on all levels of your senses this is not like cod this is not like battlefield this is a real time warefare simulator you need a pretty sharp machine to run this game at a respectable rate so be aware 910
recommended
this is the perfect game for people who have always taken themselves to seriously when playing shooters and casuals alike its hard to pick up but once you get the hang of the shootsing mechanic and slight lag issues kills become very satisfying
recommended
buy this game or die trying
recommended
great game probably the closest you will get to a military simulator

this game has its moments and it deserves credit for being a great arma game the engine pretty much aint realistic like arma 2 but this game is pretty fun to play with
recommended
such a joy to look at and play especially if you are a fan of the arma series i would also like to point out the breaking point absolutley pisses over dayz standalone breaking point being the arma3 mod that used to be called dayz breaking point on arma2 this is due to having vehicles craftable storage and a  ton of weapons grab it 
recommended
simple best game on the market
recommended
i expected this game to have way more zombies in it 210

you will never play anything like armaperiod i bought this along with arma 2 combined operations i did so only to play various multiplayer mods dayz wasteland etc and then just figured since everyone seemed to love the series that i should have the most recent version as well its safe to say that i have barely played the multiplayer mods and have spent most of the time playing user created scenarios and the standard campaign i am thoroughly impressed with how involved this game is in every possible category furthermore i fully understand now how people become addicted to this game the modding community is the most impressive thing i have ever seen and unlike any other that i have encountered in the pc gaming world there are some things that any newcomer like myself should know before buyiong this first off this game is difficult it is difficult because it is exactly what it says it is a tactical military simulator with focus on infantry do not expect any aspect of casual fps sure you may find that in a user created scenario addon free missions from the steam workshop but most likely not as most fans who create those also focus on the truetolife simulation potential coming from battlefield i figured that this was probably just like bf with a little more tactical realism boy was i wrong but it was a mistake that became welcomed and well received there is so much to learn in this game that it is almost mindblowingit actually only ends up being mindbending the addonsmods seem to be endless since i am still learning how to properly use them i cant speak on the topic with any authority but only know that they are impressive check out the playwithsix launchermod browserinstaller for the arma series along with armaholiccom and get ready for a new never ending obsession

this game is mint tactical gameplay

this game is the most realistic war simulator there is it takes a bit of time to get used to it but then after a while the game gets a bit easier it is a hard game but thats what makes it realistic

love this shooter really fun play
recommended
it is very fun
recommended
i did enjoy the gameplay and story of the game and id definetly play another sequel it was worth the purchase
recommended
arma 3 is a cross between a game and a military simulator it is more complex than the usual bigname games like call of duty and battlefield making the learning curve potentially intimidating for beginners in reality however if you can handle typical fps games you can figure out the basics of arma 3 in about a week the reward of sticking with it is immersion in massive beautiful outdoor environments the smaller island of the two is about 20 km while the larger one is 270 km tactical play and epic encounters there is something different about scrambling for cover as youre being shot at by an enemy patrol and not knowing where its coming from  and then after you find out having to use compass readings to share that knowledge with your teammates its also incredibly fun to take an ai squad under your command close to an enemy position assigning targets to them individually and then ordering them all to open fire at the same time on the unsuspecting soldiers notwithstanding all of this quite possibly the best part of arma 3 is its open nature while youll probably enjoy playing the stock escape missions youll soon discover that there is a treasure trove of custom scenarios created by the community this is one game that is worth the price just for the community creations alone
recommended
this is my favorite game ever it is really fun i rate it a 1010
recommended
over priced
recommended
i recommend playing dayz first as the community taught me all the tips and tricks about playing arma or an arma based mod when i first picked up arma 3 even after staring at the config screen i was still confused and got stuck repeatedly with dayz it kinda progresses you from how to change from first person to third shooting then figuring out how far your target is away so you can compensate for it arma doesnt really teach you that right away thats way i was lost also the campaign in arma what ive played of it is pretty cool aswell as the multiplayer but its big hitter is definetly the mods battle royal atlas life theyre all great and super fun as well as the community i definetly recommend you get this game as there are endless posibilities
recommended
the perfect war sandbox anything from small squad assaults to full war arma3 is one of the few modern games that provides good support for modifications also the regular updates to the game are really nice if you want a little slower paced game than cod with more thinking this is a good game for you
recommended
dis gaem reel bad optimizine but its k cuz i get los of fps so its sweglyf
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played  <3
recommended
this game is not worth it stay with arma 2  arma 3
recommended
arma 3 is a great game especcially game modes such as altis life altis life is a gamemode where you can play as a civilian or rebel and do things like produce cocaine and do high speed persuits away from the police a good server i play on is end days 2172371172302 this is a great server with lots of good role play enjoy it
recommended
this is the most realistic war game in existence at the moment do not buy this game if you enjoy call of duty or other similar shooting galleries this game is hardcore with its precise controls realistic damage model and complicated battles the singleplayer campaign is something to be marveled it blends realistic war with an intriguing story this game is for those who want more from the everyday shooter you must be dedicated if you want to play this game i will easily reccomend this game but only if you know what you are getting into
recommended
although there are many faults to the game which are in the current process of being fixed the game as it stands gives my friends and i endless capabilties through the use of the online community
recommended
bohemias third arma more polished and a lot of things improved from the previous arma 2  sandbox  a lot of weapons vehicles and modifications  big and massive maps  loads of hours to spend  good community  a lot of good and fun player created content if you havent played an arma game before and looking for a more realisticstrategic military war game buy it totally worth it
recommended
if you can get into a god server and have friends that will play with you arma iii is worth the buy
recommended
great sandbox milsim this game is not cod or bf4 it is a sim if you take the time to learn all the controlls you will be rewarded with great gameplay
recommended
very nice game d
recommended
great game
recommended
this game is awesomeballs its so pretty and the guns work well too on top of that the landscapes are huge and pretty the vehicles are probably its only issue since they sometimes feel like jelly
recommended
the game is great and can be played for hours without a break the action is smooth and unforgiving one mistake can lead to half your team being slaughtered in a matter of seconds and a swarm of enemy combatants suppressing your position the epic landscapes that the series is know for is best represented in arma 3 with altis and stratis two mediterranean paradises that have become the setting for a full scale conflict my only qualms with the game is the lack of playable content thus far though the game features three conventional factions and a guerilla faction only two of the factions have full ground capibilities nato and csat leaving the other two at a disadvantage compared with arma 2 combined operations it holds up pretty well another problem that doesnt bother a lot of players but bothers me personally is the lack of a full campaign the only issues that came to mind for me have been noted by bohemia and they are adding the campaign and more content for free i would totally recommend this game if you have any interest in strategic shooters if you liked rainbow six battlefield or even the less popular reboot of operation flashpoint youll find a warm home in the arma 3 community
recommended
this game is great but if your looking for a shooter its not its a military simulator and its just bad @$$
recommended
this game is amazing even though it has some rather big optimization issues i can deffinitely recommend it for something like the wasteland gamemode
recommended
top
recommended
very fun d i like it more than arma 2 mostly because there is swimming underwater 3
recommended
this is a great military simulator the community is a great one and talented therefore giving you great mods to enhance the game
recommended
its pretty intense on the right moments if you want intense firefights you should play dominationl but if you like to play strategic you should also play that lol wasteland on the other hand is boring as  lots of vehicles planes and helis you can bomb  and there lots of weapons 8210 best war simulator of the year pc gamer
recommended
this is a funny game but its small bugs in it  but i recommend this game if you like war simulation games
recommended
one of the best game ever <3 
recommended
the best war simulation game ever
recommended
everybody should buy it you can do almost everything in this game and its really cool as an army simulator
recommended
best shooter game
recommended
arma has gone a long way the game is great but it could still use some more realism still too many glitches and the game still doesnt have that feel to it i do love the game but still could use some improvements from it cant wait to see some more realalistic action packed the game has to offer maybe arma 4 if it happens will bring even more of that and get rid of the robot voices and the big majority of the glitching ai and glitches in general more planes offered by many countries the fa18 fa22 fa35 eurofighter you name it bring in more planes the game has the vehicles and the tanks but not the planes
recommended
one of the most beautiful games ive ever played and one of the most challenging arma iii is an essential game for any wouldbe fps player as it exclusively immerses the player and requires co ordination and immense teamwork i recommend it simply because it is a beautiful game
recommended
i love this game and if you want the intenceness of a real battle but dont want to die  heres your solution
recommended
really fun super tactical awesome when planning pays off 
recommended
this game will lagg if you dont have a good graphics card or have a good hard drive so watch out and have fun
recommended
too long brothers have we suffered mediocrity and have come to lower our standards too much have we become complacent and we have seen aaa games ignore what might have been seen them become recoated year after year taking a franchise and driving it too the ground well no more here we have arma3 a game that stands against the tide and wants to do more be more give more here is a game where you cannot simply walk into mordor or compare it to any other notable shooter mission editors powerful moddable platform amazing graphics as close to realism you can get with regards to weapon and vehicle dynamics incredible maps and attention to detail to name but a few elements that make arma3 great my absolute highest praise for arma 3 for being what they set out to be and not seeying the players as atms tldr you are whats wrong with the world
recommended
love it
recommended
if you like this game than get it
recommended
better than battlefield
recommended
this is an excellent military simulation game that the military bases their own simulator off of this game is hands down the best fps i have played
recommended
its the bombcom
recommended
it calls itself a realistic simulator game and it is great graphics good campaign missions scenarios or showcases full sandbox mode multiplayer wonds affect the player one bad thing is you will never stop looking at the control menu for the first few hours until you figure out what keys you will be using
recommended
i cant play arma 3 its the arma 3 free weekend and its telling me to purchase the game can someone please help me
recommended
buy it for gods sake
recommended
i want this  no  i need this 
recommended
it was feckin amazing i recommend it to everyone but the only downside is you need a good ammount of cpus otherwise you will struggle to get even 10 fps
recommended
seems like a good game only did the training part but seemed good
recommended
i love this game but they should make a free version or make a weekend when u get the game for free for ever cuz 66$ is a lot of money awesome game though played it for two days

well its a pretty expensive game but if youre looking for a fun multiplayer experience with realistic gun damage and accuracy along with tactics this is the game for you
recommended
get this
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
dont let the screenshots fool you you have to have an amazing computer in order to play like that for most people trying to play the game on the higher settings will result in more lag than game unfortunately on the lower settings the game looks 7 years old graphics aside the gameplay is excellent and realistic like it should be the episodic campaign is the biggest downside it shows quite a bit of laziness on bohemia interactives part its been almost 6 months since the full release and we still dont have the end of the campaign also the campaign isnt very good but multiplayer makes up for it i personally love wasteland and altis life i would recommend purchasing this game primarily for its multiplayer
recommended
its fun but there is a problem with bad fps unless you have a super computer
recommended
progress is very very slow so its kind of boring but still a pretty good game i guess
recommended
i buy all arma and i not got money to buy this arma  if you want steam you can send me the game for free please i love this game and i really want it from hellokitty meanspring meanset
recommended
its amazing you can add things to the game better graphics better driving and better hit shooting

recommended
this game is awesome if you like simulation this is a tactical army simulator it has really fun multiplay and a editor where you can create missions and coop missions you can also post your map creation on steam it does not have many mods on the workshop but i dont think it need alot of mods for a cool game like this i totally recommend this for anyone that like shooting games but of course i got my copy on sale for $3899 or around there but thats the digital one i think its called something like that i like this game so much im thinking about doing a series on this game thank you for anyone for taking the time to read this

recommended
good game but it needs pationt and to play with your friends  if you like arma 2  youll like this one
recommended
oh yes this game is everything right with military simulators realistism at its best minus some of the arma physics get it
recommended
its arma although arma 2 is still better in my opinion 1010
recommended
a 10 of 10 amazing game
recommended
arma 3 is very relistic deff not a run and gun type of game but best feature of all is breaking point zombie mod the mod works great
recommended
its a great game for the player who likes realism multiplayer and sandbox games in one deal by far the best military game ive played 1010
recommended
i have to say that this is probably my favorite game of all time im able to spend countless hours in arma iii and still have a great time doing so there are gamemodes that everyone will enjoy and support for modding is pretty good as well i would rate this game a 910 for its awesome action packed gameplay while on mission there is hardly ever a time when im not on edge being aware that the enemy may be anywhere whether you want to play arma iii as tatically as possible in a video game you can if you want to just play casually and shoot some bad guys cause its fun go right ahead you can do that too i overall just love the game and play it mostly multiplayer because although the campaign is great multiplayer is where its really at
recommended
its such a great game just omfg get it now get it now getttt it
recommended
its koolz did u see what i did there i said cool with a k and z
recommended
great game
recommended
yes everyday i play this i just  to the graphics
recommended
this game is brilliant but has decent system requirements i cannot play the game on high settings however i can still enjoy it regardless if you are the kind of person that wants to have the capacity to create an infinite variety of scenarios for yourself as i am this is a great game to play the game is difficult and brutal you can freely make your characters look like a civilian or a hardcore military operative you have a staggering amount of freedom in this game and lots of strategic options involving vehicles including atvs helicopters tanks and even uavs the maps are extremely large and the game does not fail to deliver on any point
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played the realism is outstanding
recommended
fun and has a good comunity backing it
recommended
killed a goat best game ever
recommended
the best war sim out there
recommended
this game is very tactical and makes you think strategically the community is great and the game has almost anything you could want in a military simulator from community made content to extremely detailed maps and weapons 910
recommended
i loved flashpoint dragon rising and red river and i love this too xd

recommended
great game lots of fun with all the different game types 810 would recommend
recommended
amazing army game i really like the designs the weapons and the missions its a great game to play with friends altis life domination and more 
recommended
arma 3 is very much an improvement on the previous games and i enjoy the smoother combat and animations than arma 2s clunky movement but the optimization issues and bugs still remain although not as heavy as arma 2s it can be a pain to get into games on public servers where everyone just acts like its your typical arcade shooter or the other side where everyone is being a pain by trying to keep it ultra serious and kicking everyone who doesnt say tango down or whatever every two seconds which is why i recommend finding a good group of people like shack tactical to play with but hey you could just ignore it all and play wasteland or arma life servers and never play anything else which is the great thing about gaming anyway hopefully this paints an alright picture in your mind about the game good luck and happy hunting
recommended
for me is this the most realistic game ever campain is less boring than in flashpoint and previous arma series for me is main editor you can create what you want you can make funny scenes etc this game is really originally and one of few games what are good for buy authors are looking after this game > thats next reason this is not wasted many 
recommended
it is realy fun i recommend buying it there are mods like wasteland and altis life those are really fun
recommended
this is the most amzing strategy fps war simulation game ever  and i have been playing who knows tones of those type  but here the amazing team bohemia interactive just show again a huge quality and talent behind arma 3 and its dlc  if you like editing this is even better you will never be bored the game is endless and offers you a way to create your own campagn or mission or just simply what you want to be challenged of on a warfield ^^ arma 3 is so far to me the best war game simulation  looking forward to play again  stop reading now and go get it 
recommended
one of the most realistic games i ever played and i played
recommended
downright the best military simulation game everits a must play game highly recommend
recommended
get your arma fix today
recommended
solid 5 minutes of fun
recommended
awesome game with many mods buy this if you like the strategic and tactical side of warfare
recommended
very good game i love it 910
recommended
a better version of arma 2 but needs more content for its price point if you are gonna buy this just to play single player wait but if you wanna fun game you can spend hours blowing your friends up in this is the game for you so in a sense 123
recommended
best military sim
recommended
very nice game for rage d
recommended
the only game i will ever recommend
recommended
easily the best game ive ever played d
recommended
i really tried to give this game the benefit of the doubt  and as you can tell i did buy it  but majority of you would like to know  is this game worth it  well to answer that question  first you must know that this is a military simulation type game  and second is about team work and comunication  just like in real life combat situationsi have to give my kudos to developers at bohemia studios  for embarking into a such ambitious sandbox open world combat game  however the amount of bugs that represents  from graphical bugs  frame studders  and dont even get me started with online multiplayers  the servers are so laggy  that is simply unplayable i understand that guys at bohemia studios are working hard to fix all these issues  but at the moment  this game is only 50% finished  there is still a lot of work to do in order for this game to run smooth i hope this gives you at least an idea  on what you gonna expect when you buy this game  and 5999 is a bit too much to swallow for a game with so many bugs issues  relax bf4 is on that list too  so far the titanfall has the smoothest experience on pc i have high hopes and will support bohemia interactive  studios  cause i like their ideas and they are not afraid to take the risks  so is this game for you well that will depends on what sort of player you are  if you are someone like me  who adores and loves simulations  then yes go ahead get the game  but be prepared for bugs for time being  i think down the road  they will improve the experience but we as community need to help them by reporting bugs and giving them support  i hope this opinion of mine  made you realize my take on this game 
recommended
bath was a spa town
recommended
an aquired taste i have this aquired taste
recommended
arma 3 is one of the best open world games i have ever played it has a wide variety of gamemodes and mods for everyone unlike arma 2 its graphics have hade a massive step up and the first person is a whole lot smoother not like arma 2 choppy first person
recommended
i love this game there is so much you can do with it considering how flexible the simulation is bullet physics are realistic and it is really satisfying when you get that kill i highly reccomend it if you have friends to play with or are looking for a large amount of teamwork because this game is great for that now i just need someone to play with
recommended
i have had this game since alpha and i have now loged over 300 hours in it the amount of things there is to do inside of this game is unreal there are loads of server hosting diffrent mission the arma comunity is very good bring out mods that make the game alot better and adding in some cool stuff the campaign in this game is one of the best ones i have played in years how it is planed and and playes out is amazing the start of the campaign you walk to a helicopter and then it flys you around telling you what you are doing then you have a little bit between mission where you can walk around and get given mission when you are walking around you can listen to what the other soliders think about what is happing some of there server that are out there are 1 altis life roleplaying 2 domination pve with missions and side missions 3 invade & annex pve with missions and side missions 4 king of the hill tvt 3teams 5 blitzkrieg tvt caputer and hold 5 wasteland survival pvp 6 coop player made mission 7 some ofther fun game modes some of the cool thing to do in arma 3 1 play around in the editor and make missions and use diffrent scripts 2 use diffrent mods like the dayz breakingpoint and f18 3 play the campaign 4 play the little mission made by the comunity 5 fly around the massive map and see what there they are all the good points about the game and there is some bad ones but they are not that bad there is some anoying little bugs and a little bit of a lack of content but somtimes it can matter on what server you are playing the game is new and missions are still getting made so some of them are alittle bit buggy but noting that would really effect yoru gameplay that much
recommended
you dont have the skill or the patience for this game  ing shame
recommended
300 game crashes per second when trying to join every server
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played the amount of simulation aspects in it are incredible and the steam workshop is like a neverending dlc jackpot 1010
recommended
very good only problem is the server lag on mp 55 editor solo etc 155 multiplayer 55 if it had no lag
recommended
the editor is powerful and impressive i made a scenario where we played as blackwater and wasted a bunch of civillians while speeding through the streets 1010 would commit war crimes again
recommended
arma 3 a good improvement more so than the previous ones but the game still suffers from minor faults arma so far is on top of my favorites list
recommended
one of the best games i have played to date altislifecouk with this game is perfect
recommended
if you have ever played any of the arma series this is by far the best one yet has a decently good campaign with a decent storyline and multiplayer is pretty sweet even though most multiplayer servers are custom missions i have yet to find a server that runs stock arma 3 multiplayer but even the custom missions are pretty cool would definitely recommend this game to anyone especially with epoch coming out for it soon so those of you that play dayz epoch dont waste time get this play it enjoy it then enjoy it even more when arma 3 epoch is released
recommended
addictive game good game in the sequencial series and a good representation of the entire genre 810 love it so far reason why its 810 is because i constantly get a bex crash 910 times i try and join the server
recommended
get it
recommended
arma 3 is awsome  lags a bit the best part is playing altis life d
recommended
an absolute great military sim the commmunity mods are wondeful and the games editorcampaign is bugless and very enjoyable overall this games new mechanics and engine make it a must buy for an avid military gamer
recommended
well what can i say massive mp game this is what u are looking for alot of actioncarstankhelis all that u need
recommended
best game i have ever played with my mates ok ok it is buggy and glitchy as hell but to be honest thats arma i would recomend this game to anyone who wants to have a good laugh with some friends if you are alone most of the community is friendly enough to chat to but if you have a social anxiety disorder and dont like other people its good fun to  about in the editor eg place lots of jets and watch them hit each other
recommended
dont buy this game in its current state its worse than playing with a melted gi joe
recommended

very very tactical game and a lot of fun to play with friends 910
recommended
very good game love it it is nice i play it all the time 
recommended
lol i like how theres people who have hundreds of hours in it and leave it a bad review this game is probably one of the best purchases ive made i can always come back to it and have fun the ammount of possibilities in the game is endless and for the most part has a great player base your experience really depends on wherewho you play with arma3 can either be a running simulator or a intense military simulator with moments you wont find in any other game when you do happen to join an awesome server with coordinated people there is much fun to be had buy it dont look back
recommended
i got global banned from both arma 3 and dayz sa because i piked up hacked money in an altis life server complete
recommended
great game epic battles beast graphics and amazing gamemodes on multiplayer
recommended
realy good
recommended
this game has great potential but is killed by engine issues in multiplayer
recommended
this game is tight
recommended
this game is freakin amazing mang this and dayz is the way to go
recommended
kill all your team mates begin a war with in a war
recommended
epic game got a sever for any body
recommended
many graphics much improve wow
recommended
the most epic movie military survival simulation i have ever played wanna create your own action movie simulation where you decide what to do next then this is the game for you i only play on wasteland servers coz i find it more challenging and yes the survival is there which made it more interesting this game is fun playing with friends you need to have a working mic you cant go typing in chat while in a gunfight right  got low frames or performance issues i have one solution for you upgrade your system i just did and it worked like a charm have a nice day
recommended
its is a good and amazing sim and you should all have the chance to play it you will love it
recommended
this is the best shooter simulator on steam
recommended
nice game
recommended
nice game
recommended
this is the best milsim up to date
recommended
arma to others but it is not a game for everyone and even inside the game there will be aspects of the game you like such as [military reinactments] and dislike such as [ battleroyal call of duty deathmatch] so everyone will want to play the game differently but remember its game where no one has to tell you how to play it overall 710 the game has problems in its polish but when you look past it you get a gaming experience like no other note this review has alot of spelling mistakes and missing subjects as i came up with this in 30 mins future reviews will be written on proper writting software and also days in advance i hope this review has helped you note2 743 characters too long sorry i couldnt provide enough info but steam has a character limit so in the immortal words of awsome people i say test review please ignore
recommended
great game worth the money
recommended
not the best shooter but if you like being picked of by snipers this is for you
recommended
arma 2 was better for messing around this is better for everything else 11
recommended
campaign is veru frustrating but multiplayer makes up for it if you have time and spare money pick this game up campaign is 510 multiplayer is 910
recommended
over priced
recommended
i recommend playing dayz first as the community taught me all the tips and tricks about playing arma or an arma based mod when i first picked up arma 3 even after staring at the config screen i was still confused and got stuck repeatedly with dayz it kinda progresses you from how to change from first person to third shooting then figuring out how far your target is away so you can compensate for it arma doesnt really teach you that right away thats way i was lost also the campaign in arma what ive played of it is pretty cool aswell as the multiplayer but its big hitter is definetly the mods battle royal atlas life theyre all great and super fun as well as the community i definetly recommend you get this game as there are endless posibilities
recommended
great fun some good mods
recommended
arma 3 is a great game that you should buy if u like dayz rust any of the arma franchise and other fpswasteland is also great survival addition to this game
recommended
even though i only get 15 fps in a citytown and 30 fps in the countryside on this game i still think it is one of the best games i have played it still has some work to be done to it but thats just what the series is like a bit glitchy some of the good points are 290km map with no limits its a sandbox so you can do whatever the hell you want and a quite good campaign well thats what i think some of the bad points are that it is quite boring for some people it can run pretty well on pcs without having a very good graphics card i have a amd radeon 7730m 2gb graphics card and a i7 core in a laptop and i can run the game this is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite series and i am glad i brought it 910 if you like sortof realistic first person shooters then i would recomend you get this game
recommended
its a nice game
recommended
really great game i recommend many downloadable mods and playable servers for everyone to enjoy
recommended
arma 3 i think incorparates some of the best shooting mechanics ive seen in military sim how ever the mechanics overall can become quite clunky you need a fairly beefy pc to make it look playable it was gifted to me and i actually enjoy but i dont know if id invest to heavily into it its as close you want to get to combat and for that i give it a thumbs up
recommended
>shoots ifrit >rocket goes through ifrit and hits countryside 1010 would play escape altis again
recommended
i only have 4 favorited games in my library this game is one of them
recommended
played arma 3 for a half hour during free beta liked what i saw definitely would buy
recommended
its like arma 2 but playable
recommended
yes many guns much death the struggle is real
recommended
yes many guns much death the struggle is real
recommended
this game is reconmended its fun and it will get better when dev keeps working on for the rest of their lives its a really cool game and i enjoyed it its nuthing like battlefield series or americas army but i wish i didnt paid $60 that really over priced and no poster map book case toys cd video cards keyboard mouse cuz its just electronic download  been 3 12 weeks since i purchased this and i will not spend $60 ever again stuck with 1 game that i could gotten more games with $60 now its on sale so i would have bought the digital deluxe edition for $39 expect this game is covered in bugs server ddos etc hopefully dev fix and add good stuff for the game i expect this game gotta be much much better bigger than any game cuz i spent 60 friggin dollars i was told it will never drop the price down for long time i have been lookin forward for deluxe edition but nope i reconmended get the deluxe edition asap if you like combat or altis life rpg common get it
recommended
if you live simulator games like gta and dayz and stuff of that sort you will love this game i have clocked almost 1000 hours into it and i dont regret it its got endless things to do with mods altis life battle royale breaking point and tons more 1010 buy this game worth any amount of money
recommended
brilliant game
recommended
very nice very good very fun very cool
recommended
best army game ever nothin else to say d
recommended
i love this gameis very real and the graphics are beautiful the game is very good optimized because my video card has 64 mb and i don`t have lag or problemsthank you for this amazing gamei will play it unlimited
recommended
it seems that nobody can get a solid 60fps in this game great game but please optimize it
recommended
fun game its best played with friends though however it does feel very realistic and it takes a bit to get used to if ur used to more close ranged fps
recommended
its ayt just need an enough beefy computer
recommended
never played it i guess its good
recommended
was hiding in a house from the gunfire someone blew up the house with an rpg i survived i laughed i cried the feels bro feels10 must feel again
recommended
this game is amazing with all the moving stuff raiting 1010 no regrets
recommended
i had a life then i downloaded arma 3 havent seen the daylight for 3 months
recommended
graphically this game is amazing
recommended
i want this game
recommended
only get if your crazy about firstperson and thirdperson simulators but bottomline this game has tons of guns and as i say still better than cod
recommended
played wasteland and fell from a tiny ledge which resulted in killing me too hardcore for me
recommended
in the short ammount of time that ive played this i must say that it is quite fun sometimes that map feel too large for the small ammount of people on it but after a bit of wandering i always found something interesting to do
recommended
trust my luck bought this game yesterday for over $80 and today its less than $40 why have you betrayed me gaben  on the plus side the game has been fun so far 1010 would buy for full price again
recommended
its wow
recommended
the pc exclusive title arma 3 is a perfect example of a gaming masterpiece set in the later 2030s in the fictional island nations of altis and stratis arma 3 boasts a map a little smaller than twice the size of washington dc arma 3 also has an extraordinarily large and challenging campaign which i am still struggling to complete also the game is known to be extremely graphically demanding but i can still run it on my macbook pro 13 on low settings on 60fps also arma 3 boasts a variety of wonderful fictional vehicles ranging from civillian vehicles to army transport one of the best traits about arma 3 is the fact that is has so many free mods supported on it the most popular being arma 3 life reallife roleplaying mod the only con for arma 3 is the demanding price as a game that costs $60 is pretty expensive otherwise i highly recommend arma 3 due to its great contribution to pc gaming
recommended
great game keeps me amused for hours however slightly buggy here and there but overall a great game
recommended
this game is the best action game i have ever played it is realistic but no to close range combat like cod its also very intence it gets your heart pumping in my opinion best game ever
recommended
killing people in real life almost seems mundane when you compare it to killing people whilst playing arma 3
recommended
gotta pay the cost to be the boss
recommended
great game would reccomend for anybody just read the requirements or you might be a game you cant run _
recommended
a realistc game with a few bugs but aweson to play in a team of tactical players
recommended
but how do u wite list
recommended
car physics fatigue is pretty dumb good looking  runs
recommended
very good army simualtor favorive in fact
recommended
recommendgame
recommended
very good war simulator game no easy peasy bfcod stuff good graphics good sounds large map alot of game modes and mods the realism on the bullets etc absolutely awesome on invade gamemode as being dropped on 25km away and after that have to silently get on the objective the communication of the team and cas only thing that is bad is the performance on multiplayer some bugs on the doors and inside the buildings and stairs
recommended
good the game
recommended
for just $1599 you can now get the helicopters dlc which includes for that one low price just two helicopters   in addition to this awesome deal you get to shoot from vehicles which should have been in the game in the first place  order now and well double your offer just pay separately for core game mechanics
recommended
my friend got downed and i carried him only to get shot in left nut 1010
recommended
at first i was like      but then      and then a bit after    
recommended
one of the most realstic game i have ever played everything about it works for example graphics are amazing eventually 3rd and 1st person decent shooter nice storyline fun multiplayer somthing however wasnt so great was bit glitch at times not alot missions last forever i would rate it 9 out of 10 and i reccomend getting it
recommended
great game 95% of community is literally cancer
recommended
reviewing games are boring as 
recommended
love this game
recommended
after playing this game for about 20 minutes i decided to leave most every other shooter game behind the scale of this game whats possible and what you can do in it is next to none you can create your own mission or try ones that other people have made in that sense the game is infinite this game has realism tactics stealth weapons vehicles and so much more you can approach any task in a million different ways 2010
recommended
plenty of fun mods and gameplay i would enjoy playing this with anyone
recommended
yersh das is gud
recommended
the paragon of a milsim it is more fluent and less buggy then arma 2 but some issues with it like its  body armor system can way it down
recommended
60 way too buggy for a game to be 60 bugs this is insane
recommended
best game ever  but i cant buy it 
recommended
i only have $02 and i want this
recommended
eli if u are reading this  you and this game is great

best out of breath simulator ever
recommended
possibly the best fps game on the market
recommended
quite good once played yopu get the hang of it but if you like war and have a great pc get it
recommended
the game was great and i really recommend others getting i know i will be getting it
recommended
is a super coll game i played this for the weekend and what can i say i will probably buy this game very very soon 
recommended
one of the best games i have played 1010 it has great graphics gameplay and an all variaty of guns vehicles and has a ton of servers
recommended
it is most best fun fur whole family i love da bugs da loot and dag00t
recommended
this is great for free arma 3 weekend
recommended
the game is very very good the graphics and the fact you cant just rush into battle makes this seem like a great game however wait for a really good sale arma 3 is poorly optimized and you will get loads of lag online multiplayer domination at least coop missions with 24 players are fine is a mess most of the time youll be confused and oneshot by aimbot ai also 10 for helicopters gg overall graphics 1010 optimization 610 gameplay 1110 ai 510 multiplayer for the love of god what is this lag10 community 810 overall  9510 also dem business practices edit dayz and altis life basically ruined the community youll now see 90% of the people crashing the helicopter on the base or just shooting everything in sight gg dayz gg
recommended
i can see how much fun this game can be but when im 1m from the objective and cant get closer to interact with it and cant continue the mission until i interact with it and its only getting in the vehicle well sorry im not gonna spend 30$ in todays market on such a game  i dont care how good people say it is i like the graphics didnt mind the long install time love the mechanics  crawl compass etc i guess im pickier than most however and wary of spending money on a game that starts out rather slow and buggy i know we all wonder why someone cant get it right whith so many trying this game feels closer than most others to achieving that rightness
recommended
very fun a big improvement in the arma series that fatigue system though p
recommended
i liked it during the free weekendso much to the gametoo many controls to cover by the time you see the target you cant react fast enough to kill a target irl time but the enemy can if you are into that i highly recommended the mods make it more fun if 327 button command isnt your thing and you dont feel like being left by yourself on a map that covers like 400 kmhaving to run to your next destination on footthen i do not recommend this
recommended
the game is definitely for the hardcore gamer who wants complete immersion ive been away from fps for awhile and this game proved to be difficult even on novice level till i spent some time practicing also recommended specs should be higher my video card mets recommended specs and i can barely play this on standard video mode
recommended
recommended
recommended
well ive tried out the demo and its not too bad of a game but i think im gonna stick too battlefield 4 until the price drops to about 20 bucks
recommended
a very realistic and exciting war simulator the thing that makes arma so different for all the otehr fpses is that it is so realistic the campain really gives you a realistic feel and the multiplayer has a lot of extrordinairy gamemodes that is fun really reccomend it and that you look into how good it really is because a lot can play this and give up because it is so hard but its really really one of the best fpses there are and the most realistic one i have come over it is so different you cant compare it with cod and battlefield they seem like this ones little brothers when you really get into this one
recommended
please let me play a couple of days longer
recommended
the game is fun i only got a chance to play free weekend till it was over  i wish it was free on steam so i could play again
recommended
really very incredibly good
recommended
found 2 shrek mobiles 1010
recommended
this game is the closest to real combat conditions of any game i have played the graphics are decent and the scenery is very dynamic the game feels better than arma ii with the ease of doing actions though due to the complexity of the game i would recommend a keyboard that can macro every thing this is not battlefield or call of duty this is more of a simulation than a combat based game i think though with it being out for a while now the publisher needs to lower the price as the game ages and stop making dlc like its an ipad freemium game i do like that it is modable something most aaa game developers now forbid
recommended
awsome game with great mechanics
recommended
love it the grapic and with 3 monitors that is epic great game <3
recommended
i have only played it for the weekend but man do i love it despite the minor few glitches its great and man did it make you have to pay attention to your surroundings
recommended
if you love realism this is the game for you if you are a bf or cod fanboy you probably wont like it unless you are like me one who was scratching his head at the absolute sheet fps on the market atm screaming into the windis anything real anymorei hate them so much and by themyou all know which big 2 im talking about all absolute crap garbage i cant believe i paid hard earned bucks and continued in the hopes something finally would come out that would be decent burned thenlike the kool aid manoh yeah arma 3 came crashing through the wall tipping me over in my chair socks blown off my monitor flashed free arma 3 weekend oksurei have nothing to lose i have heard of arma franchiseeven watched some youtube vids on them all at the time nothing really leaped out and said you had to play me but hey its a free weekend so why not now im just down right depressed this game is so amazing i finally found my gem a game thats just so intense the atmosphere graphicsaww god i could go on and on why am i depressedyou ask well all the money i have spent on the other two i couldve put here where it belongs trust me in saying i have lots of titles of the other two and now im having to scrounge for loot so i can buy this i paid for sht when sweetness was staring me in the face awesome game lots and lots of different servers with different mods every game is unique and different so stop reading this and go buy it ps if you dont adjust your play style from the other two fast you will get owned and die a lot this community does not  around you will have to deal with many personalitys and the majority of them keepin it real and hardcore headsets greatly improve your chances of survival
recommended
this game is very fun and continues to supprise me every second i highly recomend it to even to short minded people
recommended
its a must buy love the graphics love all the mods i enjoy modding in this game best game i like thats mod friendly you must buy this game you are missing out on all those cool multiplayer gamemodes like arma 3 life wasteland altis life king of the hill breaking point and epoch mod buy now
recommended
this game is awesome and you must get it nuff said
recommended
great
recommended
the best army game there is
recommended
aessome war sim but i wouldnt play if you have a low end pc like me cause its disconnects you from servers sometimes after saying no message recieved but i would defo reccomend it
recommended
meh its ok not what i expected but still good
recommended
this is an absolust beast of an game recommend it to everyone stunning graphics and many hours of brutal gaming 1010
recommended
i havent gotten a lot of play time in but the time i have had was a lot of fun great game over all from what ive played huge amount of player generated content however horrible controller support if the controller support were to get overhauled this would be the perfect shooter
recommended
game is good remove kebab from desk instead of lug large weight of pack across battlefield reminds me of chechen conflict of 1999 overall good game 1010 ivan approve
recommended
do you want to feel like youre about to die when youre actually not do you want to feel the fear of almost being shot when you escape by just one hair well arma 3 is the game for you one of the most intense and nailbighting games ever when you come so close to living the dream in altis life and you die can be annoying but when you escape near death can be just as amazing as killing someone and picking up their loots arma 3 is one if not the greatest millitary sims ever ps you need a good pc p
recommended
yesyesyes  i need this tried it for the free part and it was awesome tons of things to do and the showcases were cool just watch out because its very cpu intensive and is more singlethreaded sorry amd fx cpus
recommended
im liking the storyline so far first multiplayer i joined i was naked and had no weapons no idea where i was or what to do some guy yelling about a box shot me point blank with a sniper rifle 1010 oh and you run out of breath if you move forward for more than 4 seconds making aiming impossible because thats fun
recommended
great game and a must buy for in the summer sale
recommended
awesome just awesme if you liked arma 2 you will love arma 3
recommended
very versatile mods and a great campaign make this one of the best pc actions games out now
recommended
me and a friend were doing a massive co op mode and we decided to take a quad to the objective later on about 6 km away from the objective the quad breaks so we start walking there we gave up and said screw it and shot eachother  grenaded and my friend was bleeding out so i gave him a medkit then we walked more and the objective changed to about 13 km away and we gave up again so we shot eachother now we are both bleeding out on the ground and stranded in the middle of nowhere until suddenly a friendly tank came moments later and patched us both up then we are inside the tank and i go afk for some juice by the time i got back the tank driver left without giving me nor my friend permission to drive it so my friend brought up that while i was gone a helicopter was here and a guy offered to take us with him my friend said ok but lets wait for my friend to get back being me so when i get back my friend gets in the chopper and said cmon lets get in i was wondering where the pilot is so i got out to find him dead underneath the heli so then me and my friend got out and walked to the nearest air base 2 km away halfway there i realised there was a respawn button so me and my friend used it and spawned at the air base to find dead allys everywhere so we looted them but then the server restarted so we got on gmod 1010
recommended
this is a really good game provides many hours of goodness favorite thing to do is wasteland with freinds
recommended
would be better if i could actually play the game for more than 20 minutes but no
recommended
there isnt mutch to say other than this game is awesome
recommended
war is hell
recommended
a black guy shoots you in altis life and then gets beheaded by a chopper 1010
recommended
buy it for gods sake
recommended
i want this  no  i need this 
recommended
it was feckin amazing i recommend it to everyone but the only downside is you need a good ammount of cpus otherwise you will struggle to get even 10 fps
recommended
seems like a good game only did the training part but seemed good
recommended
i love this game but they should make a free version or make a weekend when u get the game for free for ever cuz 66$ is a lot of money awesome game though played it for two days
recommended
loves how it does things in real life but in a game
recommended
was great but cost to much
recommended
says its running till the 27th my free weekend no longer works on the 26th bit upset about it
recommended
mean as
recommended
worth every penny but theres still alot of improvement to be done like fixing the eject from moving vechile and stuff like that there just quite alot of little stupid bugs like that but would recommend
recommended
ing awesome love playing wasteland
recommended
hooked when i got it on the free weekend deal
recommended
if you like realism and low fps like real life youll like this game
recommended
this is my first dive into military games but so far so good would like a little better controller support otherwise enjoyable game it doesnt have the polish that bf or cod has but the open world aspect is pretty cool
recommended
awesome gameplay awesome maps
recommended
another great game and the one and only realistic military simulation i honestly didnt think they could pull the whole future concept off but they did and its not too futuristic like other gaming companies go overboard with just advanced weapons but still bullets and lead different vehicles and the only downfall is less aircraft but the editor and mods makeup for the lack of aircraft combat
recommended
i approve this message
recommended
beautiful and stunning game i would recommend it for any fan of arma 2 or anyone who likes the military genre
recommended
honestly i dont recommend paying more than $15 for this game no ironsights have to completely stand still to change weapons driving is a joke too much to really name off
recommended
its alpha
recommended
its pretty intense on the right moments if you want intense firefights you should play dominationl but if you like to play strategic you should also play that lol wasteland on the other hand is boring as  lots of vehicles planes and helis you can bomb  and there lots of weapons 8210 best war simulator of the year pc gamer
recommended
this is a funny game but its small bugs in it  but i recommend this game if you like war simulation games
recommended
one of the best game ever <3 
recommended
its is a good and amazing sim and you should all have the chance to play it you will love it
recommended
one of the most beautiful games ive ever played and one of the most challenging arma iii is an essential game for any wouldbe fps player as it exclusively immerses the player and requires co ordination and immense teamwork i recommend it simply because it is a beautiful game
recommended
i love this game and if you want the intenceness of a real battle but dont want to die  heres your solution
recommended
buy it right now oh lawdy
recommended
the previous title arma 2 in my opinion is in ways better than the third installment
recommended
buy it use it fix it mod it upgrade itoh yeah buy this  9510
recommended
1010 game would play again and again what i do  bwg altis life <3
recommended
what is this  after update all kinds of errors game james did you fix sniper mag going from 8 aclip to 1 a clip i guess not you broke the game id say wait 1 but i yell you now you twits
recommended
would be better if i could actually play the game for more than 20 minutes but no
recommended
this game is for the hard core milsim it has a large learning curve this game should only be played with a clan it is a very awsome game but due to its complexity you will need a clan to help you out they will set what mods will be used in the game and teach you what you need to know i do recommened the 48th mechanized infantry i ran with them for a long time before i had to quit and get back to school
recommended
amazingand so beautiful
recommended
amazing game could be better optimized tho
recommended
its a military sandbox game set in 2030 its a very good game worth the money if its on sale its a  oblivion that youd buy this
recommended
awesome game and a great step forward how ever all the nato guns suck dowload a us weapons mod and it makes everthing better
recommended
very good game by far the best military simulator game that there is is much more fun than arma2
recommended
update march 2014  this game has become one of my most fav fpstps games for us$20 cjs or us$35 to us$40 this game is so enjoyable with clanmates via coop  it has free dedicated servers server browser  ping displayed music can turn off  graphics are so better then bf4 and cod ghost tones of free maps and mods i now play this on a haswell with great frame rate also has multiple free dlcs worth the investment dont get cod ghost buy this instead recent game play footage i recorded  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdsofogogacw arma 3 looks like it could be a really good game of 2013 to replace grfs and bf3 my guess is once they optmise it for duel and single core cpus  fix multiplayer fix textures and release standalone dedicated servers without needing steam for linux and windos people are going to play this in droves flying is an art so dont assume you can jump in and fly straight away my duel core 2ghz socket 775560ti8gig ram system gets 19fps out of this game which was the same fps i got from gr online open beta and crysis 3 mp open beta warning lite free gift copy is single player only big let down on that
recommended
1010 would get stuck in a rock again in all seriousness this game really puts it all on the table realistic bullet drop realistic combat and ai youll die a lot expansive maps team effort and a fun time anyone looking for a replacement for combat sims or shooters need not look further just watch out for rocks 
recommended
this is the best sandbox shooter i played in my life you definitely have to try this one with a mod like wasteland
recommended
this is the best game ever made for pc it servers as a base for the 52 mods i use
recommended
its a good game just needs bette optimzation and some key bugs need to be fixed
recommended
way better than battlefield 3 and arma 2 it plays smooth it feels right just ing awesome
recommended
requires beastly computer to play on good fps but can get very addicting if you play on the right servers
recommended
perfect game for tactical and military strategic gamplay not for fun like running around and trolling if you want to do that go fk yourself and go get a life
recommended
this is the best game ive evere had and recommend if you like millitary games the only thing with im disappointed is that the campain has some really annoying bugsbut is ok
recommended
recommend to anyone who likes any sort of combat game has great balance of first person combat and vehicle sea land and air combat the weapons dont customise very much but that doesnt matter so much as there is a very wide range of weapons and attachments very well optimised and runs smoothly on all occasions the only problem is if you are playing online with a computer running at low settings as you cannot see enemys as clear or as far away as those with higher grade computers can and sometimes becomes annoying but the game is worth the purchase just for the campain
recommended
it has dumb cops 2110 ign
recommended
i can write a review but i dont own it loominati comfuurmed duuhhhh seems like a good game ill recommend it cool cool
recommended
its very fun game buy it now 
recommended

recommended
best military simulation on the market definitely worth your money
recommended
most realistic actionshooterstrategy game of all times
recommended
this is the perfect military game and if you are into tactics and positions in a fight this is he game for you with several thousand hours of multiplayer gameplay and dlc there is so much to do
recommended

arma series has always had faithful fanbase and for a good reason while not the most optimized or most fluid gameplay wise theyve brought a oneofakind twist to whole fps genre with realism and simulation arma 3 continues this trend and does so very well this game offers insane value in terms of varied gamemodes there is an endless ocean of great and not so great mods for arma which alter the gameplay in many different ways mods are the reason why you should buy this game you quite literally get dozens of games worth of content by buying arma 3 you can play survival role play play massive war scenarios just shoot for fun its all there visually this is one of the most impressive looking games to date huge maps with absolutely massive draw distance fair amount of texture detail and good lighting effects really add up to a spectacular feel night time is especially impressive with really dark nights and tracer shots lighting up the sky all this comes with a hefty price though this game really brings even most poverful computers down to their knees optimization isnt great this time around either and multiplayer performance suffers quite a blow please do your research before buying so you at least have some clue if thisll run at all sound assets are good guns sound beefy and other little details such as bullet impacts really bring immersion and feel of danger to gunfights built in voip communication is absolutely necessary and its done well with vod and everything voice chat does get bit crackly sometimes though gameplay has always been both the high and low point of arma series and this doesnt change luckily enough some features are bit better this time and i especially like the new inventory layout controls are still somewhat clunky and mousewheel has way more functions bound to it than ever necessary also arma doors are legendary for being annyoying buildings have some clipping issues which combined with awkward doors and bit jerky movement can lead to sticky situations vehicle controls are for the most part fine but cars blow up if you look at them funny gunplay is a thing ive always loved in arma realistic effective distances for guns and decent bullet physics make shooting and hitting really satisfying assault rifles can still be very very deadly up to 500m or so and draw distance allows for extremely long range sniping sniping is real hard though dont expect point and click combine this with good gun sounds and visuals and weve got one impressive package close combat is sometimes bit iffy in multiplayer as lag and desyncing can make hit detection not work perfectly and its common situation for 2 players to end up killing each other in cqb this is a war simulation game though so if you come expecting some fast paced shooting action for a 30 minute session every now and then you should probably look elsewhere arma 3 takes dedication and even if there are some gamemodes designed for casual action theyre still slow paced compared to other shooters people camp for hours just to snipe you in perfect oppourtunity people try to avoid fair engagements you will die to players you never thought were anywhere near you you will be brought down by massive hail of bullets from attack helicopter mile high in the sky if youre fine with the things in last paragraph and have a good pc get arma 3 you wont regret it

i dont know what to say about this game but heres a pancake recipe ingredients 100g plain flour 2 eggs 300ml semiskimmed milk 1 tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable plus extra for frying pinch salt method 1 blending in the flour put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre crack the eggs into the middle then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil start whisking from the centre gradually drawing the flour into the eggs milk and oil once all the flour is incorporated beat until you have a smooth thick paste add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat 2 finishing the batter add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter while still whisking pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream traditionally people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins to allow the starch in the flour to swell but theres no need 3 getting the right thickness heat the pan over a moderate heat then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper ladle some batter into the pan tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer quickly pour any excess batter into a jug return the pan to the heat then leave to cook undisturbed for about 30 secs pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl if the pan is the right temperature the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn 4 flipping pancakes hold the pan handle ease a fish slice under the pancake then quickly lift and flip it over make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate continue with the rest of the batter serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate you can freeze the pancakes for 1 month wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead

uh not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for pancakes instead ingredients 1 12 cups allpurpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 14 teaspoon salt 18 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 14 cups milk at room temperature 12 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter plus more as needed now to make it 1 in a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg 2 in another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla 3 melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat 4 whisk the butter into the milk mixture add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5 keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 14 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed 6 procedure for adding fruit to pancakes once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings

i love this game but its hard to review since the mods change the gameplay a lot so i made a list of reviews for the mods that ive played ill update the list once i play more mods and i expect to play this game a good amount so expect many updates if you want to recommend a mod i recommend you recommend it in the comments battle royale this was the first mod i played and it was what convenced me to buy the game i really enjoyed looting and having to slowly move closer to your enemys made the gameplay super intresting and i think really shows arma 3 capabilities 910 battle royale ghost hotel aka call of duty easy to win nuf said 310 breaking point one of the first mods i played was breaking point after a while i got a working plane but on my way to the plane i got shot at i thought it was all good untill i passed out while flying i crashed straight into some people tbaging a dead body 710 also whats up with me only playing mods that start with b lolz

in a trial of arma 3 i managed to buy and sell drugs and play passenger with a buddy i also went alone and found food all over the land and got free badass weapons a great game for dayz and arma fans
recommended
$1600 us for 2 bad helicopters or to even be able to sit in the back seat of one no content no shotguns buggy like every other arma game realistic militarywar simulation helicopters and planes explode when they touch water impossible to try and survive a crash landing even if you are hovering and descending 2 mph most  admins on any server its fun i guess
recommended
alpha is  the terrain detai is seriously lacking shadow and lightening effects seem not to be working properly and the most important thing is the performance is horrible with 660ti i am only getting 35 fps putting on medium quality definitely looking forward to beta and full game but alpha is just 
recommended
a really awesome game if u got the money to get it get then its only $60
recommended
i was having a fun time on this game its a next generation military game for sure with its amazing graphics heart racing battles and realisim i am going to say 1010 but for fans of arma who have been playing for a long time like me they will notice major changes that will make them feel like noobs all over again and it just does not have that feel arma always had nore does it really have the same setting but still it is a great game also if you intend to play offline or with a buddy against the ai i seriously recommend getting the ffis firefight improvement system mod it will make the ai much smarter but also more realistic and make there precision with guns less accurate originally the ai will lay down or crouch and sit in the same position for the whole battle while firing with inrealistic accuracy and sometimes even instantly snap there aim to you regardless of where you are the campaign has improved majorly since the last time i reviewed arma 3 enemys seem to be placed better and move toward you better some items that make the game easier or harder have also been removed some ai are as stupid as hell though also if you find the current factions to be a bit bland or lacking a lot of content then take a look at the rhs escalation mod it add some new factions with countless vehicals and weapons and customization options to the game i also recommend downloading addons from the steam workshop these include gamemodes missions some weapons new units and much more to improve arma 3 or repair something wrong that is what i have to say for now to divide the review up in numbers content on purchase 710 dlc content 510 free down loadable content mods 810 community 610 true to genre 910 overhall 1010

amazing game has many things to do and have never been bored playing full of cheap dlcs you can easly spend 50 hours on this game for what it costs its worth it

recommended
dayz breaking point mod amd koth is bae with a group of 25 competent friends who can get over the steep learning curve and unforgiving deaths but with all that nonsense you get loot and you can kill people and establish houses and territories very sandbox milsim game 97510 add more to breaking poing mod

recommended
an in depth game about what else military combat and war i love arma 2 but this one expands on that and then some 910
recommended
recommending this game is a nobrainer if you are even into shooters with a nag for realism arma 3 is inevitable the game wont let you in easily it has a steep learning curve and starting out can be quite frustrating also you are less likely to find good public servers it hardly is hopon and play like cod or battlefield the best way to experience it is in a clan or community group groups range from runandgun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff so there should be something for everybody
recommended
amazing how this game works best game yet
recommended
i love this game its got the realism heart pounding action and community that i love however it does have its faults its main one is its multiplayer fps in single player i get between 80 and 60 fps depending on how heavy the action is but the moment i join a multiplayer server even one i host myself on a blank map it struggles to stay over 20 with the same settings in the same areas i have a pretty beefy rig as well so unless you have a true monster be warned my specs cpu intel i74770k @ 350ghz ram 32 gb gpu nvidia titan z os windows 7 ultimate 64bit
recommended
this is a fantastic fpstps shooter for those of you who play cod & battlefield this is hardcore fps here beautiful graphics fantastic freedom but whats the catch well you need a mega pc to run this  game anything beyond a gtx 690 should run it well on not sure on amd though plz cod 9 yr olds do not ruin this game with your stupid raging kthxbai
recommended
tis good
recommended
hello im gona review arma 3 its a military first person shooter this game has a pretty high learning curve with stances weapons modifications and other things as i said this game is not your typtical shooter where u storm buildings and shoot fast firing gunsin this game u need strategy to complete missions the guns in the game can kill people really fast so u need to be creative and not run and gunning there is coopsingleplayermultiplayereven a real life altis life gamemode i would greatly recommend this game but be careful if u havnt played a game before or havnt played a arma at all its gona be hard to learn this so u must spend some hours just to get used to the mechanics
recommended
if you need a tactical teamwork filled adrenaline rush then arma is the place to be you need to spend a long time learning the recoil patterns and even the wind speed changes how your bullets fly through the air this game is not for the call of duty or battlefield player who just likes to run and gun there are lots of places to explore in the map because its so big but in a gamemode like domination or king of the hill youll be deployed to one area only so it will be a close engagement in that place only lots of workshop content to keep you busy after that campaign is over but the muiltiplayer is where its at 910  only for the hardcore military player who loves teamwork and long engagements
recommended
this is a really fun game with infinite possibilities but it is buggy as hell sometimes when i enter a vehicle i die instantly
recommended
this is definatley the best sandbox game out there it has a great and creative community which have created amazing variants such as wasteland or king of the hill it is always action packed online and it runs smoothly on most pcs there is so much to learn and do which is why i find it so addictive and would recommend it to anyone i know
recommended
amazing graphics
recommended
really good game and very enojyable
recommended
fantastic game with a lot of mods the best military simulator i have played you should get it if you have the money the arma 3 life mod actually reminds me of gta v but a lot of more role play in it i recommend this game 1010
recommended
easily the most complete featurerich and versatile milsim on the market just go look at the makearmanotwar contest that recently highlighted a bunch of that sweet communitymade goodness
recommended
very nice game got a bunch of options for game mods
recommended
very good wish i had it played it for free and it is amazing
recommended
worth the buy
recommended
there is a lot to say about this game i dont even know where to start arma 3 is an excellent open world military sandbox with a focus on realistic elements and endless possibilities the infantry play is simply superb the combat feels extremely fresh and different from other games the part i love the most about it is that it gets the very basics right rounds are fired from the muzzle of the weapon model itself rather than from the center of the screen unlike just about any other fps there is the ability to move your head around and you can see your own body and legs in first person the maps are huge and detailed without mentioning the plethora of usermade maps you can also download maps from the previous games there is a map editor that lets you do anything and i really mean it anything that you have in mind which translates to endless fun want to make an urban infantry firefight in the middle of a city you can want to make an air battle with jets and helicopters and take part in it or simply watch it from the ground in the middle of the night you can want to make a tank battle a combined arms war a scripted campaignlike mission want to just spawn 300 goats at once all up to you coop with friends is simply one of the most thrilling and fun activities you can experience in pc gaming pvp combined arms battles with 90 players can be downright insane although it can be laggy as hell this game never feels old given the regular huge updates which add core game mechanics to the game without mentioning the gigabytes of various fixes and improvements the developers are very active from discussing with customers to implementing feature requests even very big ones such as weapon resting and bipod deployement firing from vehicles sound overhauling etc and to top it all off bees cast shadows
recommended
this game is awesome i once hit a tank with a hunter blew him up and no damage to my hunter physxs are also amazing i mean like just hit a bump in a atv and does 3 backflips and also ign rated 6910

my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game ever were on our way to the objective a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces im leading a team of 4 men we come to a crossroad and i sprint across telling my men to hold back i cross a few more times trying to get a response from any snipers nothing i run my lmg gunner runs my medic runs but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through remember the sniper scene the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down he then takes two more in the chest the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills he played it up to 11 here he screams as hes being shot crawling drenched in his own blood sarge you aint leaving me out here like this right ii wanna go with you guys cmon sarge hhelp me cmon please dont leave me he died after that i cried and he respawned 1110 would recommend getting

this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things having done both military service and picked up milsim airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality there are experiences you will have in arma 3 that can not be had in cod or bf experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release one that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower i was squad leader of 8 or so ais as we approached the comms tower and i told my men to go stealth no firing unless fired upon we moved slowly taking advantage of terrain keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and i spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower there i positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as i had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower i considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position but a firefight is always a risk and these ai had been around for a few missions and i had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly i might get hit and killed as i considered how i would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern i realised the tower is unguarded and i had an opportunity to do something i had not considered i got up and ran as fast as i could towards the tower all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head i kept scanning as i ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols after what seemed like far too long i reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention i turned around and made my way back as i closed on my men i started ordering them to fall back hope growing that i might get out of this alive falling back to about 400 meters i finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to command i had done it i had pulled off the perfect mission not a shot fired and all under my command back alive that is what this game is about

oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter as it is so so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning the gameplay is excellent the mechanics are solid and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series as i was may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fpsshooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief brutal and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no minimaps no enemy ui iconsindicators no hit markers no health bars if you get shot a couple of times you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness cover teamwork suppressive fire and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles armor helicopters and planes each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts each containing 1215 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding and challenging i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete however the singleplayer campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer oh god the multiplayer wasteland king of the hill invade and annex battle royale breaking point so many coop opportunities the amazing looking upcoming epoch currently in closed alpha im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later if you do not find my review helpful please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback

this is quite possibly the most emotional shooter ive ever played and its not because of the campaign crowd around children its story time one day not so long ago my squad had just destroyed an antiair battery our pilot landed and the rest of the squad boarded one by one i was about to get in when the rockets started flying the chopper lifted off with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes unwilling to die before then i rushed to the nearest cover a small house by a narrow road i entered to find a ten yearold player who had also been left behind he explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his clan i politely declined explaining that my own squad was inbound as i finished a ghost hawk flew over the horizon my squad had arrived this noble child soldier and i were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting the sniper screamed as a 65 mm cartridge entered his leg his shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as i climbed in the transport my new friend was dead 1010 would experience survivor guilt again

if you have friends this is a great game to play with them if you dont have any friends this is a great game to play alone if you dont have the game to play get the money for it if you dont have the money for it get a job if you dont have a job rob the bank if you get arrested robbing the bank at least you tried

after some 1400 hours on the game i can say with full validity this game has ruined my life if you like realistic physics teamwork and every form of warfare this game is for you 1010
recommended
cant tell you if you should buy it or not but i can tell you this you will find annoying bugs highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have but when you really get down to it and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission its something magical you just cant find in any other game arma is not a game which you pick up at launch play the campaign and a bit of mp and then trow away you buy it love it or hate it and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly arma is a game which you can never called finished there will always be added to it be it user or official content fixes features or optimizations hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it  if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare this will be your gem ill give it a 910 simply because screw bugs ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back read i will not accept random friend requests if you have a question please post it in the comments
recommended
its not a good game for newbies no its not i use to sit at a place and watch the sunset i have no idea how to actually shoot drive and complete missions its like my personal sunset simulator and its damn beautiful 1010
recommended
i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 1020 minutes in a single location sometimes longer i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible unless doing paintballing or airgunning and if you do buy the game  i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game
recommended
i like this game very much

it was fun willl it llasted

810 excellent game great tactical shooter with first person and third person perspective lots of game modes and even more coming out all the time so many to name and not enough words for them all great campaign very challenging with many challenge modes to also play play with friends or by yourself in land sea and air combat weaponry ranging from pistols to rocket launchers atvs to tanks hummingbirds to jets
recommended
400 hours played game has really high learning curve but after player gets hang of it there is alot to enjoy tons of mods for more hardcore players and others for more casual players best played with group of friends but alot of social players who want to team work out there too
recommended
this is a very good game
recommended
this is a great game no matter what you like a game to mess around in running around as chickens or a tactical shooter where teamwork is the key it is pretty well rounded any role if it be a fighter pilot or an infantry soldier is available for use

this game isnt that bad it lacks quantity of weapons and vehicles though i would have to say in the long run arma 2 and arma 2 oa are better in terms of quality and quantity

if you like  controls and lack of immersion this game is for you

my 1st real experience with arma 3 so i join this random server everyone at base grandpa commander was yapping on to everyone telling us all to get to our squads and so on didnt really pay much attention some random bodies on the floor tbagged em while looking at fellow team mate suddenly see a group of guys in scuba outfits thought they looked call the goto grandpa commander asking for heli he calls one over they say i need to join their squad to go with them whatever that meant 3 more guys followed me and the scuba guys into the heli not knowing what we were getting into inside the heli i joined their squad after a white we get dropped off on a cliff near the ocean and team leader says to follow him we walk like 1k till we see the radio tower our objective looked like no one was there looked easy team leader assigned us all a buddy so wed work as small teams we move on closer to it come upon a small hut 300m out of the radio tower and team leader says hes going down with a couple of us while the rest of us stay up to support him he moves down and they plant the c4 on the tower team leader says its gonna blow stay clear and it slowly falls down we suddenly start to spot enemies moving on the hill over the tower veichales with big guns small infantry teams moving quickly apon them so they get behind a small area covered by bamboo me and the others including a sniper start taking out enemies on the hill teamleader called us all to move in except the sniper we quickly move in and join upto them we hold off behind the bamboo for a while and a veichale starts moving in we all panic and fall back a bit but he eventually goes away teamleader orders us to move up into the small house there was near the tower so we do we get a small resistance force as we moved in didnt take long to take them all out we hold position for a while and teamleader says we were suddenly the only attack force in the ao everyone else was at base listening to grandpa commander we fight off a few more small forces until it began to get dark all of a sudden it went quiet all we could hear were crickets then out of no where contact from the west contact on the north we were scattered out around the house some of us including me take hits medic came and quickly patched us up so we could continue to fight fighting became impossible some were low on ammo without night vision you couldnt see a thing and most of us didnt come with nightvision scopes on our guns quickly a bigger force moved onto us veichales battered at us from all sides grandpa comander says the main assault force had moved in all souteast of our location our medic ran out of medkits we struggled to keep off the enemy and then our sniper left cut down to a 6 man team we struggled to keep the enemy away the main force had battled to the center of the ao when then our team leader gets hit medic cant revive him we struggled to fight off the enemy no more infantry were around but an enemy veichale had us cornered near the house i realise my buddy wasnt here and we called for him no answer i told my superior i was going to check on him as i move up to his position i realise he was out shot by an enemy i call it and carry his body back we try reviving them but no luck so my superior says we were going to move up to catch up with the other squad as we began they say the ao was captured and mission was ended the superior said for us to move up to heli and leave the bodies behind we sprit toward the propellars we hear of a near by heli as we approach it it suddenly begins to take off the superior shouts wait for us wait for us it waited as we all got on another squad was already on it we waited for another one of ours to cath up and he then says the heli was full and couldnt come back for us as we all looked at him he took his own life the heli began to take off we didnt say a word the journey back that is arma 3

amazing war simulator beautiful with mods and allinall a brilliant game many o hours really show peoples effort they put into the game and every minute even in the load up is worth it a must buy addon the games a heavy load really cpu heavy if you have a good graphics card and a bad cpu which yes i have run the game on maxed settings  the fps boosts a heck of a ton it transfers the load onto the card happy hunting
recommended
this game is awesome for its multiplayer and campaign and dont forget the editor part oh gawd how many hours i have spent on editor so yeah i recommend this game if you like action and tactical combat the dlcs on this game is great my personal favorite dlc is the heli dlc cause i love to fly helicopters in that game it has also a gokart dlc and thats very fun with friends to race with so yeah i rate 1010
recommended
only played this a couple of hours id say its all right yeah probably recommend it
recommended
this is a great game and i think that you should play this game this game has fun multiplayer and has mods like battle royel and atlis life
recommended
i love the realism and the many game modes and there are so many awesome workshop scenarios

if only this was set in an uncivilised country like canada or sesame street and i could slay the queers and hang them from the back of my pickup and drive down a road in pakistan
recommended
in my opinion its not optimized for the pc but if you have a beast pc and you like realistic war games get it
recommended
its the best way better than arma 2 way better than i expected it i highly recomend this to those who play arma 2 or those who like combat games with huge free roam maps and tons of addons 1110
recommended
if someone asks me what is the best game i have ever played then without contemplation i will definitely choose arma3 it has the best graphic ive ever seen it satisfies the ultrarealism ive been looking for i thought bf series were realistic and last but not least it makes gamers to jump into gamemaking i doubt games better than this would come out any time because i strongly insist this is the most breath taking and innovative game ive ever seen
recommended
710  an evolution from previous installments nice graphics and solid simulation great squad placed multiplayer over a massive 400km sandbox lack of content hurts its score although more is being released and developed more campaign missions coming this december pros nice graphics solid shooter simulation mechanics more accessable compared to other titles but looses none of its depth great combined arms mp cons lack of content only a partial campaign no training missions and still plenty of bugs remains
recommended
very smexy 
recommended
awesome game from and awesome company this game has given me hours of fun and with the dlc and free platform updates its juts keeps getting better and better highly recommend but you would need a good pc to run
recommended
beatifull game had a lot of fun banging people
recommended
amazing game so much to do and hours of fun it is worth paying full price 1010
recommended
the best game of the 2010s i have to admit it is even better than skyrim the level of simulation and reality in this game coupled with the combination of fun and play is amazing i never thought that a simulation could be this realistic and fun at the same time must buy 1710 absolutley amazing you are an idiot if you dont buy this
recommended
another great addition to the arma series
recommended
most realistic first person shoother i have ever played
recommended
i suggest waiting for it to come on sale then it is definitely worth it i will forwarn you the game does not really seem complete at purchase however the modding community is amazing and their mods have not ceased in amazing me i would strongly suggest the mods that add the old arma 2 units and maps marsoc and spetznaz maybe on armaholic for units it is really great to go back and see these remastered maps then playing on them with the updated engine whew boy thats some good stuff id say that finding people to play with is really important too i dont do the altis life games but i have friends that do and they enjoy it finding squads that are nice enough to allow pubbies on are generally the way to go if you will be playing milsim then for the love of all that is good get task force arrowhead radio it will enhance the gameplay experience tenfold the only real con to it is that sometimes good games are few and far between but the time you spend to find one is well worth the reward when you get to play make sure to star it in your server list i am not a part of a squad but if you really want to boost your gameplay then i would strongly suggest it overall im not impressed by bis work but moreso the modders and to all the modders out there thank you d if you wanna game thats run and gun this isnt for you if you wanna game that will challenge you and put your skills to the test this is it i will honestly say one thing that pisses me off more than anything is the ais accuracy but it is possible to change nothing like getting capped in the head by and ai with a pistol 45 yards away i would definitely recommend it to people who are tired of cod or bf or are like me and never really liked those other two in the first place because i jumped into arma p enjoy it and have some good times you may even make a friend along the way
recommended
cant even explain how good this game is love realistic shooters theres no doubt you will like this and if you dont youre insane

recommended
great game i just dont like the fact that bans carry over from game to game
recommended
great game bohemia interactive does great work
recommended
its a really good strategized tactical 1st3rd person shooter and i enjoyed playing it but i could only play on really close local servers because it takes a really good custom gaming pc to run if you dont have good specs i think youd only be able to play single player
recommended
i want the game i will be getting it soon this will be a cool game soon once i get it
recommended
pretty good game was really surprised to find out my computer could run it guns feel a bit flimsy at point run for five seconds with lmg aim sway makes you shoot around guy five feet in front of you but theres a satisfying feeling when you win a gunfight also worst design choice ever  if you played arma 2 know that the inventory button in arma 3 is i not g g by default throws a grenade just saying

recommended
2014 best military simulator available for the general public make sure you try out the mod king of the hill koth
recommended
arma 3 if you love modern warfighting to a new level and loved arma 2 then most likely you own this if you dont then what are you waiting for if you have not played any of the arma series pick this one up you are in for a real treat
recommended
really awesome game runs like poop on my fx8350290x rig though it really likes intel processors being a singlethreaded cpu heavy game
recommended
why cant i run this ever time i click on the arma 3 short cut it brings me here
recommended
awesome experience
recommended
arma 3 and the rest of the arma series is best enjoyed with either a good organized and not so serious group or friends since this game lives by its user created content there is an editor included that lets you create you own missions let those be small or large easy or tough you are the creator not to forget the steadily growing amount of user created mods this game is a simulator sometimes for walking long distances so do not expect any arcadey gameplay you get shot you may live and treat your wounds or you may die instantly tactical thinking is the key here and running head on is mostly the wrong thing to do
recommended
good game i recommend king of the hill game mode
recommended
so you kill ragheads and then you install mods 911 would buy again
recommended
everything simulator 2013

recommended
might be my favorite game
recommended
this game is so cool
recommended
i bought this game for $60 and the next day there was a 50% off sale not even mad about it 1110
recommended
wow  great game i really wish i had tried it out sooner although it is not on sale often get it on sale edit  ok so ive played like 20 hrs i have to say if this was released in 2013 and its on the verge of 2015 and the game is sooo fn buggy and unoptimized  it really makes me wonder that in a nutshell is the exact reason i held off on buying arma 2 or 3 until almost 2 yrs after initial release and its still pretty crazy that i have to manually optimize memory and stuff to get even 12 decent fps and while reading all forums and stuff  why in the hell do i see some gokart racing dlc what the hell are they doing over there that they add a gokart dlc over actually fixing the game i really enjoy the gameplay when it runs smooth but wow what an unoptimized setup and i have a pretty high end pc i truly feel like i just bought an early access release and by the way  do they have a proper english proofreader i mean i see typos missing letters and obvious grammar slipups that are easily noticeable that alone should be a giant red flag well i hope this gets resolved but not likely since its been 2yrs since release good luck bohemia  if you keep releasing unfinished games someone will inevitably replace you with a better more optimized game just look at all those hungry game studios and devs  its going to happen if bi keeps putting out shoddy products thats the way these things work
recommended
is good for shooting people with your gun
recommended
bohemia did somthing right love you bohemia but dayz fix it
recommended
this gameits a large map sandbox designed gameit takes a beastly pc to run it however it will freeze alot over the time that you get itthe trick to learning how to be good at it is teamworkstrategytactics and common senseyou dont need to be the best sniper in the game to have fun and be good at itevery person counts in combined operations since every person is a partit has a good modding community and in general a great game
recommended
why can i write a review dont even have the game lol
recommended
i play this game alot good gaem yes fun
recommended
the game is just amazing if you like arma 2 you will definitely like arma 3 if you never played that game get it now you will enjoy it for sure the simulation is good but not perfect since sometimes he have obstacle that normally in real life you will be enable to dobut you cant in arma 3but yeah 1 thing is annoying is the crash sometimes you can get in arma 3 let me explain my experience when i started for the first time the game first i open my game i go in multiplayerand i join a server all my keys where messed up so i had to keybind everything after 15mins i was almost done but i get hit by a car and die and my game crash so yeah 1010 would get bump and crash again
recommended
i like the game i played it on the free weekend but i couldnt buy it soon enough while it was on sale so now i have to wait even longer to buy it i just really wish they would lower the price because its been 60 bucks since the day it came out
recommended

recommended
arma 3 is for real cadets
recommended
its a good game yeah 1010
recommended
great game good graphics if u like shooters get this
recommended
love it 
recommended
great game with a lot of potential to be something more than it is unfortunately the game engine sucks after more than 2000 hours on arma 2 and 3 its still the number one complaint maybe theyll get right one day if you like mil sims get this this isnt like cod you wont be doing any 360 no scopes you may be running to get into position for over and hour to get to your objective and for that one chance of a shot tactics is a must there is no god mode do anything stupid and you will be punished severely 710 would be 1010 if they had a better engine
recommended
very good if you have the comr to run it
recommended
you can race gokarts 1010
recommended
dis be aight
recommended
basically ruined a year old my life rdm in altis life dupe in wasteland to get tanks cheat in battle royale to win justarmathings
recommended
so much fun a great change of pace from any other fps
recommended
arma 3 has a ton of potential to becoming the all known war game well all love and play it however suffers from major faults which are holding its absolute success back it suffers from relatively poor performance art and design inconsistencies some odd game mechanics and relatively weak visuals bohemia interactive has a lot to work on and no its not going to be another vehicle dlc pack that ill be looking for
recommended
well good recommended
recommended
its awesome
recommended
100 hours of fun worth to buy
recommended
awesome highly suggest this game endless possibilitys
recommended
i bought this game for myself and a friend while it was on sale for christmasblackfriday and now im  that after that sale it went on sale again for even cheaper wtf steam
recommended
worth it just for battle royale
recommended
realistic hardcore battle simulator not for the easily bored a
recommended
arma 3 is definitely one of the best shooters out there such a step up from arma 2 it still has bugs and content is still being rolled out but its a beautiful looking game and plays smoothly negative reviews being posted about the game running like  are just peoples poor computers definitely recommended 9510
recommended
i hope you enjoy having a decent pc and get under 20 fps on some servers
recommended
one of the best games i ever bought on steam
recommended
best game in the world and i dont own it [
recommended
children play call of duty boys play battlefield men play arma

recommended
yes its good but for some reson my pc does not want to run t over 10 fps no clue
recommended
game of the year 20132014 imo
recommended
i have not bought this game yet but i played it in the free weekend i loved it i love how realistic it sounds sure the no bipods are a little bit annoying but the game is continually tweaked and small things will be added in due time i am a big fan of sound effects and arma 3 delivers them on a silver  platter with the best poutine in the world the purchasing factor on this game was sound effects after about 5 minutes i found my way into an artillery then i fired it oh my god i felt the rumble in my feet subwoofer on my desk and the bang in my ears arma 3 is the best game if you want the best sound effects in a shooter battlefield call of duty and world of tanks dont even come close to this level of sound effect quality arma 3 is in a class of its own and when i say that i mean that there is not even a teacher because all the other games have to take from arma 3 in order to be in that class for me this is hands down the game of the decade this game is awesome in sound graphics mechanics and realism i would buy the  out of it
recommended
i recommend this game it is already in beta d
recommended
this game omg this game
recommended
if your stuck with csc and battle field then your missing out on great millitary games go right across you deadly cross hairs because arma is a more realistic simulater of battle so if you here a single pop or crackle you may experince the real army feeling of fear arma 3 contans great single player and multiplayer action with multible modes to choose from my personal favoret altis life which is and rpg mode arma 3 also has realistic shooting as in not so easy to hit someone with out being careful i suggest arma 3 to any 1
recommended
arma 3 if you love modern warfighting to a new level and loved arma 2 then most likely you own this if you dont then what are you waiting for if you have not played any of the arma series pick this one up you are in for a real treat

can someone please buy arma 3 as a gift to me please  you see i am very poor and i just cant afford a game like arma 3 i just love this intense game and it has a wonderful sensation i wish i could just get my hands on it but i dont have the required amount of mey just yet im just begging anyone out there that is kind to buy me this game as a gift it would touch my heart deep inside me  im crying now as i type if anyone out there has a heart that is strong enough to be generous i would highly appreciate it  most people wont listen but it will be awesome thankyou 
recommended
i dont know what to say about this game but heres a pancake recipe ingredients 100g plain flour 2 eggs 300ml semiskimmed milk 1 tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable plus extra for frying pinch salt method 1 blending in the flour put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre crack the eggs into the middle then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil start whisking from the centre gradually drawing the flour into the eggs milk and oil once all the flour is incorporated beat until you have a smooth thick paste add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat 2 finishing the batter add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter while still whisking pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream traditionally people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins to allow the starch in the flour to swell but theres no need 3 getting the right thickness heat the pan over a moderate heat then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper ladle some batter into the pan tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer quickly pour any excess batter into a jug return the pan to the heat then leave to cook undisturbed for about 30 secs pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl if the pan is the right temperature the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn 4 flipping pancakes hold the pan handle ease a fish slice under the pancake then quickly lift and flip it over make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate continue with the rest of the batter serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate you can freeze the pancakes for 1 month wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead
recommended
this game is awesome for its multiplayer and campaign and dont forget the editor part oh gawd how many hours i have spent on editor so yeah i recommend this game if you like action and tactical combat the dlcs on this game is great my personal favorite dlc is the heli dlc cause i love to fly helicopters in that game it has also a gokart dlc and thats very fun with friends to race with so yeah i rate 1010
recommended
great game hate that the dlc comes up in my game i would buy for the right price purchased carts maybe if helicopers was priced around $500 that would be exceptable since at this time i dont have it i would like to see the dlc ads in my game gone mods and dlc are great dont get me wrong just no need for it in game
recommended
arma 3 is in my opinion one of the best shooters out there its tactical and takes alot of teamwork you can play singleplayer which is fun but you get the best experiance playing with friends and being able too use your teamwork and tactics to complete tasks the games graphics are stunning especially if you run it on ultra the map is huge it can take you about 30 min just to drive across the game can also be easily edited using the editor and there are many fun game modes such as zeus that you can play all in all i give this game a 9310 its addicting
recommended
amazin buy it play it make love to it
recommended
best army game yet
recommended
this game is great there is a lot of intensew firefights that go on in the main game like the campaign or some multiplayer modes like king of the hill or wasteland but where the real fun comes from is altis life altis life is a rpg multiplayer game mode you are a civilian and u can become a cop or be a rebel and sell drugs very very very fun 1110
recommended
like arma 2 except ly optimized
recommended
if you liked arma 2 you will love this even more

so along time ago i did a review on this game but now im older and i understand more about what i said so heres a new one i love this arma its not as good as cold war or arma 2 but its still just as much fun i play this one alot and as im writing this im playing it i do think you should get the game because its alot of fun and has alot of things you can do in it like king of the hill life coop and much much more what i like to do is go in the editor and make mission for myself and my friends and we have alot of fun with that also theres so many mods if you dont like the factions in the game you can just go online and download more
recommended
i only have 8 hours on this game but ive already had a ton of fun on the game its a great time but you should probably buy it from  or when its on sale

the best army simulater out there arma 3 give you many differnt choises to kill someone weather it be a heliplanetank or by gun its still fun you can play this for hours one thing i reccomend is that you play on a wasteland server save up and get yourself a tank noob before you die

recommended
yet again another epic shooter this game is fun and a big improvement with dlc and online content
recommended
great stragistic shooter and really realistic
recommended
fun game its very boring if you have about a handful of players like 5 or 6 at least on the server i played on first but then i joined a server with 112 player max that had about 97 people already total chaos very exciting altho i eventually got booted from the sarver for side channel spam as it so named it they were kinda dickish with thier rules on that server for some reason still it has great potential  8210
recommended
this game is one of the more realistic games in my libraryprobably the only one while not one of my personal favorites if a semirealistic military combat simulator is what your after then it is a must have if you arent looking for something too realistic there are many public servers that take the game and make it into a new game such as altis life which basically transforms it into a criminal simulator overall it is a fun game if you are looking for what it is designed to be
recommended
first i want to say that this game is amazing and i loved playing during the free weekend however i have a major issue i came onto steam to purchase the game thinking it was still 50% off but when i checked it was full price again after rereading the declaration of the sale and free weekend i realized that it said that the sale ended on monday yet there were people saying they bought it on sunday this is where i got confused the free weekend trial for arma 3 ended on sunday at 10pm the sale itself ended on monday i thought that meant i could purchase it half price on monday but i see that it is full price right now does this mean that in order to actually buy the game because you cant do so while it is in your library during ther free weekend i had to buy it between 10pm and 12pm at night before monday tell me if im right or i misread the article ps sorry if this has to go into a special help section or somethign because i just couldnt find one edit of course i found the help section after i posted the question sorry about that
recommended
this game is not as good as arma 2 and the mods are worse but at least you can play battle royale on it sometimes
recommended
am i brain dead i dont understand all the hype for this game someone please enlighten me the good part is that this seems like a very realistic military sim with stunning visuals the bad where to start the netcode is a joke even an insult to a game which claims to be online players and vehicles teleport around the map colision between vehicles rarely works bullets take 1 second to travel 5 meters i tested it on the rabits on a server with 50 ping the performance oh my the performance on the lowest possible settings i am unable to maintain 30 thirty fps on a server with 50 players get a better pc you ftard this rig can run battlefield 4 maxed out on 64 player servers with the lowest ever recorded fps at 40 the servers and the community are not what i expected at all i expected coordonated military operations the only 2 game modes which seem to be played are altis life rpg which is a cops and robbers open world rpg and king of the hill which turns into a mosh pit with no rules and absolute chaos again someone please explain to me why this game is praised so much edit it is not all bad in this game i do not understand why but on some modes and on some servers the netcode and framerate are alot better also you can find a few people doing what you expect from a game branded as a military sim actual coordonated military operations overall it is a mixed bag but worth a look

someone stole my pants and i blew up my friend with an rpg 1110 would bang ign

best game in my mind started playing arma 2 back when it came out and the amount of mods you can get for both is amazing but this game takes it a bit further i can spend hours playing dress up and making meth in my underwear nothing else compares and if you want to play with milsim groups there are plenty out there you can go diving with the female mod so you can have your babe with you go sky diving then watch the sunset together 1110 will try to hit on that chick again
recommended
it was very fun while i could play it whilst i had for free but now its been removed but overall this game is very fun and the multiplayer is very entertaining i highly recommend this game 910

so along time ago i did a review on this game but now im older and i understand more about what i said so heres a new one i love this arma its not as good as cold war or arma 2 but its still just as much fun i play this one alot and as im writing this im playing it i do think you should get the game because its alot of fun and has alot of things you can do in it like king of the hill life coop and much much more what i like to do is go in the editor and make mission for myself and my friends and we have alot of fun with that also theres so many mods if you dont like the factions in the game you can just go online and download more

1210 best millitary simulator
recommended
this review is from someone new to the arma series and military simulators the most enjoyment i have found from this game has to be the scenario editor if you enjoy map editing andor scenario editing i would highly recommend this game also the multiplayer is quite enjoyable if you find a good team or good scenario the game is graphically gorgeous has some of the best lighting effects ive seen since metro on the downside your character fatigue is ridiculous for being a simulator you will immediately die if shot but on the other hand you have to shoot the ai several times before they will the game can be very complicated at times if youre not familiar with this like myself all in all its a very good game if youre willing to put the time and effort to learn everything
recommended
its good
recommended
fcking best game ever and lots of diffrent game modes
recommended
really great fps game theres not much wrong with this game it is really fun to play
recommended
great game it is addictive and there are lots of great community made mods to play with when you and they range from the interesting to the rididulous highly recommended
recommended
a great step forward from arma ii arma iii is a beautiful military simulator with infinite possibilities there are hundreds if not thoudands of things you can do in this game no matter what your taste and more are being added every day with the steam workshop this is a musthave game for anyone who enjoys a good military shooter however bear in mind this is an arma game there will be desync and there will be other quirky bugs related to the physics engine allinall though i believe the fun that can be had in this game far out weigh the small problems that you will find i highly recommend this game
recommended
damn it colonel shut up
recommended
amazing game but there are some problems glitchy missions the fcking ai cant walk past a goddmn wall and i have to restart the whole thing failure to present the battle eye login thing it says its running but its invisible and i cant play the fcking game becuase of it now
recommended
its great
recommended
it said a long time ago the free version was out for a day left i download it and the sell was over i play it 1 time an now it says have to buy the game now whats up with that
recommended
anyone who is looking for a realistic military experience unlike call of duty and stunning graphics this is the game for you because this game is warit is hard to play without exitment when the health in this game is realistic meaning one stray bullet can mean deathso yes i recomend this game it has alot of content and even more with the steam workshopit is a very good game with a great communityand it is probably one of the best games i have played on steam
recommended
ive only played a little i like it alright i guess
recommended
i do not own this game 1010 would bang
recommended
only played a few hours but id buy it again if i could
recommended
arma is a great game sometimes it can get boring but doing ops or campaign mission that are custom can be a blast to do with your friends overall i would recommend this game to all of my friends
recommended
great game and fun gamemodes

recommended

recommended
got in a truck didnt have a wheel 1010 game
recommended
110 would play arma 2 again
recommended
ive only played this in wasteland but i would say it is amazing
recommended
this game is one of the more realistic games in my libraryprobably the only one while not one of my personal favorites if a semirealistic military combat simulator is what your after then it is a must have if you arent looking for something too realistic there are many public servers that take the game and make it into a new game such as altis life which basically transforms it into a criminal simulator overall it is a fun game if you are looking for what it is designed to be
recommended
first i want to say that this game is amazing and i loved playing during the free weekend however i have a major issue i came onto steam to purchase the game thinking it was still 50% off but when i checked it was full price again after rereading the declaration of the sale and free weekend i realized that it said that the sale ended on monday yet there were people saying they bought it on sunday this is where i got confused the free weekend trial for arma 3 ended on sunday at 10pm the sale itself ended on monday i thought that meant i could purchase it half price on monday but i see that it is full price right now does this mean that in order to actually buy the game because you cant do so while it is in your library during ther free weekend i had to buy it between 10pm and 12pm at night before monday tell me if im right or i misread the article ps sorry if this has to go into a special help section or somethign because i just couldnt find one edit of course i found the help section after i posted the question sorry about that
recommended
the zeus dlc was apparently installed on 12311969

recommended
i have never played this game but steam still wanted me to write a review i give this game a 0\0
recommended
great game
recommended
fantastic but unfortunatly you need to find a good group to play with but worth it all the same
recommended
arma 3 is a good game for everyone who likes the feeling of beeing in a warzone or just a solider driving cars and flying planes all around the map makes it a fun game that is hard to get sick of
recommended
buy it as  you never try you never know
recommended
it has to be one of the best games ive played and i have played almost every single console and pc game out there just literally everything about the game is incredible the realism the gameplay just its a truly amazing game i paid $5999 im fine with that price for future expansion of the game constantly updating the game i currently play arma 3 epoch and i really enjoy the mod most of my hours are from the mod and i havent even tried the other mods yet highly recommend the game to anyone unless your a call of duty fan boy or your a young kid as soon as the marksman dlc comes out of course i will be getting that so if your on the fence with this game dont even think about not getting it the one and only one con to this game is gonna have to be the opimization if you dont have a intel chipset its gonna be very hard to run this game i currently am using a amd 8350 and i only get 30low 40 fps in multiplayer server standard settings with a gtx 960 so with me loving this game soo much i am currently saving a little money to purchase a intel i5 4690k so i can run this game at ease with my card so if you have a intel chipset and a decent graphics card you should be fine with this game and i highly highly recommend gettng it if you dont like the vanilla game the mods make it 200% better men play arma boys play battlefield kids play call of duty
recommended
i did not have alot of time to play the game but the time i did play everything was pretty cool the game aswell as the community not alot of 10 year old boys screaming in multiplayer wich was also a plus so i recommended this decent piece of a game to all you dip
recommended
in a game all about war surprisingly you dont get much action unless your in a tank or in singleplayer the best moment ive ever had with this game is where your about to evac and your helecopter gets shot down and you and the survivors with no comucation to hq have to walk 10km while carrying a dead body of your comrade all the way back to the spawn just walking and talking with your fellow soldiers 810 agreenarrow
recommended
after getting towed by a heli and dropped from 300m in a armored vehicle to then bounce off the surface of the ocean and hit the heli descending to see what happend to me i can recommend this game 1110 would get towed again
recommended
i rarely play online and dont do much single player i have no idea how i have 100 hours it must be good
recommended
a little fusterating at first but once you get the hang of its alot of fun i had to rebind some of the keys to make me more comfortable but other then that i love this game
recommended
good campaign exellent graphics fun rp
recommended
i liked the game at first i liked the details i liked the hud i liked the control setup and so on what i did not like though is the fact that it is not that good at multicore rendering so if you have an amd 8core processor then it may lag a little bit for some reason 6core processors work better than 8core processors on this game even if all the cores ahve 4000mhz both on the 6core and 8core
recommended
its a very good game
recommended
cool cool 1010
recommended
the war game of my dreams
recommended
the mods really make this game awesome
recommended
bloody bloody fun game a couple really fun gamemodes especially altis life 70% of all my hours on this game were on altis life definitely worth the buy just try not to get banned ps would have atleast 21 more hours if not for the cheeky nandos dean hall for globally banning me deez nutz
recommended
if you have the computer to run it prepare to have the best time of your life i have played arma 2 since 1 year ago dayz mod and other server just make me smile memories of executing russians with norwegian guys running over people with cars and dying from hilarious bugs arma 2 was amazing later on i got arma 3 every penny of the 60 bucks it cost this game was worth it it is so far my favorite game and when you play with others you will create memories that you will never forget lets just say arma 3 is the best game i have ever played and ive played a lot of games
recommended
well this is a good game but i got the game to play a mod called atlis life but i guess they added it into the game and i dont know how to play it 
recommended
just buy a tank and you will love it
recommended
famous last words is that a grena
recommended
lot of amazing mods i think anyone who plays this will love altis life so a great time with friends and who doesnt enjoy stealing other peoples organs just make sure you have a decent rig or you wont have a very good time 1010 would play again d
recommended
great game the life servers are amazing
recommended
i just realized ive logged in 263 hours into this game without giving it a review i have adhd so its really hard to keep my attention especially in games a hobby i love let me just say arma 3 has taken 263 of my hours while the upcoming game has only taken 180 of my hours really is there anything else i need to say about this game
recommended
very fun and enjoyable game i would recommend a lot
recommended
buy it gibe moneyzz to arma
recommended
besides the fact your enemies turn into slender man everytime you shoot them this game is by far best arma besides combat operations and arma 2 but graphics do matter cause in low settings on arma 3 is like medium on arma 2 also this game is very futuristic in a way the csat are the closest thing to the modern day terrorists and the aaf are your greek resistance the only modern thing in this game is nato they use commanche helis mraps ghost hawks and who ever is wondering whats a ghost hawk it was the prototype heli used to transport the navy seals to kill osama finally the game modes are crazy fun like escape from stratis and they have steam workshop so you can download missions instead of making one your self they also have pvp but due to desync it wont be as fun as playing coop with friends the campaign in this isnt like the one from previous armas its more dynamic it tells the story of how nato is being attacked by aaf and the csat i wont spoil anything because this is a review not the campaign
recommended
best game on the market
recommended
1221 hours and counting of fun and heartache

recommended
not much to say about arma iii its the best in milsim that the world has ever seen a musthave for every pc gamer
recommended
these graphics are better then my eyesight but the game runs like crap
recommended
this game is the best game ever you can even make your own missions and share to the world i made 2 you can engage in tactical combat with a group of strangers or with friends when i say tactical i mean it  if you can get your head around the keys on the keyboard which takes a while i once stripped down to my underpants in this game and pretended to be dead in middle of the street and a group of guys wondered past me then i picked my gun up and blasted them all hahaha killed by a underpants man lol they even looked at me to see if i was dead its simply amazing
recommended
the most realiztic shooter ive played it is very well done and very tactical only down side for me is there isa 3rd person view option
recommended
a great addition to the arma series great gameplay and controls with an ever expanding arsenal and range of vehicles graphics are top notch with tones of new mods coming out all the time too a must buy for fans of the genre
recommended
i thought this game was very well designed the levels were structured very well but the graphics were kind of weak
recommended
the best and biggest milsim sandbox out there if youre a fan of pc gaming this should be in your library
recommended
played it a little thought it was alright
recommended
i had the lucky chance of playing arma 3 last weekend  which i had to compromise and complete my godlike mission of downloading it got on a server  got shot in the head in wasteland for missteping into a territory which was 1 meter and amazingly there shot two ppl got ultimate loot and died 1010 would fap again
recommended
this is a great game with huge map and its very realistic there are already zombie mods what makes this game even better so for 45 you actually get more than one game one of the best fpss currently on market
recommended
great game youll need a pretty good pc as the graphics are fing amazing 1010
recommended
really good fun plenty of modsexpansions & like the other arma games will provide many hours of entertainment

this game ruined my life 1010 would enroll in virtual military school and finally enlist after 3 months of boot camp again but for real this game is the ultimate military sandbox the modding community and player interaction really make this game imagine every scripted epic combat scene and now imagine that actually happening nonscripted and with all real players just buy this  trust me
recommended
amazing game as a huge fan of the arma series i have to say this is a great addition i cant wate until they add more content
recommended
great game

very well done military combat sim rix 910
recommended
i have a few hours in thisits okay
recommended
damn my gameselection standard increases extremely due to arma3 im lacking games
recommended
great game cant go wrong with it low end pcs may not run the game very well but still will get at least half of what the game has to offer great game to play with friends some of my favorite game modes are  alitis life kothking of the hill and some 10mil start servers most realistic war simulator out there its just an amazing game overall cant go wrong with it considering all the game modes and side features it has to offer i would recomend playing the game a little while untill you get used to the game before buying the dlcs since some of them are pricey and you wouldnt want to waste 40 odd bucks or so on something you arent going to play  1010 purple stickers
recommended
love it
recommended
its okay i guess arma ii 910
recommended
a game i would recommend to people since alot of stuff has happend to it over the last mouth or two having some well devloped mods such as epoch arma 3 life breaking point and many more mission files you can put hours of game time into
recommended
one of the best shooting rpg games i have played
recommended
i recommend this game but be warned there are a lot of bad things mainly due to some clunky controls stiff animations and engine limitationsas well as performance issues online theres nothing out there like it its one of a kind really its a massively open world military simulator the scale is huge and this is reflected perfectly in its online modes and mods created by the modding community the downside of this is they have one huge map altis and thats all thats really thereno one plays stratis which is the only other map and its a lot smaller so youre pretty much stuck with the same map same buildings same roads same cities etc etc it would have been nice to have a bit of variety at least from an official source as opposed to having to download maps from the modding communitywhich are mostly maps imported from arma 2 this isnt to say that altis is boring or a badly designed map  its quite the opposite  but having spent 100 hours on the same map you do wish for a bit more especially after two years of developmentincluding alpha and an expansionseason pass the scale of the game was really brought to light in one of the first mods created for the game back when it was in alpha the coop game mode invade & annex this mode basically opened up the entire map for deployment from a central base complete with side missions that were entirely up to the players100 or so to take out missions required teamwork coordination squad based compositions transport management scouting air support and heavy and light armour to complete you would be deployed anywhere on the map with your squad to take on an objective and it was purely simulation based where you followed the chain of command to tackle objectives requested support and had to wait for airinfantryarmoured support to arrive there really was nothing like it in any other game and still isnt as far as im aware mods speaking of mods this game has a lot of popular mods which one could rightly assume may even spawn standalone games of themselves given the huge amount of interest in them and the sheer amount of players who buy arma iii specifically for some of the mods on offer to name a few king of the hill  mosh put style game mode where three teams fight for supremacy over an objectmost often entire cities or towns by having as many players as possible from their team in the objective killing enemies to lower their presence altis lifearma 3 life  a life rpg where you eat team up with other players and take on roles in the virtual world of altis ranging from picking apples mining fishing to becoming a rebel mugger or even joining the police or military to enforce the law and fight off rebels its an rp experience so youre forced to act in character to make the mode more immersiveno random killing you have to engage and have reason to shootingkilling people battle royale  just like the movie battle royale or for the more modern crowd its similar to the hunger games you parachute onto the island land and try to find weapons and supplies to survive and kill other players the objective is to be the last man surviving a zone is marked and it gets smaller as the game progresses if youre not in the marked area by the time youre given you die the mods are really entertaining and while some are very simple and add onto the base experience they make the base game that much better although i would question why some mods simply were not developed by bohemia to begin with and released with the game as standard controls and animations controls are pretty janky the animations are stiff and can get you killed it takes a long time to learn all the controls and then even longer to relearn the controls for specific servers that have keys bound to different keys than what other servers have as standard its not a bad thing having all these controls as they do make a difference but whats bad is the animations which force you into a full animation loop which is slow cumbersome and essentially makes you a free kill for instance if you want to holster your gun your character will stop he will then initiate the animation put the gun away then he will stand up only then will you be able to move your character again and you cant interrupt these animations you cant even run or walk while theyre being performed which is simply frustrating and downright bad design if youre in a firefight and mistakenly take out a pistol instead of your rifle prepare for five seconds  if youre lucky not to die while this is happening  of animation hell where youre left with pulling your hair out screaming at the screen while youre in the middle of the battlefield standing up and rather hilariously carelessly taking your primary from your shoulder with zero s given needless to say the animations are pretty bad in most regards animations that cant be interrupted and require you to spend 5seconds performing the most simplest of animations is just bad by any stretch of the imagination i dont think anyone can defend it and ive never heard anyone try to performance issues performance is a huge setback for this game for the main reason that online performance the core of the game that people are here for depends entirely on the server youre on and the scripts it uses if its a poor server that doesnt get reset every so often youll see your frames drop by 5060% you could be at 60fps and then due to the poor server youre down to 1520fps no matter what computer you have its just one of those things you have to accept you will also experience random freezes and random dips in performance even if youre on a good server some freezes can last from 2 seconds to 10 seconds or even longer this has nothing to do with your computer it doesnt happen so often that youll find yourself dying over and over but it happens enough to be notable and strangely enough it doesnt seem to happen in firefights but mostly when youre sitting around doing nothing or just driving on an empty road its questionable to say the least having said that im running the game on close to ultra settings with an fps of around 3040 for the most part on a windows 7 64bit pc no ssd 4gb ddr3 ram an i5750 cpu at stock speed267ghz and an amd r9 290 4gb graphics card theres still slowdowns and performance still largely depends on the server im on and what mod it is in single player my frames will easily double and be consistent with no performance drops single player i probably should have started off with single player but i felt a pros over cons is the best way for the flow of this review the single player isnt great if im to be honest enemy ai will spot you from a few milesor kms away before you even have a chance to see them youll be told by the ai leader to target and kill an enemy at x distance or to proceed to location y only to die because you cant see the three aimbot ai perched three kilometers away on a hill with assault rifles seemingly sniping at you youll die a lot and it will only feel like a cheap death deaths are just cheap in the sp campaign which is reflected in one of the earlier missions where you enter a minefield and get blown up instantly which is the games way of saying trial and error youll know next time its cheap and its bad design for a game simulation or not the story itself isnt great either conclusion its worth the money theres no game out there like it and theres no game that offers as much as arma iii does in terms of sheer scale and simulation theres a few negatives to go against the game but ultimately this is definitely something you should have in your game library if you even remotely enjoy shooters or military shooters of any kind
recommended
arma iii is a combat simulator it creates an envioroment where you can perform and learn the basics of the movement of a military soldier the campaign is really good there is nothing wrong with it at all except from where i find it hard at some cases but overall it holds a realistic simulation of how its like i also love multiplayer on arma iii people can transform coop gamemodes to a realistic enviroment in multiplayer like some people can form squads and they like to make it look like a real squad which contains planning tatical commands things like that it makes the game look real arma iii was released 7 months ago but grows a better game each time there are certain amount of bugs and glitches in it but its very rare the bugs or glitches occur the game is quite expensive i know its 3599 but its good to spend money on a brilliant game like this if you want to spend more on it you can buy digital deluxe upgrade for 899 i recommend buying the deluxe edition for 3999 make sure you like what you are buying of the deluxe edition when you buy this game i hope you have alot of fun thanks
recommended
what more to say than you will loose yourself in how immersive and realistic this game can be
recommended
well what can i say arma 3 is a one of a kind game its a twist on the average fast paced fps dont get it if you think youll survive a bombardment of bullets and walk away perfectly fine one bullet to the chest and youre done this game is a slow paced shooter its takes patience to play you cant fight two soldiers at once but what the game does offer is some of the best graphics and stellar gunplaythis game needs a lot to run the only cons are the team mates most are there to play and help you some asshats are straight from cod and will shoot you and not help the team two tips you need to know this  is tough your kd doesnt mean jack  to you its about the team winning second its about team work telling people where tanks and soldiers are location is a must team work people is the key to victory
recommended
hands down the best combat sim out on the market on a scale of 110 i give it an 11
recommended
here are some positive & negative things about the game sexy graphics huge scale map realistic combat character customisation really bad car models not very many weapons too lazy with vehicle differences on a scale of 110 i would give this game an 810 just because of the modding community behind the game arma 3 pretty much never gets boring because you always have new mods coming out and giving you new experiences to enjoy

sgt jackson 310515 final entry stranded we have been caught in a bitter fire fight lasting over 2 days ambushed as we attempted to flee from the island by an elite infantry unit we sort refuge in an old farm house my men and i fought bravely holding back the enemy contact to hq has proved fruitless they have abandoned the island and the few soldiers that remain my thoughts in this quiet period turn to family and friends back home my lovely wife and two twin boys if they somehow get this journal i want them to know i love them dearly i cannot dwell too long i can hear the enemy i hold back the tears to keep face in front of my men we have seen that the enemy do not take prisoners of war in fact they make an example of captured soldiers in a truly horrific manner when captured you are stripped of your items and forced into a vehicle drove by the ai the driver is given a way point from one end of altis to the other you are not allowed to leave the vehicle or drive the vehicle yourself they are barbarians my men and i are down to our last rounds of ammunition i myself only have my side arm we know we will not survive the next assault i have thought about saving one round for myself but i dont want those s out there to have that kind of satisfaction my engineer kevin a brave man with a mustache worthy of a medal on its own merit he approached me and told me he has one explosive charge left we discuss our options knowing full well our situation kevin johnson taylor and i have decided the last man standing will detonate the charge we will go down fighting to the last the charge is set im not a religious man but if there is a god may he have mercy on our souls i hear the enemies battle cry farewell despite the occasional clumsy ai this game is that realistic just fantastic buy it now

the game its self is pretty  its altis life that makes this game wwwaltislifeukcouk

i think this game is good
recommended
in my opinion much better than any of the previous arma games first and foremost where do i start the animations the graphics and the physics are all improved perfectly and it just feels like you are at war the optimization gives you much more freedom to tweak graphical settings the coop just has to be the best feature knowing that everyone depends on you and you depend on everyone as a team

hello everyone i just want to say one thing buuy this game just no questions why just buy the game i might have 90 hours on it but trust me you will have alot more then me once you buy it and its way more fun with friends so heres why you should buy it if you dont belive me then let me tell you why pros 1 alot of people play the game so it wont be hard to find a server you like or someone to play with 2 so many things to do like atlis life  which is like living in arma iii  and wastland and much much more 3 so many guns and vehicles cons 1 you might need a good desktop  not a laptop unless it amazing  also no matter what specs you have the game might not run full ultra 2 you need a good intel card so like a i5 but i recommend a i7 4790k anything below this you might have some problems cause arma runs fully on cpu and a little bit of gpu so i recommend a good gpu so you dont bottleneck you pc but overall this is a great game and enjoy d

never losses playability so much to do best game on steam 1010 will lead my friends in to combat again

i went into this game knowing that the game company bohemia were and are idiots i know this by looking at reviews for dayz and seeing people talk about how they use the same engine over and over and it causes problems they think that they always know best and that their games are flawlesseven though its clear to millions it isnt and they refuse to listen to their customers with that in mind i downloaded and played compared to what ive played of arma ii the demo which was bugged arma iii is a lot more polished graphics are great the sounds of guns firing is crisp on both firing and the receiving fire end and the open map is massive getting items and interacting with vehiclesitems is unlike anything ive played in any game unfortunately the learning curve is really steep you go in basically clueless and have to figure out a lot yourself they have tutorial pop ups for the campaign and part of the reason why i say these guys arent smart is they originally released it without any singleplayer except that it pops up in the middle of what you are doing they could save a lot of time just giving a regular laid back tutorial mission like virtually every other game does and they did do this in the arma ii demo your teams ai is bad they love to run out alone and get shot to death leaving you to fend for yourself and enemies are very smart they stick together theyre patient and man are they deadly accurate nice challenge for sure but i wish they were realistically accurate even from a huge distance they rarely miss and most carry assault rifles with dot sights multiplayer is much much worse if you havent done the campaign first but its still as equally confusing as going into the campaign i mustve pressed about every button to try and chat with people with no success i tried to configure it inalso no success and the loading time getting into any server is quite long understandably long though since its a huge map and theres an objective i think for this portion playing a previous arma game would be best since they expect you to have played them apparently there are definitely a lot of problems with this game ai should be fixed more evenly for a smoother experience no i am not saying make the game easier i love the challenge and the adrenaline but id love to know i can count on my fellow soldiers and a set tutorial should be in place assuming people know everything regardless of playing every arma game or not is always a bad idea there is one thing no one could deny the arma games are one of a kind no one has come closer than this franchise to having the most realistic war experience but please bohemiastop being self centered  and listen to your customers and take their ideas and complaints into consideration other than the problems i had fun playing but i wouldnt recommend it unless you know arma and how it all works at the same time though i do recommend this game it is not a casual shooter in any way all it takes is a couple of bullets and your team could and can be wiped out flanking is truly your best friend and your worst enemy and communication is just as vital in singleplayer as multiplayer the experience cant be matched edit ive finished some singleplayer and had much better experiences with multiplayer its a must buy in my opinion by this point i dont revoke anything that ive said before but once you know how to do things its fun to save newbies time left ctrl  g allow you to switch grenades and left ctrl  right mouse button allow you to switch scopes when you have two youll pretty much need a gps in order to know where you are and where everyone else is usually and  is how you type chat in the servers cheers

this game ruined my life 1010 would enroll in virtual military school and finally enlist after 3 months of boot camp again but for real this game is the ultimate military sandbox the modding community and player interaction really make this game imagine every scripted epic combat scene and now imagine that actually happening nonscripted and with all real players just buy this  trust me
recommended
the models are simply awesome the sounds are reused on some guns and you need a motherfcking warmachine to run it with only 30 fps in medium resolution

was 810 without dlc weapons because of optimization issues but since marksman dlc with dlc weapons hitting 1 hit kills made the game easier for casuals which made wasteland excluding samatra king of the hill and some altis life servers lame it is currently 610 above average because multiplayer is ruined and isnt really fun anymore but i still recommend the game campaign is great physics is great 
recommended
spent hours in campaign doing scouting missions of no importance carefully select a loadout in cooperative and get heli ride to objective only to get shot down by a bad pilot flying too high used real life tactics with a handful of good players to take out objectives spent half an hour crawling around with a lynx in wasteland mode to snipe a single guy 900m away and then spent another hour waiting to ambush a group of players with claymores and take all their money it has plenty of issues and is a niche game but if you like the idea of getting some friends together to conduct ambushes on poor unsuspecting people with half an hour of no combat then youll like this game slow is good in this game 1010 would assault a church again

i belive this game is the best army simulation games you can get and the game is worth the money i have played 568 hours of the game and im still not bored of playing its because there is a lot of things to explore and not just that you can download things from the steam workshop and you can put up things you have made to the steam workshop to share with your friends or to share to everybody

i used to like arma quite a bit number two and three i was one of those players that would hop servers looking for a good time try and do something sort of coherent get my  annoyed in by a certain portion of the player base that should not be mentioned cough ginsberg cough i had my fun with the game and that was about it but then i hit the real meat of the game community being able to play with a group of buddies is the peak of enjoyment from atleast vanilla arma you toss armas beautiful modding community into the mix and this becomes a very different ballgame on the same field when i happened upon a small friendly community that i would soon dub a bunch of jolly s i fell in love with arma on a completely new and fantastic level about 600650 of my hours logged where in the span of a year playing with these guys and it was a fantastic time the more you have available to you like a personal server the mod base ability to use the editor the more depth the game has that all compound on the imagination of you and your buddies wanna screw around go ahead and run across altis with your  hanging out thumb up your  barfing rainbows on those who stand in your way im not saying your can do this because you may be able to put that together if your determined enough or if someone else is want to do something paraseriously with proper radios that can be really crappy because who the hell put that mountain there call signs etc go ahead this game can be a pretty cool thing to hop on and kill  on and it could also be a real ing hoot of a time wrecking  with your own band of jolly s if you can handle the realistic mechanics and enjoy this style of fps i say this game is a must have if you struggle with the games that aspire to be highly realistic this probably wont be for you some other very useful traits of character to have going into this game is the maturity to play cooperatively with atleast a neutral disposition when playing with others and patience to sit through some long chopper or car rides which can hand in hand with maturity and being able to contain yourself

arma 3 is a major improvement over arma 2 even if you think it lacks content is wich you got to remember arma 2 on launch in 2009 had lack of content but bohemia interactive has always done this they always add more content in updates and even after release just look at arma cold war assault this game is clearly a big improvement over its predacessors even is faithful to its roots even though most do not like the futerstic setting of arma 3 it was something different to try but the campaigns it self was fun to play through i enjoyed the different styles of the campaign of the situations i wont go into spoilers but the way the campaigns are played is good example of giving a live world it does lack coop but with good reasons it was good playthrough i had i do like the story it was way better than arma2 it was what arma2 tried to acheive but they really improved it on arma 3 thanks to this studio we have a great game and still gets support and added content through updates and the gameplay might change slightly from time to time and if you have performance issues just head to bohemia interactive forums they will get in touch asap and let you know if they working on a solution for you great support and great game and as stated earlier a major improvement over its predacessor i have no issues with the game it self because my faith in this studio is very strong and secure because i been playing arma series for a long time and all i can say is they are dedicated to the fans now for the serious notes this is a simulator with great dynamics and ballistics and a whole real life of islands to explore even go under water in the sea its not a gimmick its how you use your tactics that counts its really good way of sneaking and inflitration the game is still being improved yes things will change over time give it time and you have more than what you payed for because you supported a studio as stated before dedicated to their fans and they are interacting with the community

recommended
game of the year

i dont have a review for this game yeti dont have a review for this game yet holy crap i cant believe i havent reviewed this game yet this game is honestly my favorite game for more reasons than any other game could possibly deliver arma 3 is a near future set game that delivers combined arms operations for a massive number of players this game is definitly a more mature game this game reward tactics cordination patience and attention to detail this isnt a shooter for the masses honestly arma is a niche game for a niche audience sure it has down falls but they can be overlooked if you give it a chance and really experience what this game can do providing massive options and a massive map is only part of the magic that is arma 3 a bunch of ingredients are useless without a good kitchen arma 3s kitchen is the editor the editor allows anyone to create anyone to make missions with almost any asset in game this provides endless replayablility as well as an excellent way for peopel to create missions to play with friends the game play isnt perfect it can be slow and nothing is going to be over the top like battlefield or cod but its does provide an excelllent military simulation where every death will be infuriating but acceptable and every victory glorious but hard fought the maps is over 219km squared but alot of it feels empty and the parts that arent feel really empty with the map more would be less and i could go on but i wont for the sake of brevity the ai leave something to be desired friendly ai seem about as smart as a bag of rocks except the rocks win every time they dont follow orders well if they do its almost certainly cluncky and awkward the opposing ai are just as bad if they dont see you from a mile away and kill you with a cold bore headshot theyre sure to hit the deck and see right throught the bush you are hiding in and return fire accordingly there is more to this game than what appears when you first launch it the mod community is massive there are mods for just about everything which makes anything possible these games totally expand the game to insane new heights and some change the game all together the people who play this game are amazing i have made some awesome friends because of this game and continue to make more as i go playing with people who compliment your play style improve the game ten fold are a critical part in the arma 3 experience this series has been around for over 9 years and continues to grow and mature with every installation and so does the community i love this game and the people who play it i dont think ill ever stop so heres to the next 9 years of arma games 1010

battle royale mod launcher requires a powerful cpu to maintain decent fps even at the lowest graphical settings especially in cities

its a great game with good campagne great multiplayer work fine rare glitches yes arma with rare glitches i only with more weapons and vehicles becourse arma 3 is in a close future whe got some rly cool vehicles and weapons but i miss hummer with 50c or good old black hawk also some weapons like m4 or normal ak47

recommended
this game is amazing with its various gamemodes such as king of the hill wasteland altis life and invade and annexall made by the communitythis game is very fun to play with friends online single player is suprisingly good for an arma title so brownie points to the campaign dev team but i will say this the game is a constant work in progress i have seen it progress since alpha and even now they are adding units and they are not yet done with the campaign still but as long as it mantains the level we have been seeing then i think its worth it 1010
recommended
tried it out on free weekend cant stop playing who needs sleep when you have arma 3
recommended
got into a plane and accidently ejected dooming my squad
recommended
i got sent to jail for saying hi to a cop 1110 would role play again

i know this is only beta but i already know that this is going to be one of the greatest multiplayer to date the combat simulation is perfect the tactical gameplay is perfect the squad system is perfect the open world is perfect the graphics are perfect you will need a good computer to handle this game 1010 buy it
recommended
nothing like cod or battlefield its absolutely killer on a pc i have a amd fx 6300 8gb ram and a geforce 760 4gb i get about 2035 fps on medium settings on multiplayer soon to be ugrading to intel and a 900 series geforce gpu other than that if you have a good pc buy this game 910

summary tensions rise as nato peacekeeping forces begin to leave the republic of altis a strategic faultline between crumbling european influence and a powerful resurgent east but when a key radar facility drops off the grid a mediterranean flashpoint risks escalating into global conflict also gameplay the engine is a big step up over arma 2 things like the adjustable stances dynamic fog physics and underwater terrain add tons of possibilities in the game setting this is one of my major problems with the game scifi and simulation dont mix well while i know that everything in the game is possible the fact remains that most vehicles and weapons are pure speculation the equipment not being used in present day armed forces partly kills the immersion for me hopefully ace mod will fix this sp content the campaign so far is awesome bi managed to improve the storytelling and the gameplay as well as the realism mp performance in mp can be horrible depending on the gametype and server i dont often find populated servers with interesting gametypes as there only seem to be 2 popular gametypes on public servers collapse
recommended
would buy

absolutly amazing army simulator great with friends if you wanna try something tactical great game and love the custom maps which people make very high quality and considered and can keep for entertained forever great game 910 con the only con i have is the ai is very skilled when it comes to where you are they know very much but thats the only downside i have

arma 3 is an awesome game i have not played it much but the amount of time i have been playing i have had sooo much fun if you are looking for a war simulator here you have it
recommended
this game is legit and amazing the devs try not to call it a sim but its as close as you can get while still being a game its very realistic with damage and weight models body armor and helmets give a degree of protection the same applies to the variation of vehicles in the game the 2 maps are huge and there are plans for dlc in the future which will no doubt add on to that speaking of addons the giant mod community for the game is always hard at work making new missions weapons and vehicles to add into the game free of charge there is endless replayablility with this game and if youre a shootermilitary game fan then this should be in your library honestly if the game was more optimised insane cpu usage for projectile physics and ai decision making i wouldnt even play half of the other shooters that are out today because arma does it all and more pick this game up
recommended
its like call of duty and battlefield ign

this game is ing amazing you should buy this amazing game

arma is a game about choices and split second reactions that mean life or death i never play alone when i play arma and i expect the same for you if your a fan of dayz without the huge consequances of dayz then this is a great game for you you fly planes drive cars mow enemies down all while playing on a huge map with lots of enemy players its hyper realisitc with things like engine failure wheels popping non regenitive health food and water levels and of course the fear of war the three game modes i suggest you play is altis life wasteland and the battle royale mod all of those are great you can see by the hours ive put into this game how much i love it i plan on putting many more hours into it in the near future

got to play this game for 2 hours on the free weekend i had this game already on my wishlist and now i want it more
recommended
the free weekend for this game gave me the experience i needed to be convinced to purchase it as i was playing the game all i could think about was how much time i had left to play it and i enjoyed every moment of it your experience may vary because of the different servers you can go on that have different play styles to them its a beautiful game and i cant see myself getting tired of it anytime soon try to play this game with friends it makes it 100x better
recommended
i played arma 3 on this free weekend i thought it was just like mw3 or battlefeild but then i relized it was an experience like no other game i have played i would rate this game 100 out of 100 trust me its awsome thank you for the free weekend so i can try this game
recommended

recommended
i loved the little time i had with this for some reason steam wont let me play it for free for the free weekend maybe because its already in my library anyways this is not your runofthemill cod nonsense

recommended
710 has the potential to be a better game with time if it is still supported
recommended
what are you doing stalker
recommended
my favrate game recomended at six stars
recommended
from the outside looking in arma iii imitates the best and worst aspects of postmodern war the vast majority of your time in this game will be frustration from shear amount of bordom that is until a firefight breaks out & its the most intense game youve ever played the juxtaposition between these two emotions is not unlike every headcam video of a soldier at war that are all over the internet so if that at all interests you id say buy arma iii
recommended
best arma series game ever 3 when it on a free weekend and yet still better but i wish to get the game when it was free but way to expensive i would recommend the game for those people who dont have it
recommended

i love how there is so many other gamemodes to play my favorite to play is atlis life its just so much fun and i cant see any problem with this game
recommended
ok i think generally this game is a truly beatiful modern warfare simulator this is really one of the best milsim game ever but there is a cons and of course there are situations that force you to say something like this wtf  my ai teammate stuck in a lying box  seriously   especially if the situation is tough and you need fire support from your team so ai is really stupid its a rare thing for your teammates to properly find optimal waypoint even if they just walking behind you and of course question of the overall game performance 4770k16gb ram2xsli 780 and frame drops to 45 fps when there are huge explosions again i want to ask the developers  seriosly  ok guys just optimize the performance please  this is a really great game suffering from bugs and really bad netcode
recommended
arma 3 is the best ive seen in the series my only really gripe is they didnt get the liscences to actual military equipment and firearms and as a result there seems to be a lack of weapon variety furthermore i feel that the factions are too symmetrical in an age of assymetrical warfare regardless you can certainly have some fun with this game especially with the massive editor and steam workshop support lastly i challange the developers to implement female characters given the recent advancements in the united states regarding female soldiers serving in combat guys dont fall behind on history

i joined a wasteland server by samatra today and heres my story i spawn in the middle of nowhere i spawn an atv and crash i died next i spawn in a city with 3 people in front of me i kill all three a tank rolls up i blow up from a tank shell then i spawn in another city with 2 cars right in front of me two people show up with assault rifles i shoot both in the face with a pistol and i take their loot then i see an armored vehicle with a mounted machine gun i find a heavy machine gun in the vehicle and another assualt rifle i repair the vehicle ride off and capture a base which shortly after gets raided by 5 people i jump in the gunner seat mow the enemies down and hold off the base until i get sniped by a guy a mile away i spawn in a town close to the place i just died i jack a guys car and i drive up to my captured base when i get there a guy takes me hostage takes my weapons strips me of my clothes takes me into a room and he instantly gets shot from the same sniper that killed me i run out naked take a gun rush a guy that was in my base and i get shot in the back from a paratrooper i then spawn in an airfield with only a pistol and a medkit i shoot a guy camping in a building with an assault rifle i take his gun i mow down 8 other people i take a rocket launcher from a guy i just killed and camp on the roof of a building i then see a transport helicopter with 10 people inside i take out my rocket launcher lock on slowly and i let the rocket hit the side of the helicopter five seconds later the whole airfield shakes with the boom and i walk away like a badass leaving the wreckage of the helicopter and letting the bodies burn inside the twisted hunk of metal then i get shot by a fresh spawn with a pistol and one magazine all of this in just 26 hours of the game 888 ign needs more guns and splosions  in all seriousness though this game is amazing it definately takes patience to play though and sometimes it can turn into running simulator 2015 the map is huge the servers are great optimization is absolutely terrible and i mean it my specs are pretty high end and my rig can barely handle the game on very high at about 30 fps if you are looking for great fun play this game love the mechanics love the thirst and hunger mechanics as well as the gunplay not your average call of duty or battlefield shooter this is legit if you have read this review all the way down here then just buy it already

have not played much of this game yet but from what i have experienced so far it was over my expectiations i bought this game to play roleplay servers mainly and battle royale well i hoped on the rp servers for a bit and just did nothing much but hopped in the back of a guys big truck and we drove it into the ocean it was pretty entertaining and battle royale i have yet to try it but from videos on youtube it looks just like hunger games on lets say minecraft but way better with gunscarsetc coming over from garrys mod roleplay servers to arma roleplay servers and all i can say is why didnt i find out about theese awesome servers on arma 3 before 1010 amazing game highly recommend if you enjoy roleplay or hunger games like experiences

i absolutely love this game the community is huge and amazing with vast amount of servers to be chosen from altis life wasteland domination and other common game modes like conquest dm etc and with a large support for moding the game can be played litteraly forever with mods coming out nearly every day on a popular website armaholic but even the base game is entertaining just enough with servers with different game mode types that are updated regulary and if you dont like what is given to you you have the option to go out on your way and make your own missions or mods and play them with your friends the game looks very nice on ultra settings there are no major issues with the game besides very small and usually unoticable bugs that are often fixed very quickly through updates the game has a range of interesting dlc such as the new kart dlc orginaly as an april fools joke was released due to popular demand and the game still has upcoming and anticipated dlc i would definetely recommend this game to anyone as it offers a wide range of options of how and what you would like to do in the game
recommended
i rly want this game some one gift me it d

its a damn amazing game so much fun when your roleplaying fighting or just playing zeus with your buddies i do feel they tried to soak up money with the helicopter dlc but personally i dont mind they do need money for a new engine which im sure they will try to make when your roleplaying speeding from the popos in yer trusty hatchback yeling cya m8 then when you come back around you wheels get popped and your car just stops you just go like  oh my god d run it has a very very big and challenging campaign depending on the difficulty your playing at personally im finding the campaign to be alot of fun and the battles on altis life rpg the battles just ok ok ok this game has so much content cons  old bohemia engine  helicopter dlc was said to be free but then when it came out _  yeaa i cant think of much else 1010 100100 10001000 21381927312371273897310

this game features a lot more than it may seem its got lots of gamemodes and different experiences even if you do play the same gamemode over and over everytime you play will be a different experience may it be your role the difficulty or the ai its all different every time you can find a lot of funny moments where the game will glitch out on you a bit but its not really gamebreaking its just a moment you can laugh about plus the amount of customization in the game is unbelievable theres so much different changes you can do to the game from changing your characters voice or face up to making a whole addon and even more im not gonna say the games completely perfect though the main problem may be the community but from time to time youll not meet with that problem some people will be nice to you and help you if youre a newbie to the game and some will just go hard on you and troll you but those guys are rare as people dont appreciate them on the servers the gameplay now that is one hard question to answer the gameplay mostly matters about you and the gamemode how you want to play will still be valid but you are restricted to thinking a lot about your actions or youll get shot by some guy from 800 meters while hes only using a simple rifle with no scope as you would guess another problem is the ai sometimes it may act rediculous and sometimes its just the best ai you can find in a game now im not gonna go over the gamemodes here as its better to find out yourselves but ill just say that king of the hill wastelandmostly fun with friends and zeusyoull be most likely to spend days on this one are the ones i recommend the community the community has an endless array of addons you could use to change your game andor experience im not gonna say much about it except this but theres alot you can say about the community the engine this game requires a beefy pccurrently at its state but the engine is brilliant it can run alot of data without having to give you frame drops or hard cpu usage the engine is mostly dependant rather more on the ram than the cpu i recommend atleast 612 ram for this game if youre gonna play it alot overall the games worth a shot for people who like to plan their moves and think about what they do it before they do it altough you will find mostly funny moments and nonserious moments in multiplayer but less than serious moments that are mostly enjoyable certain people refer to this as a walking simulator but the point is that arma iii is mainly focused on infantry and combined arms you will find yourself walking and running alot to objectives but thats how it is in real life too the game is focused on reality and will be a hard challenge for people who arent used to this type of gaming you can find alot to do in this like commanding ai andor players which is always hard at the start and participating in large assaults on towns such as kavala in my opinion arma iii is worth a shot

possibly one of the best military simulator games ive played with many features to add a lot of realism as well as its endless ingame editor to make your own scenarios over 800 hours ive played is saying something lol and additionally with the help of the amazing modding community the game can be easily adapted to anything from spec ops to city life

i was talking to a guy in a courtyard and a tank out of nowhere squished him so i stole his gear then a guy came over a started shouting ahahahahahhahahahhhhhhhhhahahah with unusual music in the background while placing a satchel charge on the floor nearby and set it to 1 second he then said fly me too the moon ive always wondered if he fulfilled his dream of space flight
recommended
its a great game if you can overlook the bugs and the desync i would recomend hopping into a atlis life server then go and make some in game money and make some new friends and have fun its a really realistic game but ill have to give it 82710 only because its buggy  but if you overlook the bugs its 97510 on my books

yo g its just like cod but with vehicles so best evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah but on a serious note it takes a pretty decent pc to run and its really fun if you play with friends

were to even start with this game to be honest its beond fantastic it has fast become my faverout shooting  war sim ever worth every penny so much to do  and once you get over the slight learning curve it opens up even more  1010 fantastic game buy it
recommended
nice game
recommended
a tactical sim that only has aspects of a game arma iii is not intended to be a game it does not have the action most are used to from todays millitary shooter genre what it does have it has in spades a deep simulation environment that spans accross some of the largest landscape to be placed in a title thus far a plethora of weapons and set ups allow for equipping the perfect blend of survival and attack the ability for user made content to be easily added to the base of the files adds for creativity and fun arma iii is a title that asks you to make your own fun it will not be for everyone and even those who may enjoy camping out with a sniper rifle for hours on end may find it dry and cumbersome however if you are looking for one of the more realistic takes on millitary shooters arma iii will have what you are looking for even if it doesnt it gives you the tools to make it
recommended
as an operation flashpoint arma 1 and arma 2 veteran and having played arma 3 for 200 hours i can safely say that arma 3 is the best arma yet it improves drastically on many of the previous games flaws as well as adding some cool new things and i will admit while there could be many more missions weapons and vehicles in the game theres a lot less to do than in arma 2 it makes up for it by having steam workshop support as well as being extensively moddable for me the campaign so far is the best campaign out of every arma game sure its no where near aaa standards but it has more than kept my interest for far longer than arma 2arma 1s campaigns so all in all i would definitely reccomend arma 3 to anyone who likes tactical shootersstrategy and military simulation games

this game is the reason my girlfriend of four years and i broke up i do not regret a thing

this game lets you have the freedom and creativity to makeplay the battles your way this is not for the casual gamer nor the gamer who gets easily frustrated  most likely caused by the ais complete stupidity and the terrible damage models however this game is stunning the lighting shadows and texture quality really push any pc to the limit i could go on about the bad points but its the good aspects of this game which really sets it apart from the rest if i had to give it a score out of ten  810

if you love arma 1 or any of its numerous iterations  spin offs andor if you love arma 2 do not purchase arma 3 it is a cash grab from the ground up i have no idea what happened to bohemia in the timespan between arma 2 and 3 but i suspect the immense wealth and popularity they gained from dayz really got to their heads featuring 90% less content than any previous iteration bohemia wants to give you the privelege of recreating  porting all the necessary content im talking very basic things here like planes vehicles weapons things bohemia legitimately removed in 3 from the previous games while offering you quality priced dlc like go karts if that kinda gimmicky dlc isnt your cup of tea dont worry bohemia has you covered upcoming dlc totes core improvements to the gameplay mechanics for things like bullet physics so you can pay for your patches now god bless bohemia

this game is great compared to arma 2 its less clunky and the ui is easier to use the inventory system is more effective and simple if you have ever played arma 2 then you know the classic missions everyone played domination wasteland and taki life domination has gave way to invade but its still the same wasteland hasnt changed and taki life is now altis life the game itself gives more potential to build upon or come up with better missions if you arent happy with the current missions do it yourself or wait a bit if you are unfamiliar with arma then understand this the game isnt for everyone this isnt cod bf or planetside 2 you arent going to be constantly stimulated with guns blazing and explosions but every mode when you die punishes you whether it is travel time or losing your hard work dying is not something viewed lightly which forces people to act smart and fast overall if you are into these style of games pick it up it will be worth it

after trying for about 5 hours in vain to just get past a small phase in a mission in the game i can finally say i gave up above the insanely hardcore combat system i got killed countless times by mines that i cant understand how to tell their location so its just a simple annoying random death also the game has a lot of bugs mainly graphic id say the devs rushed too much 510 game health 310 gameplay 810 graphics 3010 gameplay forgiveness bought the game when it was 50% off and i regret spending every and each $ for this game which i just cant play

ja i am happy i didnt buy it when it was new  aming is unrealistic and the grappic style is just hurting my eyes my grappic cart is a 2gb nivida 730 gt it is also very slow with the opjectives when you complete a task you have to wait almost a minute bevore they give the next one

i didnt dislike this game is disliked how they jus ban me for no reason since i never hacked nor cheated  this game is perfect but i dont recommend it since they decide to ban me for no reason

ran into my identical twin on the life mod he proceeded to eventually have the people of altis believe i was an evil twin and had me run out of town via torches and pitchforks 1010
recommended
a clogy first person shooter with a counterintuitive user interface and a tutorial far from helpful there is a reason there is not much enthusiasm for this game simply look at the reviews on any gaming website that is anything moree than an advertisement machine to confirm
not recommended
one of the worst game ive ever played i had great hopes for it but the graphisms are horrible the gameplay is really bad and the difficulty is so high that even the first missions are hard definitely not recommanded
not recommended
i have has this game a day and already my licence expired

military simulations 4162013 arma 3 is till in alpha stage not beta but this isnt the arcade style that most of you kids play by those major company names like ea battlefield series is actually made by dice in europe and infinity ward call of duty this is suppose to be a simulation in a way not just walking around and running on the ground but flying crafts and driving vehicles trying to give you that real enviornment feeling that comes down to a simulation game not arcade of counter strike fps type
recommended
is there any reason why everyone keeps killing me on recruit difficulty
not recommended
nobody bother purchasing this you think you are going to get a call of duty multiplayer atmosphere dont believe it it is absolutely dead with no actually modes it is all running around it is not even a sandbox it is complete trash do not waste your money like i did
not recommended
spent 2 hours setting the keys well now i cant refund it

i really recommend this game the game itself is a very tactical war simulation but not only that you can play with thousands of mods for that game and missions etc graphic  very nice graphics  one year old graphics but are still as good as new games gameplay  simple steerings  easy driving and flying  sometimes unreal physics flipping cars sadly nonot much weigth physics in carstruckschoppers and planes  you can do almost everything eg wasteland braking point altis life king of the hill battle royale and many more but all in all i can highly recommend this game me and my friends had and have a lot of fun with this game
recommended
welcome to arma 3 you play as an american peace keeper with nato who has has gone through such intense training that he lacks the ability to run 5 metres without dying of what seems to be an asthma attack in this game you will be expected to kill people 500 metres away with a machine gun whilst smashing your forehead of its scope this is a coincidence as thats exactly what i was doing with my keyboard 5 minutes after starting the third mission due to losing my sanity prepare for the worst spent 15 hours of your life running across its terrible and repetetive terrain whilst being exploded into 5 million pieces by land mines that are impossible to see go ahead spend 40 pounds of your money to be dissapointed with the worst story i have ever seen in any game made in the history of pc good look you will need it 700010

this game was good but developers lost their minds and game is downgrading they dont make additional things that ppl ask for still no working bipods no fastroping builded in the helis half of the vehicles are mix of everything from every nation available in the game there was plenty of a time to release really stabilized version but still every patch just  ups everything right now optimalization is below a$$
not recommended
tried it for the free weekend 1 hour to down load 15 min of playing and uninstalling from what i could see the graphics looked really nice across my triple setup and 5760x1080 was natievly supported so that is good too bad i had to uninstall it so fast and couldnt see more i hate being told on free weekend after i bothered downloading that you cant finish the game you need to buy it i wish they would tell me that first i could not zoom on the the equipped 10x zoom scope just fired blind at the 400m target in training until i hit it xbox 360 controller use could be better the language was terrible after the last fbomb which was still in just the training part i had enough and am uninstalling i know i have it before well that just adds to the realism that is how people talk well i am people and i was also in the military and that is not how i talk if you cant find more creative ways to expresive yourself than constantly using expletives it just shows your lack of maturity and brains this may very well be the best military game you play and you love it dearly but it is deinately not for me

this will probably be the only arma review i will ever write considering my opinion on these games remains largely the same across all iterations bohemia interactive relies on their   licking modding community to make these games playable everything in this game feels lazy unpolished and mexican made the servers lag all over the place and the playerbase consist of 12 year old children and autistic 400 pound mouth breathing neckbeards this game is a dontgiveyourmoneytoincompitentlazydevelopers out of 10

not recommended
one of the worst games ever the idea is kinda neat but the result  i hate the game the way it is the controls are overly complicated it literally uses all of the keyboard  this is ridiculous this is an fast pace action driven game you cant make something that uses so many keys without coursing trouble the game is hardly any optimized  i would allow this performance for a ea alpha game at best i have barely 30 frames  second when i turn everything down to oblivion  but my computer is totally idle when i crank everything up to maximum i only have 1015 frames but my computer is still bored then i only have peeks in my graphic card of 30% and 70% on my cpu cores the average however is 25% gpu and 50% cpu and i do have loooooots of empty ram even with all tricks in the forum applied which shouldnt be that case that you have to there is hardly any performance upgrade i do not have any sound either this is not my systems nor my fault but the games which refuses to output any the people can hear me though  which reminds me that the pushtotalk key gets notoriously stuck i have to press it several times to make it work and also several times to make it stop even though there is not pattern in it in occasions it works on first press or even like intended but this is rare this game is so bug ridden i cant even access the key binding settings  the game just freezes and the crash messages appears behind the game  so i have to randomly click on the middle of the screen for some time to find the close button which finally closes the game this game isnt ea or wasnt released just yesterday those problems and bugs should be gone by now but they arent so if you want to buy the game  dont do it  you will regret it

not recommended
not for me i regretfully spent $60 on this game because i like the dayz mod i know some people will say its a simulator but at the same time its a game and its not fun at all you randomly spawn always in a town by your lonesome you trek lightyears ahead to find any action or objective thats randomly changing but the moment you step out of your vehicle you get sniped from an army of dudes in the mountains rinse and repeat im normally a multiplayer first kind of guy but the campaignbootcamp is entertaining the game is also an insane rig to run without any framerate i shouldnt need to watch youtube videos to learn how to make the game run decent
not recommended
this is what gta v multiplayer should have been like  its a ing awesome game
recommended
nice game but waste of money disappointed
not recommended
its a fun experince but it should be bit cheaper
recommended
absolutly briliant lots of diversity with a big moding community one of the few modern fps games that focuses on tactics and teamwork as well as player moddifications and not dlc and profit by far the all around best game i have played extremly satisfying when you succeed with something you plan out with your friends
recommended
this game is awesome 
recommended
4th milsim game from bohemia this is by far the best one the campaign isntt currently released but you can still get many hours of fun in the mission editor 
recommended
an awesome and probably the best military simulation thanks to the very easy to use mission editor a huge community and the integrated steam workshop there is a multitude of extra scenarios and mods available arma3 has plenty in store for you and will be around for another couple of years as was arma2
recommended
arma 3 holds alot of potential but lacks alot in its stability the game has alot of holes and bugs in it that lead to some game play that can leave you disappointed and upset their is the terrible dsync game physics and overall hacking issues as well as a few other issues that really can change the battles in the game beside all the negatives the game holds alot of promise as well and on a good day when arma is running fine its just loads of fun it has a whole new feel of play style than any other game and with all the mods available theres no end to different types of game play king of the hill wasteland battle royale breaking point altis life and many other play styles i persoanlly like the game tons and even more with friends and if your looking for a different type of shooter one with open world exploration and survival arma 3 is the game for you
recommended
best game ever for the best experience play multiplayer 1010  m8
recommended
typical arma game  great potential and terrible execution the ai is either comically bad or super godlike with laser bullets squadmates dont do what you order them to they have a mind of their own and its quite pathetic random acts in the campaign make me shake with rage  i decided that i was not having fun playing this game and uninstalled its unfortunate because there is so much potential there but its held back by terrible ai questionable physics and horrendous mission designs in the single player campaigns
not recommended
ok ive been playing arma since ofp and even though i have played only 3 hours it sucks all the guys that love the arma feel and look throw it all away cause this is one big clust f the visuals are way too much and i feel that they over shot what they were going for dont get me wrong its a cool looky looky but hells no not going to recommend this game to anyone
not recommended
a fantastic military sandbox with many addons & mods to experiment with it has its fair share of cons and pros the cons laying mostly with the multiplayer aspect of the game if you intend to buy this game i recommend upgrading your cpu as well as your gpu pc specs if yours dont already meet recommended specs while singleplayer is a graphical  and is fantastic to play on maxed out settings multiplayer youll find it the complete opposite multiplayer i found is managable only if you can deal with the fact that you may have to play on low graphical settings as a cpu intensive game for multiplayer youll have to deal with lower fps and graphical settings if you intend to play on bigger servers on smaller servers higher fps is attainable as well as higher graphics if you can deal with this con that arma3 bears in its mutiplayer system then your time & money will be well spent on this game away from the cons and on to the pros this game is the best military sandbox out there with arma3s many details and functions you can find yourself commanding a squadron of jetfighters or leading a squad to capture a control point the scenarios are limitless with arma3s steam workshop integration all in all id give this game a 910
recommended
when you play multiplayer most people do no get over 60 frames per second 2040 fps is average i would suggest googling average fps arma 3 etc my pc easily meets the recommended game settings but after doing alot of research it seems like the game is not optimized and people are happy playing a game with low fps i play alot of first person shooter and fps makes a big difference so be carefull buying this game as i regret it
not recommended
im loving it and the mods make this game incredibly addicting and also gives it more replay value than any other game best game for multiplay on the pc in my opinion
recommended
my rig could barely hold 20fps so i ran around in wasteland shot some people drove a guys car full of stuff off a cliff 1010 would run around again
recommended
if your computer can run it buy it its a great game
recommended
this game is a really fun game it could use improvements like a better modding community but other than that everything about it is great it takes a toll on your computer if you dont have a good one but still i heavily recommend it
recommended
favorite game i play this nonstop good work bohemia
recommended
sadly i have to not recomend this one so i got this game expecting hours of fun screwing around on servers which didnt disapoint however that being said it lacked in many areas for one the graphics had much to be desired and animations clipped horrificly no to mention the complexity of the controls its not a bad game but the graphics and such need to catch up to the content
not recommended
arma 3 the only military fps you need along with arma 2 lots of mods via steam work shop and a ever vast developement team updating and improving it with games like altis life which you can be a criminal or cop depending on what server ride go karts dlc needed lots to do
recommended
this game is awesome  gameplay is so good play tactical 
recommended
this game is like my life its long boring nothing ever happens but i still for some reason cant end it
recommended
drastically wicked grapics and gameplay very teamwork is required in this game which is in my point of view is advanture while i like the way of communication but this game worth is just 4043 dollars not 60 $ because its too much for this game
recommended
this is the best arma game by far the altis life servers are amazing
recommended
so good never gonna be better buy it
recommended
amazing game 1010 very realistic stunning graphics and amazing gameplay from playing a mod to koth
recommended
so realistic i got ptsd
recommended
i think the game is alot of fun couse of there being so many mods and that makes it a large amount of different styles of the game and that makes the game worth buying in my opinion there just comes out more and more type of mods for the game some of them are good and some of them are not as good the mods i like the most is the rplife mods the game looks good in my opnion and its worth buying if u like a game were there is alot of different things to do in it
recommended
decent graphics just need to improve ai and vehicle collision damage
recommended
a more clumsy game is going to hard to find

after a hundred hours of gametime i still discover more feutures truly an amazing game not recomended for immature people because you will be hated on if you sound like a kid it will take alot of time for your squad mates to trust you
recommended
as i love to see games that have the great feeling of realism this game brings me the most joy it has some great weapon physics hitboxes ragdoll and all the other types of mechanics the mods to arma 3 are great like altis life breaking point battle royale and others like i said this game is really nice if you like simulators of this kind and if you dont go back to call of duty  <3 sadguy

can you do more free wekends of free weeks please i love this game but dont have that much money to get it so could you do some more free wekends or weeks i really enjoyed them and may consider buying it one day

the developers have an iq 100 but it takes 2 not to make such an amazing game guards play this game immediately or feel my wrath if grodd played this you always will guards i do not require your immediate assisstance with this game
recommended
good game read my review on arma 2 oa for pretty much what you need to know game is roughly the same in my opinion
recommended
i have only played this game when it was avaliable for a free weekend and i enjoyed it very much it is alot more optimised than arma 2 it runs better and looks better than arma 2 while also having the essential stuff that a fps needs
recommended
a very very good dude shooter with things that only can happen in arma 1110 its kind of the bomb
recommended
great shooter simulator singleplayer might be boring for some people but the online experience with a great community will give you a great time
recommended
bring your friends and take down these bandits coop in core of its meaning
recommended
if youre reading this review and not playing arma 3 youve made a very serious mistake
recommended
they should lower the price but everything else is fine like the gameplay and the animations
recommended
my opinion about this game is that its bugged and people just camp worse than the camping in cod and bf i truly regret buying this game and i only bought it cause my friends say its great rubbish this game is no where near worth $60
not recommended
great military sim this does not play out like a runandgun game like bf4 this is a tactical shooter and you have to take movement slow and methodical ai is extremely efficient at killing you so you cant go in gunsblazing it has about 5 different character classes to choose from as well as rarely used vehicles each class has their own abilites and weaponry i would not recommend this game to anyone except those who have a high end cpu and video card because this games graphics and netcode are very poorly optimized causing even the best computers to run at low fps i have an i74790k overclock 44ghz cpu 16 gig ram and gtx780s in sli and i get from 3050 fps in multiplayer most ppl get below 30
recommended
probably the best game for serious players who can work together to accomplish the mission
recommended
this game is one of the best games i have ever played to the mp to sp to the editor this game is awesome not to metoin its beutiful scenery ive put 170 hours to this game and im not planning to stop

less dangerous than the army but youre still subject to ptsd
recommended
yea if you are a guy who plays call of duty or some games then this game is not for you becuse it is tacktickal and you die wery fast but when you learn the controls and the game then it fun and i recomend it for the person who can toloreit death and to colect your stuff and check out my channel pls httpswwwyoutubecomchannelucfswlnvhcnqmoiddmvdk4hw
recommended
i bought this game and even till now i dont know how to use it idk wut i will do in multiplayer idk how to put things in inventory and how to respawn in a server last time i joined a server it was horriable it says you are dead wait a medic or wait to respawn  then i waited and waited 15 min nothhing happens wtf  why dont hey put a simple game that you can understand like bf4 cod ghosts or gta 5 
not recommended
a very good and realistic game not for players who just like to shoot alot and kill the most people this is for people who think strategic and have te patience to wait if necesairy keep up th good work bohemia
recommended
so i built my pc specifically to play dayz and such games then arma 3 was released and i shyd away from the zombie series and into full on warfare instead after coming from the cod franchise and the battlefield games i was scepticle that i could be any good playing warfare on such a massive scale let alone on pc i got cracking and found that this game was actually very very well built the graphics are smooth and crisp depending on your setup the gameplay is solid and immrsive and you quickly get sucked in to the firefights and stuff campaign i found was a little left out it felt like the game was centred as much around the multiplayer aspect as possible i was used to that from playing cod overall its an awesome game would recommend just for the multiplayer part
recommended
the latest and greatest addition to the arma franchise this game is the best tactically paced game on the market you could play vanilla and screw around with friends or you could go for a fully modded experience you have many options you could run a massive drug cartel in arma iii life shoot your way to the top in battle royale fight dinosaurs in the new jurassic park mod or witness the end of the world in many ways from overpoch to epoch to doomsday find your gamemode and your sure to have a good time

this is an amazing game in my opinion the graphics are better in arma 2 both are great non the less its wonderful its fully moddable and good multiplayer and singleplayer its a simulator more than it is a game which makes it even better

8 outta 8 m8 would not recommend h8

a graphical step up from arma ii but lacking in content such as weapons and vehicles more of which i hope to see in the future altis is an amazing map and arma 3 provides an amazing experience
recommended
things game is amazing the mod community is great the custom missions are easy to make and fun to play the campaign was very fun and took me about 4 days to complete multiplayer is fun with tons of server running custom gamemodes

good game but you need a beefy cpu and gpu to run this game even a single amd r9 290 cant even get decent framerate need to have slixfire to get good fps game is poorly optimised for the pc as well other then that game is fun and filled with content

so awesomereommend to buy

the focal point of arma 3 is the infantryman you get the feeling that you are a cog in a massive military machine armor rolls in behind you to support the assault helicopters scream by with cannon blazing to keep the enemys head down it is a game about visibility finding your target and fixing them in place while teammates move in for the kill you will spend as much time looking at a map as you will firing at enemies you can barely see but arma 3 goes a step farther and allows for you to take every role on the battlefield you can be the tanker on the front line the helicopter pilot ferrying ammunition and men or the mortar team dropping rounds on a target from a kilometer away you can even be the commander and lead the assault via radio turning the entire game into an rts it scales incredibly well and has an ai capable of filling every role it wants to tell a futuristic story set in the 2030s where arab countries leapfrog the west technologically its a daring choice nato infantry resemble todays special operators like the seals or army rangers against the lizardlike helmets integrated binocular headsup displays and futuristic ammunition of the arab csat faction western forces look decidedly oldschool its an interesting role reversal but without a plot arma 3s daring bits of speculative futurism are reduced to mere graphical pastiche as it has been released without a singleplayer campaign its just a collection of vehicles and weapons when playing nato you dont feel overmatched and when playing csat you dont feel superior youre just there next to the gaping hole where the campaign should have been bohemia interactive has placed a set of showcase missions these are largely the same missions that were available during the beta phase and the alpha phase some of these missions feel like vertical slices that could have been presented to the press at conventions years ago the showcase missions serve a function in showing off the games tech at least i was impressed by the lighting and particle effects pleased to find that ground vehicles handled better than in past versions and that the ai for allies and enemies has been beefed up my roughly 2 yearold gaming pc ran arma 3 successfully at very high settings though not always at desirable framerates my puny mind however with its limited processing capacity was not able to divine how to fly attack helicopters without multiple trips to bohemia interactives forums and out to youtube for several fanmade tutorials thats because the game that bohemia interactive is selling right now does nothing to effectively teach you how to play it help screens flash up during showcase missions so quickly that theyre nearly useless theres an ingame instruction manual of sorts but it feels unfinished some of the commands  switching optics on the tanks periscope for example  are listed as undefined it was on me to go deep into the menu systems and assign a key to make them work these showcase missions move unrelenting fast at times the allied ai makes few attempts to let you catch up when you fall behind and that leads to a vicious cycle of learning by dying this made the glitches all the more frustrating small hiccups saw allied soldiers sucked inside rocks or enemy ai who would lay on the ground as if to sun themselves while i carefully zeroed my rifle and walked rounds in on their head what i would call large errors ranged from the improbable landing a jet upside down on a mountainside to the incomprehensible a lowspeed collision of two tanks which catapulted them both 30 feet into the air to the downright creepy a seated infantryman lengthening his neck by a foot t1000 style joining public multiplayer servers was a crapshoot and there are no bohemia interactive servers to play on the majority of my pickup games were hosted peertopeer players looking for regular stable experiences on hardware capable of hosting more than a few dozen players without serious performance issues are left on their own to roam the wilds of the internet searching for clans but the searching was worth it because when i found a good server the experience was incredible most of those experiences came from fanmade modifications like wasteland and domination  not from anything that bohemia interactive shipped with the game its as if the games community has ignored the content that bohemia interactive made out of spite where arma 3 shines is when you have 6 or more players working with you in a multiplayer session a setpiece cooperative mission called escape from stratis stands out here a nato platoon of 10 is stranded somewhere on the massive handmade map the goal is to find a boat or a helicopter and escape alive the few times ive been able to play it with a complement of 810 friends have been nothing short of incredible simply making it safely from one hilltop to the next has been exhilarating how i know the game is succeeding is that it is teaching us how to operate as a cohesive fighting unit by forcing us to survive in a hostile environment once while moving over open ground our platoon was pinned down by multiple enemy infantry formations we formed a perimeter called out coordinates and together returned fire and destroyed the enemies allowing us to move to better cover while we were looting the corpses for ammunition an armored personnel carrier apc crested a hill we hunkered down and gave covering fire while two players carefully brought antitank rounds to bear then we repaired the apc ourselves and drove off into the sunset

one of the best games ive played
recommended
this is the best military simulator and there is so much content for the game you could play a new thing every day for the rest of your life it just all around an amazing game
recommended
this game is sexual but you need a $10000 computer to run it at 30fps
recommended
i cant say enough good things about arma 3 this is a game for someone who wants a truly lifelike military sandbox this is not cod or bf for the most part run and gun tactics will only get you shot and killed here you will have to think quickly and thoroughly to plan your assaults escapes etc you will die a lot initially until you learn how to properly strategize and utilize the assets at your disposal but you will have fun doing it the bohemia content is a blast to play and replay but where this game really shines is in the wealth of community created content that offers something for everyone the level editor makes it easy to create your own scenarios and tailor missions to your specific desires and play styles truth be told i would pay the $6000usd for this game just to play the breaking point mod think dayz using arma3 enginemaps but either way the game was well worth the money
recommended
very good game i recommend to buy and play this game its fun in single and also in multiplayer but make sure youre rig can run it smooth
recommended
it is the best military combat simulator i never played  buy it try it 
recommended
most realistic military sim until arma 4 come out
recommended
love this game 1110
recommended
i want to recommend and enjoy this game but i dont because it is very buggy and feels poorly scripted sometimes something as fundamental as interacting with the world car doors ammo crates etc can be really awkward this can abruptly lead to your untimely poorly justified demise or if youre really unlucky youll lay around unconcious for 5 minutes prior to dying  i cant forgive the devs or the bugs in this game like a lot of people can it has been this way since arma 1  which i never played but understood it was unplayable arma 2 which i did play and found unplayable after two games i find arma 3 to be barely playable i figure by now they ought to know what they are doing and how to achieve a desired result niche game im sure theres a reason so many people love it i honestly feel as though im not patient enough to both play a simulator game and babysit the flaws of said game in order to get something out of it i havent exactly got a hardon for military games like others do either so bare in mind that your phallus may differ i would definitely change my review to recommend and play this game if it were just less buggy more playable it really doesnt matter if you add gokarts or dragons at this point just improve the game

this game looks absolutely beautifuland run really good on my computer

this is the best version of arma series many new modules are very useful for mission editing

10010 a game were anything is possiable mods were you can see the fish you want to catch  run drugs and sell tortise meat this game is the only fps were maps overlooking the world are usefull and radios are a nessecity  a great fps if you just want to have array of activities that dont invole you killing or shooting others like mining or picking peaches

oh arma the series you love to hate and hate to love lets get this straight this game is capable of epic feats and then a few sceonds later it goes full  i mean gilbert grapelevel  after being a 90s steven seagal movie awesome i will highlight important issues lets go through the bad first bad the engine is outdated people have tried to argue this but it is objectively old its okay to admit someday youd think theyd update it maybe they will but who knows with software these days lets hope so honestly it can be entertaining to watch assualt rifles level large trees flatten brick walls and send characters ragdolling it is however a bit absurd its not really into utilizing multicore processors so you better have some single core horsepower it seems to like i5 and i7 best the single player is goofy here operation flashpoint was epic and had that awesome dlc that was like 1984s red dawn that ing ruled majorly that really isnt here and the team ai is atrocious maybe its been fixed in the last few months but i have seen csat tanks go new jersey turnpike on my team only to have the at guy yell yolo and fire an rpg into it at range of 25ft you must get a good routermodem for this game i can not stress this enough i used the standard twc modem until it blew up and then i was issued some ubee garbage which would lose my connection period the first twcissued modem ran every other game i have ever played fine and arma3 okay i bought a midlevel netgear setup out of annoyance and guess what dcs dropped to almost nothing and frame stay kind of consistent this is a major help if you like this game it may seem obvious to some but most are not used to catering a single piece of software good arma is unique despite its quirks its still the same old oddball coolashell simulator you can mod to hellandback from 14 years ago it just has a vibe to it its justcool this game is basically for multiplayer and mods this is a game for people who want to really and i mean really want to get into an indepth life and death simulation i have played all of those other fps games and here it has no equal it is intense people literally lose it in this game in reality is it based off of vbs and is supposed to test reallife scenarios pvp action can get nuts especially in the woods and in citiesit goes total rambo battlefield codlittle kid nonsense this will get your blood pumping the modsoh man this game is the epitome king of the hill wasteland breaking point epoch armacity liferealism unitscoop it just grows you get it all for free people even have youtube careers based on this game well the family of games how nuts is that conclusion its pretty usable now bugs arent epidemic as they were and the community is more important then even the devs in terms of content growth imo thats kind of interesting its generally a more stable community than most and even cheating and hacking as of this writing seems less than it was a year ago its definitely worth going down the rabbit hole of arma
recommended
arma 3 is like arma 2 except throw in tons of new features and new things to bring to the table it is still a simulator however it has improved from its standpoint with arma 2 unlike arma 2 with it making it big with dayz arma 3 is huge around king of the hill and battle royale this game is very enjoyable especially when you have friend fighting on the battle ground with you i do recommend this game to everyone who wants to purchase it
recommended
good my friend plays it too much 1110  ign
recommended
i now spend 90% of my time on this game help me its too good play with a communtiy id reccomend reality gaming
recommended
i know most people say this is for only really hardcore gamers and while that may be im not the most hardcore gamer but ive had loads of fun playing altis life and several of the other game modes like battle royale 810 would reccomend to most people but the game is pretty unoptimised atleast in multiplayer
recommended
if you love hardcore military simulations that require you to have octopus hands to play them go ahead and buy this no really its great
recommended
arma 3 takes the simualtion to the next level optimisation and stability has dramtically improved since arma ii and the modding community keeps the game forever fresh and renewed
recommended
its amaze just hardware hungry
recommended
for me it feels that its really hard to get into the game first of all for the menu screen with all those settings and  u need a menulicense and without a helping hand to get you into some action u will just run around ingame or drive quad tho if u got someone to help u out this game can be really fun and has alot of content to offer
recommended
buy this game and you will never regret
recommended
loads of different game modes to enjoy with friends
recommended
fun with epoch 
recommended
landing speed was to high got me killed 1110
recommended
very fun to play whit friends and whitout friends still fun its good grapichs but if you have an  pc dont get it its some really fun mods and so many mods you can play so it never gets boring
recommended
i`ve been playing this game for over a month and i`m pleased with itif you want to buy it i strongly encourage you to buy it if you have a friends that bought the gamethis game is made for multiplayeryou can play the campaign and workshop missionsi`ve been playing 3 modesaltis lifewastleland and battle royali enjoy them and i don`t get bored by themi play with my friends with amplifies the experience pros a alot of mods to choose from enjoyable if you have friends you don`t get bored easily consyou need a good pc to run this game on 3060 fps i don`t really liek the singleplayer missionspersonal opinnion it`s kinda expensive
recommended
tldr very good game get it if its not already in your library if it is in your library get it for a friend this game is a very solid entry in the arma franchise it improves upon arma 2 in every way besides content but that is even made up for in mods if youve played arma 2 and enjoyed it then youll love this if you havent played any army before youll still love this it is a must buy but ill explain why that is my review pros this game has very good graphics and well optimised i would go as far to say this is the most realistic combat game out there there is loads of content in the steam workshop for many hours of fun and tons of mods and game modes the pvp is simply the best pvp in any game ive ever played and ive played a lot of games compared to the last arma it improves in all areas besides content ill cover that in the cons there is very few squeakers and trollers and it has a mature player base new inventory system is very well done the sound in this game is amazing cons it will absolutely  your pc you need a good graphics card to run this game it runs like a champ if you have a good card lack of weapons and vehicles but it makes up for it by having a great attatchment system this is not for impatient people nearly every mission will have you walk at least 1km i dont find this a con but i imagine most fps players would final rating would be 910 simply because it requires a very good rig to run it well
recommended
the best shooter out there if you ask me once you play this all other shooters will look pathetic
recommended
the story for arma 3 is great the voice acting is a mediocore but entertaing the multi player side is fun as well battle royale is great way to burn some time for sure the domi and patrol ops servers are entertaing as well if you can find a group of folks that using comms and teamwork
recommended
this is by far the best war gamesim i have ever playedrp there are so many addons and things too great job
recommended
i really want a demo version
recommended
even battleroyale and overpoch are totally worth the money and theres a lot more behind
recommended
this game is great its loads of fun playing rp and doing domination i recommend everybody buys this game
recommended
good game but you need a top pc for it
recommended
cool 
recommended
great fpssimulator not for cod style fans pros very immersive gfx with the modsgame types it always keeps the game fresh bullet physics are accurate excluding windage cons sometimes depending on the servermod you can have a very buggy gui overall this game is awesome if you like a more strategical fps though it allows you to use 3rd person due to the multitude of servers that run different game types you will find it hard to put this game down if you like to rp then there is altis life which allows you to take up an persona and do task associated with a job that you choose these types of servers are policed by a selected police force if you are after some team work you can either choose a coop mission which allows players to take on objectives enforced by a very intelligent ai this being said there are servers that offer a pvp experience whether you want an objective base like king of the hill or deathmatch style this game has what most gamers that enjoy fpss and even those who may not
recommended
yes totally reccomending this game the campaign may suck but the online love the vitual reality with customizable charcters with 1000s of combinations and a great selection of guns what i didnt like desync in online desync is where a character glitches or objects in game causes lag usually items disappear or you will die great mechanics if you really want a simulator military this is the best youll find nothing better then what you see here pros virtual arsenal training grounds great mechanics cons desync minor lag by far one of the best fps games ever cod is stupid now you will never go back
recommended
great game but only really buy to play with friends
recommended
best military simulation out there huge modding community wit hthat comes lots of content the multiplayer is very bugged because the performance depends on the server you play
recommended
just buy it allready
recommended
if you are into a more indepth type of shooter  with several community made modsadditions to improve upon the game and add to it  i highly recommend this game the controls can be a little tough to get used to at first and the maps are quite large but a lot of fun can be had especially with friends
recommended
i personaly think this is a great game becuse it has a nice engien a lot of gamemodes and mods and an active dev team but its not perfect becuse it has some glitches and bugs here and there but otherwise good game 910
recommended
it is alright
recommended
arma 3 is a very fun game to play whether you like the editor or just the multiplayer you can find your self playing hundreds of hours playing the game it also has mods that are a ton of fun such as battle royale arma 3 epoch and many others
recommended
better than dayz standalone
recommended
buy this game now
recommended
simply amazing fun to play insurgency and king of the hill
recommended
arma 3 is very glitched ad horribly unoptimized and yet is still an amazing game so i will rate it a 4 and reccomend it
recommended
so once youve figured out what the  youre doing youll like this game if not then go play some call of duty
recommended
reminds me a lot of dayz it doesnt have any zombies and it isnt as pick up and play as day z either 1010ign
