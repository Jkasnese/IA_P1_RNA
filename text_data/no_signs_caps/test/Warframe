its been almost two years since i first played warframe andi thought id update my review considering how much the game has changed mostly for the better the core philosophy of being a magic space ninja and juggling melee attacks ranged combat and special abilities still makes up the core of the game while none of these aspects are particularly brilliant on their own combined they greate some seriously entertaining emergent gameplay switching between these forms of combat adds in a lot of variety and helps keep things fresh even hundreds of hours in game more advanced players can perform manuvers like zorencoptering while sprinting jump then crouch and use a melee attack to gain extra mobility the games arsenal has also become much more interesting as digital extremes has rounded out the arsenal by continously adding in exotic weapons we have unique guns including a tentacle shotguna freeze raya flak cannon a wristmounted laser beam and more messing around with all of the weapons and discovering which ones you enjoy playing with is always fun the game now has over 20 different warframes classes allowing you to play pretty much any role you want from a melee berserker to a stealthy assassin thanks to some great visual design pretty much all of the warframes are fun to play as and discovering which one suits your playstyle best is a great experience <3 rhino the overall aesthetic of the game is quite striking as well all of the frames have their own unique visual flair the paladin oberon has a long slender body with very natural deerlike look combined with some nice japanese and scifi flair even 500 hours in the game is still incredible to look at the soundtrack and audio design are great especially if youre into pewpew scifi sound effects although many of the abilities sound quite powerful that being said you will probably want to play your own music after a couple of dozen hours into the game since the soundtrack does tend to repeat itself now lets talk about one of the games biggest strengths and weaknesses the grind like diablo or destiny warframe is a game all about grind you grind resources to craft weapons grind resources to level up mods grind planets to obtain frameweapon drops etc for the most part the grind is reasonable and rather enjoyable due to the strength of the games combat even hundreds of hours into the game i still had a blast zipping around the maps and picking off enemies with my insanely specced out weapons and warframes however at times the grind can be overwhelming as you try to unlock that one specific part that you need to complete a warframe or a gun only to get something completely useless instead also ranking up level 10 mods can be an extreme chore to this day i do not have any rank 10 mods on me that being said the grind never feels too overwhelming like in other f2p games ive played before and paying to circumvent the grind really isnt necessary in warframe another one of my complaints concerns the massive power creep in warframe since de churns out so much content in such a quick amount of time many of the warframes weapons will be either extremely weak or extremely powerful to the point where several hotfixes are needed to get them to a decent shape assuming they are patched for example sniper rifles are worse than bows in most cases shotguns suffer from heavy damage falloff and long reloads and frames that dont offer utility such as crowd control healing buffs etc and focus on dealing raw ability damage suffer greatly the game definitely needs a large balance patch to work out these issues my third complaint is that warframe doesnt seem to be going towards one direction de is focused so much on adding new content haphazardly that its difficult to see where the game is going to this day there is no campaign only a handful of small quests there is no real endgame as it mostly consists of endless mission types i have to wonder if were ever going to get more meaningful content as the current mission types feel all the same kill a bunch of enemies but with specific conditions such as capturing a target rescuing a hostage etc plus mission objectives rarely vary so if youve played one extermination mission youve played them all and the same with the other mission types finally the game does an awful job of explaining itself even with the new tutorial the game does not explain all of its mechanics properly and throws new players into the open with little advice consulting the games wiki or recruitingregion chat will make the experience for new players a much more enjoyable one so despite all of my complaining i enjoy warframe quite a bit at the end of the day its a fun game that has a great variety in content and allows players to pretty much choose how they play and set their own pace its a very fair f2p game so theres little reason to not give it a shot tldr  good aesthetic  fun combat  weapon and class diversity  mostly fun grinding  very generous f2p model  grind can be overwhelming at times  power creep  lack of story content and end game  mission types feel very similar  poorly explains itself

to anyone who has played mass effect 3s multiplayer mode in the past  i have to say this is what i wish mass effects multiplayer mode wouldve been like in mass effect you had your specific races in waframe you kinda play as one race the whole time but each tenno has their own specific abilities and perks to help you get the edge over countless enemies thrown at you and really helps make you feel like a total badass you can even further enhance your warframes with the mods that are dropped from enemies as you complete missions from planettoplanet these mods can help with consuming less energy so you can use powers helluva lot more frequently or make the effects last longer more powerful and add so many ways to change your preffered playstyles offering so much replayability especially with friends remember all those times when you werent able to jump in mass effect and instead only givng the option to jump down a certain ledge while getting chased by hordes of banshees phantoms & collectors well in warframe you can go all parkour wall running across huge gaps to evade enemy fire wall jumping to reach highersecret rooms the amount of places to use parkour is astounding if you use your imagination and experiment i could go on & on about the added features and content theyve added over the course of its life which is still considered in beta by the way but overall i think this was the game ive been longing for and i really enjoyed my time with the me3s multiplayer experience myself which definitely left me feeling hungy for a more enjoyable coop game like warframe has provided for me did i forget to mention this thing is freetoplay give it a spin and you might just find yourself spending too much of your time in this game xd

lets go ahead and describe warframes plot in the most simplest form youre a ninja in space ok reviews over go home wait youre still reading this alright fine lets keep it going frames at war is a thirdperson action shooter space ninja simulator where you and up to three other players test your mettle against three woefully unprepared factions the space merchants heavy metal russians and the zerg you battle through waves upon waves of commuters on their way to workhome to provide forsee their families and sliceblastshoot them to little pieces in your magical supermanwoman body suit with your crazy monofilamentvibrobladeanthrax dispensers which you can purchase blueprints for or you can find parts in goldfingers space palaces to create blinged out versions of them speaking of blinged out things this game is free to play but actually done well you can almost get anything in this game without spending any money at all and not feel jaded at the massive time youve wasted doing so that is until you want to feel special and buy a buttload of cosmetics at that point you can either blow money on platinum or have some other dumb sucker do the same to buy junk from you in the trade channel what i take away from the whole experience is that youre a monster who hurts people for fun and profit i really like this game

its a 3rd person actionshooter with a fair emphasis on the grind a lot of ppl will be put off by the rng nature of some of the items that you have to farm but at the same time if you go into this with a few friends the game can be extremely fun keep in mind im also a huge fan of monster hunter so my opinion is a tad bias in that regards the cash shop isnt game breaking and it gives ppl without a lot of time on their hands a chance to keep up with those that play this game too much all in all if you enjoy 3rd person action games i would recommend that you look into this one just keep in mind that to get to a lot of the end game stuff youre either going to pay for it or invest a fair amt of time into it

i can highly recommend this game to people who like third person shooters it is a freerun very good movement to get quickly around the maps cop ninja space hackn slash shooter it has many different areas and in each area it generates a new order of chambers to make the completion run slightly different every time also its free to play so why wouldnt you try it out the pvp isnt really great but it is mostly a cop pve game anyway this game is much about farming resources and bleuprints for new equipment weapons and suitscharacters there is a trading system in game to make getting the prime bleu prints easier you can ofcourse spend money on additional stuff it isnt a pay to win game that isnt necesarry to do so by using trading you can get even those items anyway but itll take way longer ofc i played this game for more then 1120 hours and i never spend any real money on it if you become really good in playing and speeding trough missions it can become kind of a bore and annoyance to drag noob players across the map if i play a non t4 mission with players that are not on my friend list 99% of the games i play will result in me having done more 90% of all damage and me waiting at a door that needs 2 players to open also there is not really much of an end game and if you want to play this game for melee mostly then dont its a shooter at the point of writing this review melee is obsolete even for characters that are based around melee conlusion its good and free by far my most played game on steam

i figured i ought to review this dynasty space ninjas of hellgate london its pretty good for what you get at any rate ive spent about twenty dollars into this game by now and i can honestly say i dont feel like its been wasted time its a pretty grand game all things considered its simple easy to get into and the controls dont usually make me feel like a blind man groping for spilled change at any rate its grindy boring at times but its worth the occasional jump into for a purely cooperative experience dont you miss that when games were purely coop or had a coop focus i miss that what a shame

warframes concept when presented to the normal person would seem unusual or unappealing this can be forgiven since the concept is space ninjas on a solar mission of fighting giant brutes and strange merchantmen whilst holding back the invading forces of a mysterious infestation yet this game has proven to be hundreds of hours of fun for myself and my friends who would play it the ability to go through a procedurally generated map while shooting grineer platoons in a defense or slashing apart an infested swarm in a survival mission has produced unlimited amounts of fun the game gives the player an ultimate suit of armor which grants them unimaginable power as they run jump slide kick shoot grapple punch stab and slash at enemies who give the player an actual challenge the content is even more extrordinary as it is updated very often and is largely influenced by the community thus every player has a direct voice in what they want the developers to put in next thus for a game overflowing with action adventure community and a sheer uniqueness not commonly found in the typical selection of modern games warframe should definitely be on the consumers list did i also mention that it is free
recommended
really good game worth the time for the beginners i enjoyed this game for around three weeks before getting bored of it
recommended
i have well over 700 hours of gameplay and rising this game is very fun and can be very addicting it has its ups and downs but first ill go over the ups an obvious up is that its free to play so you can try it out and if it doesnt fit youre gaming style then just uninstall with it being free to play theres obviously going to be microtransactions but let me asure you that there is nothing in warframe you cant get including nearlly all cosmetics even if you dont put a dime into the game i havnt payed any money at all and i have some of the best gear and a hand full of the cosmetic items this is due to the fact you can trade in game items for microtransaction currency for warframe its called platnium as far as game graphics they are amazing not far cry 4 graphics but definitely one of the best free to play game graphics iv seen dont let that discourage you if you dont have a high end gaming computer the game is suprising very optimized and the devs work to improve it even more the gunplay is as great with a third person run and gun parkour style aside from guns there are also tons of melee weapons that are just as strong not just a last resort if you run out of ammo the depth of melee combat is amazing collect different melee stances as you progress to match youre play style perform combos with the different stances to cut down youre enemies and one of the best things about warframe is the devs the devs are super active and constantly pumping out content as well as streaming on a weekly bases their passion for the game is like none other ok so the bad things about warframe repetition this has been a problem for the game for quite some time and the devs are doing alot to fix this after playing for as long as someone like me or even far less warframe will feel like a chore this can obviously be prevented by playing with freinds or doing unconventional mission play styles but can still get kind of dull this is something the devs are taking alot more seriously and they have talked about various ways to improve this i personally think that the devs can acomplish something to ease or fix this the second thing bad about warframe is timed events so what i mean by this is events that offer special prizes like guns melee weapons or mods mods are items that you put into youre character to give them better stats or abilites each mod has a unique buff will only come once and if not will come much later in the year meaning if there is a gun melee or mod that you really want but wasnt there during the event you cant get it unless its tradable in which case you can trade for with other players over all i love this game and i love the devs they work hard to deliver a great game and it is definitely one of my favorite free to plays if youre still sceptical then just give it a try and see for yourself

do you like a light stealth element and awesome grouping capabilities do you enjoy assassinating your target and vanishing without a trace do you revel in using awesome built in stealth routes and abilities then watch as this game gives you all of those things and your teammates throw it away to instead die multiple times and warn the entire galaxy youre going to kill a boss 1010 would play again

ever play global agenda its similar but a lot better the graphics are incredible the adventure is unspeakable most importantly youre a ninja fighting in space and planets with pets bows guns pistols and most imporantly melee weapons i love the glaive for example i feel like captain america throwing his glaive at an enemy and exploding it killing multiple enemys then grabbing my glaive back to throw again it comes with stance mods and these stance mods let me do different combos with the melee weapons warframe uses a mod system that lets you customize your warframe and weapons in unique and different way that help you against different factions the game has lisets player ships which you can walk around in setup your arsenal before navigating to a planet to fight some grineer or corpus did i mention you can fight in space now i think i did anyway my and my buddy kubrow a cute feriocious beat that you have to take care of explore planets all aroudn the galaxy and i most of the time just sit back while jubu my awesome kubrow rips off grineer heads and limbs and tosses them aside hes very nice if you get know him now lets move on to my favortie part of the game the dojo the clan i have my own dojo 100 rooms i kinda maxed out i cant build any more rooms haha filled with labs which let you make custom weapons you cant get from anywhere else i have dueling rooms which lets me and my clan members duel each other i have my main room which we spawn in and an observatory attached to it i occasionally do my homework while sitting there and looking at the beautiful galaxy there are spots you can meditate on in the observatory room i believe theyre even gonna bring a shooting range eventually for dojos so you can test out your weapons and see which one you like the most i think ive talked enough time to play warframe and join my clan 1916 rangers i hope you found this review helpful i love this game and i would love it if you joined and played it with me cheers

pro  two primary weapons  you could unleash fiery maelstroms turn invisible create a decoy use teleportation to switch places with an enemy or manipulate your foes to fight against their allies  you can run warframe missions with up to three other players  the inventory management includes tools for crafting items out of materials that can be bought or dropped during gameplay  social  character models and animations are very impressive  progresses through the solar system  great audio feedback  free to play  update after update  over 100 achievements contra  space ninja suit  repetitive maps and missions conclusion understandably its important to provide motivation to keep running the levels but the fun of loot drop systems comes from finding something new and shiny that makes your avatar look cool instead warframe gives you another crafting component
recommended
this game is so awesome it gave me 3 erections in a row the gameplay is awesome the graphics of wich i care less than a  are good this game is one of my top 3
recommended
all you need to know about this game is that the combat is amazing there are a few glitches overall but the fluidity of the combat is something to behold this is really the reason to play this game the leveling system and ability to modify and customize your weaponry and warframes is also quite addictive id also mention that playing with two person teams is ideal for most missions and more fun generally playing with four people turns into complete chaos and at least imo makes the game much less fun the main gripe against this game is that its repetitive and the grind for certains modspartsetc can be kind of daunting and boring after the shock and amazement of the combat wears off will take a long time you realize you arent really accomplishing much  just like other mmos outside of wow which does a good job of constantly giving you a new story to unfold the issue could be resolved with more oddball events maybe even massive invasion missions with thousands to slaughter etc i find that the game shines the brightest when you face wave after wave of enemy that you can cut up into tiny pieces or as an ember ignite the world on fire and melt their faces its really satisfying trust me but when you get stuck doing really drawn out missions like mobile defense the game gets kind of tedious i also find that while most of the warframes are incredibly fun to play  they are not well balanced like nova for example is way too powerful and frames like frost zephyr or excalibur are not really effective fun but not effective for moving along in the game often if playing with friends one or two people will kill like 70% of the stuff and run around doing so while the two others will spend time collecting loot and hoping they arent shot in the face by heavy grineer infected or corpus units with all of that said i do recommend the game because its a lot of fun to build new weaponsframesresearch abilities and get out there and kick some butt just beware of the horrible team gameplay due to imbalance and the repetitive nature of the missions perhaps in the future they will create missions that require more cohesive gameplay but until then just have fun slicing things into tiny bloody bits or shooting holes through their torsos with shotguns because it will make you grineer to ear done intentionally also i should mention that this game is not p2w at all but it doesnt hurt to buy some platinum from time to time if you want to proceed faster than the game otherwise allows clearly the system is rigged in favor of profits but if you know that going in youll be better able to handle it

okay where to start to all the people looking at my hours yeah i know i played this game on the website client alot more before steam onto a dead honest review i have been playing this game from before open beta almost a year and a half and i have seen all of its ups and downs this will be honest back in the day you would start off with a choice of 3 warframes either excalibur mr coverboy volt an electric wizard or loki the trickster who loves being invisible back at this time the game was simple you shoot stuff you get xp and mods and you get better right well now there are 20 warframes or so i think and their prime versions superpowered versions certain things avalible in the game back then are not avalible now such as the snipetron sniper rifle and excalibur prime shiny coverboy these items are now no longer avalible ever great news huh there are too many weapons to count and i own almost every one and have playtested every one i own every warframe class except one i could harp for days but lets move to the present classes nonlinear you can play any warframe with a sniper rifle each warframe has its own unique abilities with some warframes more suited to tasks than others modability meaning you can build your warframe for anything you want even if it is not reccomended customisation meaning you can recolor your warframe to your own wants even if its pink very few different skins color packs are pay to play different skins and helmets are pay to play there is an unobtainable warframe excalibur prime weapons tons of choices legitly a thousand plus different combinations there is a tentacle gun different classes of weapons shotguns pistols sniper rifles melee frikin bows customisable yeah pink guns mofo modability modding your guns for different stuffs yeah most model designs look amazing very few guns have altfire some guns are unavaible to obtain like ever snipetron ect companions puppies fuggin puppies compainions such as little robots or mutants djinn to follow you around and shoot stuff very few varients 4 dog classes and 7 companions most are useless in combat unless putting work into it not including dogs dog companions take an amazing ammout of time and effort to obtain controls fluent non choppy controls combo keys for different reactions ingame ie wallrunsliding melee attack no input lag even for lowerend computers you press w and you walk forward god darn it easy to get used to control setup is slightly unorthodox level design each level is randomly generated from a selection and tileset of rooms each type of faction has its own level designs no level is the same unless you have played like 10000 levels like i have and you got one damn one that was the same the tileset of rooms gets repetive some areas bug out the map graphics ambient atmosphere when needed physics can be hilarious i have 10 hrs of playtime just pinning people to the wall enemy design is intresting especially the zombies weapon design is amazing low end computers will have to down the graphics alot economy this is where a checklist is redundant as i may have to rant i will start out by saying that this game is completely free to play and any item in the game is obtainable by putting work into it including the pay to pay items this will hold true throughout my rant although i will probably complain alot in essence this game is run by crafting you craft weapons warframes companions ect there are three kinds of people who play warframe there are the legit f2p players who get everything legitly and obtaining p2p items through trading the second kind of people myself included are the people who have put money into it but not extravagant ammounts usually $10 to around a top of $300 this goes out to you tf2 people and then finally the walletwarriors yes you you know who you are you are those people who have put insane ammounts of money into this game in order to have everything you want then and now i have a friend who has put well over $100000 usd into this game those are the different types of warframe players as stated before this game can be completely f2p but as in almost every f2p spending money makes things faster and gives you an unfair edge for example a f2p gets 30 spaces on a maxed out weapon while a p2p can purchase an item that gives them 60 spaces on the exact same weapon this item can be obtained through trading but can be time consuming there is one thing that all players do and that is grind hollllllyyyy  78 of your hours on this game will be just repeating the same damn mission over and over to get materials yeah grinding other space missions yeah your in space your base is in a spaceship the staff of the game are very understanding and focus more on community wants first than their own wants frickin space ninjas d overall yes this is an amazing game overall the only fallout point is that after playing for a long time it gets very very boring for me i only play this anymore when im asked to by a friend or if a new major update comes out volt prime plz <3 this game is amazing and i still enjoy it but not as much as i used to due to overplaying 1010 ps if any reader has questions feel free to add me i love a good discussion

the game has a steep learning curve if you have played other tps it will be easier to understand it took me a while to get acquainted with it and often i still learn as new things are introduced but with the variety of frames characters with all their own abilities there is a lot to discover craft mod battle pets as kubrows doglike companion pets drones like the sentinel deathcube and they are all with their own mods and customizations frames are divided in the regular frames and the prime frames the differences arent that big mostly estetic with a big bling factor and some extra modded slots this also applies to some weapons from giant mallets to throwing stars and double swords and many  many other weapons to try out to increase your mastery rank mastery rank is your level levelling up your weapons and frames doing missions defeating bosses discovering new planets will earn you experience towards your masterry rank ones your xp bar is full you will able to take a test to advance to the next rank note here that failing a test will put it on a long cooldown and you will be able to take another try the next day so be prepared because some tests will be tricky the key in this game is having patience patience is a golden virtue in gaming especially in this title the game uses an optional payment system almost all weaponry and warframes can be earned in game everything other than founderexclusive items and event retired or prime items however with platinum the grind to obtain weapon and warframe blueprints and their resources is circumvented a player can purchase weaponry from the market for credits although some weapons and all warframes require the schematic to be purchased and then crafted  you can virtually buy everything with platinum i personally advice to starting in an existing clan there are many with a lot of options also starting a clan may appear easy but there is a lot of time to be put into creating a good big working and active clan big investments are made to make those big dojos your clanhouse to a beatiful place to learn new things and its also home for your trades trades can only be done in dojos there is a big community that is willing to answer your questions in the right channels i say the right channel because if you are on the wrong channel doing your thing you get banned from chat there are gms around most of the time that keep an eye on things the people behind the game are very active in bringing hotfixes that often end in another fix to fix the hotfix but things get fixed in the end there is a good vibe and sometimes a joke is made from de events are made to offer players some festival fun and items like bunny ears event color pallets moustache and more also every day you get a login reward that can be a discount xp weapons prints and more free to play at its finest worth playing

extremely fair business model  if you pay in when you have 75% discount  countless hours of grind and repetitive mission but man its fun and cool  go read about the viable modsweaponswarframe and buy plats to trade for those things would save you lots and lots of hours into the game i really recommend you to pay i mean seriously with 50$ i was able to geared up 5 warframes to the max on two accounts  ps i was playing the game as a 2 player coop with my girlfriend who also enjoy the game immensely d ps2 this is the real game with really balanced sex representative and absolutely no sexism overtone no battle bikinis no muscle bulk than question if you even lift every time you look at your character they got different body shapes for each of the warframe take nova for an example thats as realistic and close at it gets to real world body shape cons quite steep learning curve and the depth of character customisation which is paramount in this game  my girlfriend and i wasted 24hours of game time spread over many days getting stuck in many missions _ before we knew that the mods that really matter to the game are serration and elemental damage

 first dont look on my steam hours i downloaded warframe to steam just now i have about 585 hours on the ingame profile warframe is free to play game still in beta but already a decent game that worth a try plot  there is still many question marks not all of the lore revealed so i will tell some of the known story  you are a tenno twisted race who can control a warframe a special suit that gains special powers to the wearer you was awakend from cyro sleep by the lotus we dont know much about her yet she guides you and help you you was awakend in a time of chaos the grineer a cloned race is taking over the system you have to stop them more is explained through the tutorial mission alot of this game is about fun while some players grinding the mastery ranks  a level in typical mmo  i found myself not doing this at all  compare my 580 hours to rank 11 some are already at 16 on this time  this game have large varity of weapons and warframes im taking the weapons that im enjoying to play and playing with them there are alot of unique weapons into this game and there are typical rifles and pistols this game is tps  third person shooter  but combine some ninja elements  wallrunning sneaking even tho it still need rework and as well melee weapons  there are dozens of melee weapons in this game  and that whats make it unique when comparing to other games also about p2p  trading system never paid a single cent now i got 10 warframes all with reactors and dozens of weapon slots just get stuff in void and trade for other players platinum so you want to enjoy find things that fit your playstyle  and there is a huge varity of weapons from lightning gun to rocket launcher from dagger to jet powered hammer  download this game and start to enjoy

ive been playing since update 10 and warframe is nothing short of amazing warframe has evolved from your ordinary somewhat storydriven third person shooter to one of the best f2p games and can possibly rival most games you buy the tenno descendants of an ancient warrior civilization awake from a long slumber to find themselves at war with a horde of cloned humans a protocorporation of humans known for their robot proxies the infested victims of the technocyte plague and the corrupted guardians of the void and only seen in the void warframe is the name of the suit that the tenno wear each suit bears 4 special powers that can change the battlefield in different ways varying from powers that make you invisible for a limited amount of time to stomping the ground with great force tumbling enemies into stasis warframe has a large variety of exotic weapons goofy but exotic designs the maps you consider classic for me the corpus ship and the grineer asteroid can get tiring and repetitive to suppress the repetition updates are released or you make your own fun even though warframe is in beta and still has a few bugs crawling around the system i still consider this as a complete game adding new features like most game developers do when releasing sequels i highly recommend you to download this game and explore the bizarre worlds that warframe has to offer

man compared to a while ago this game grew with leaps and bounds id also recommend prepare to grind as a subtitle

there is one arguement that will be put up to this game pay2win i will say right now that it is not while there are microntransactions everything that contributes to actual gameplay can be acquired through playing the game there is grind in this game putting that out there now because there are people who absolutely despise it i for one do not have a problem with it to be perfectly honest there is alot of grind the good thing is that the gameplay is just so much fun that it is actually enjoyable to play missions and its not just dull shooting ground after dull shooting ground looking at you call of duty one kinda big problem i have with it is the inventory to get more inventory slots you have to pay with platinum the microtransaction currency this causes problems with having weapons and warframes that you like and not having enough room to store them the trading system slightly fixes that problem with being able to trade players for weapon parts mods and warframe parts as well as platinum if you are playing the game and find a really valuable mod you can go to the trading tab and trade with players for it by putting up offers and looking if anyone wants something you might have in summary this is a slightly flawed but really enjoyable game if you dont mind grind and some waiting for things to happen to be honest what game isnt somewhat flawed
recommended
its a great game i have to say the atmosphere reminds me of mass effect and the multiplayer of mass effect 3 with grindfest its a hack and slash third person shooter game that its polished and responsive fast paced combat strong tactical elements and good graphics to be perfectly honest this game is really quite addicting that you have to grind items mods etc the best part is that once you reach higher levels this is the part where you do cooperation and strategy to execute the plan the developers are actively adding content to the game which is quite awesome make sure you play this game with your friends since players in the public game are always racing to the extraction point which includes leaving teammates behind doesnt communicate and so on graphics are great and the level of combat is sweet downside is that there is still few bugs left in this game so expect that to happened game is also f2p you can get most of the items in this game by just getting blueprints and so on i recommended this game especially if youre playing with your friends rated 1010
recommended
i find warframe very fun and even though you can buy weapons and tennos with the use of real cash you can still play the game using default weapons but i hate the limit of colours for customizing your character past that i do find the game very enjoyable and if your pc can handle high graphical settings then switch it to high its a beautiful looking game
recommended
i love this game it is the one that i keep going back too however i recently went back and looked at the new user experience it was not as joyous as i remembered the steps taken to introduce you with the tutorials were better than when i joined but still i understand why so many people feel it is just too bewildering hopefully with the new user experience finally getting some major tlc this is going to make the whole process much more intuitive the most striking thing to me was how little damage the initial set of weapons do and how few useful mods drop early on i got through the opening missions on mercury with others my experience on these levels aided that but the step up to venus was horrendous the osprey shields made trying to kill anything a chore i was forced to go back and repeatedly run missions to rank up the mods i had managed to collect however once you break through and get to earth this is when the game truly shines better mods drop which made the whole game seem more palatable the graceful movement within game is beautiful the addition of melee 20 has added a whole new dimension to the game making melee both viable and more importantly fun it is worth the effort to perservere and to get fully acquainted with the mechanics of the game it opens up a world of possibilities the continual development is widening the scope of gameplay with each update definitely recommend accruing major game time

good grimy game great for grindy players also good with friends  make a clan settle down and destroy all the grineercorpusinfestedcorrupted 910 will kill again

absolutely fantastic the game plays smoothly and the combat dynamics are flawless the customisation options which i should note are practically limitless give you a really personal feel your avatar is well you this game is free and though i dont really want any of the dlc im gonna get one anyway just to support the devs simply because such a brilliant games deserves to have some coin thrown at it this games a real hidden gem
recommended
best third person shooter i have ever played great free to play game

this game got a jet powered hammer that can literally send a heavily armored enemy so far away that you lost track of it while laughing like an idiot 1010
recommended
for a free to play game this game is absolutely worth it the graphics are amazing the gameplay is superb and it is downright fun to play there are some downsides though for one you really are gonna have to spend alot of time grinding for new frames etc trust me when i mean alot i mean alot if you are gonna download this game you are gonna have to dedicate some of your time into this still for a free to play game its absolutely superb ]
recommended
warframe is a great cooperative game with many gamemodes difficulties customization warframes and weapons it doesnt bore me at all however it is very grindy and repetitive and so it may bore some players cough casuals cough overall the game looks great runs smoothly and is a ton of fun get it its free

this is now my life

about 90% of my playtime is probably just me walking around in my ship and nothing else 1010
recommended
ninjas in space 1010 download now
recommended
warframe  ninjas play for free especially since update 13 press x to ninja you might not like the game but thats just because you dont like 3rd person ninjas melee combat magics and scifi if you didnt quit for that reason play again or come back every update to see whats brought to the game
recommended
warframe a really great third person shooter game developers are always providing with new content and regular updates the community of this game can be said to be very large compared to other free to play games that are availabe through steam can be enjpyed solo but of course playing with friends and messing around is always a lot of fun this is not a pay to win kinda free to play game purcahsable currency is an option everything in the game is obtainable by all players with the in game currency however grinding would be a thing in the game if you enjoy a hack and slash game this would be one of it
recommended
yes i do own warframe and i am ashamed to admit it
recommended
it may have repitive gameplay elements its still fun to play especially with friends it may have pay to win elements but you can still be the very best with out paying though it may take longer overall its a game to give it a try if you got no other mmo shooter to play another thing you are a ninja 1010

warframe gets mixed opinions the most common thing is its too grindy while yes sometimes the grind is real it is not all bad in warframe everything is unlocked the only thing keeping you back is your mastery level which is basically a level on your profile that gives you access to higher weapons you gain this by using more variety using and leveling the different weapons and frames that are availible to maximum and leveling up after all you can get every resource in the game for free every resource needed is in the game you just have to play through some missions and find it there are only a couple items you dont find but with the active development team of digital extremes de they livestream and host a developer stream where they showcase up and coming features and after these they put up a mission to where you can get one for free fancy all in all the game runs well looks amazing the gameplay is fun super responsive not too difficult to understand the only con i have about this game is that there are no cosmetic choices for free players really but you do get all the game for free gameplay and value wise and the fact that some of the tutorials for inner sections of the game are a bit underdetailed and somewhat confusing other than that i say you pick up the game and see how you like it in the words of a favorite youtuber of mine if youre even somewhat interested in warframe go check it out  its ffreewhaddya got to lose
recommended
this game is addicting and the des are always coming out with new content frames maps weapons etc and they actually listen to their playersalso its free to play not pay to win like some free games

oh you wanted a regular mmo fps no sorry you came to the wrong place this isnt a regular mmo let us say you have absolutely no character costumisation no not the traditional kind like hairstyle and other boring  like that no in this game you wear an armor a stymulating armor which you may repaint add things to it take things away from it oh and there isnt only one armor type this game is still in beta so await more armors or let us call it how it is warframes within every new patch oh so its an fps with armor costumization and weapon costumization and ship costumization and skill costumization basically you can costumize the whole ing game how your puny little mind desires four skills per warframe three regulars one ultimate leage of legends ripoff oh bugger off at least this game makes it right and doesnt make you mash buttons like a five yearold it takes skill creativity and planning this game is well i r8 gr8 88 m8 no seriously the game is worth more than a try

this game is better than most of the payed games that have come out over the past 2 years this game is to simply put it fun you will always find yourself coming back to it the graphics are amazing and they are not demanding so people with potatoes like mine can run it and make it look beautiful pros  large variety of weapons  very large variety of mods addictive shooting mechanics  great crafting system  fun  great to play alone or with friends  not p2w at allthis game is the best example of a fair f2p game all weapons that can be bought with special currency can be crafted  can get special currency through in game tradeno need to spend money cons  mechanics can get repetetiveeven then they are still fun  cant think of many other things to put down here tldr this game is fun solid 97510

i really couldnt be any happier with a free to play gamenote this is usually a bad genre full of boring mmos or bad fpss that are full of micro transactionshowever warframe is a different story while it has micro transactions they dont ruin the gameill admit they make it easier but that is boringi like this game alot but i do prefer the ps4 version which really shocked meall in all if you like ninjasspaceparkour and free stuff get this game now
recommended
this is my alltime favorite game it has almost everything i dreamed for in an mmotps definetly recommended
recommended
no pay barriers at all  every single item in the game can be obtained through gameplay this is one of the best and quite possible the best free to play game on steam absolutely excellent great gameplay looks fantastic awesome combat and weapons excellent fx music and sound lots of uber cool characters to choose from how they fitted all this into under 2gb is pretty damn amazing highly recommended and awesome good fun to play with friends solo or online with random squad members why it got a metacritic rate of 67% i just have no idea my favourite game for quite some time
recommended
warframe is a space ninja with guns kind of game overall it has a nice movement and combat system however the grinding can get pretty repetitive the gameplay makes up for it though
recommended
for those of you who remember gunz the duel its a more awesome version of that for those of you who dont its just an awesome game 
recommended
the beauty of this game its free to play no catches no paytowin and its mostly a four player coopthe experience is best optimized to play with friends or meet friendly strangers that become your friend to play with sure there is microtransactionsbut you can get everything in the game viatrading or farming for free the game is coop so no ones experience is ruined during a massive online pvp game by someone else saying wow that is such a op weapon that just killed me for the 40th time i bet you bought that using your moms credit card the game is beautiful with tons of planets to explore and complete with friends various weapon options to quench your thirst of variety and upgrades ive only bought $5 worth of microtransactions due to a 50% off coupon ive recieved ingame and i wanted to support the game and keep in mind i was already 270 hours into the game already ive traded my way to get platinum from farming items  the microtransaction currency   9510 would reccomend because of the vast community and lovely freetoplay
recommended
though i now play on ps4 i cannot recommend this game enough
recommended
truly brilliant game the graphics and the feel to it is amazing a good multiplayer campaign and excellent gameplay but of course the best part is its free
recommended
takes some investment to get into it but when you do the ride never ends great game
recommended
this game is somewhat interesting to recommend for a few reasons but first the positives the game itself is fun and is also an interesting consept for a f2p game although rather repetitive after a while the combat itself is above average having you equiped with a primary secondary and melee with a large amount of choice for each catagory the movement system is what will be most interesting for new players as i cannot see any reason why doing a wall run gound slaming on a tough enemy then going into a slide and killing another enemy with kunai whist sliding past him wouldnt be entertaining now onto the negative aspect of this game the 10 km high barrier for new players that is drum roll here crafting and farming despite the game puts you in a much better position at the start that it did previously the barrier is still there a lot of the weapons that are good to begin with either require unknown and unobtainable reasources for a new player or be locked away from you untill you build the weapons that may as well require literal unobtainium for a new player however if you can find a group of people to play with you will have a much more enjoyable and easier time playing the crafting also uses a automated this will be finished in sort of system and some of the wait times are somewhat crazy the worst being 3 days for a warframe which needs you to build all 3 of its parts first with a minimum time of 12 hours if all 3 are crafted at once so be prepared to wait and brutaly maim someone with an axe while you wait over all the game does a good job of what it does and that is to provide hours of play time to build and upgrade a set of weapons so they become powerful enough to kill the entire population of a country in a few minuites but remember if you get this game you will learn to farm or get eaten by crazy rabid space dogs your choice really
recommended
pretty fun game to play with friends
recommended
one of the must fair f2p games out there with pve content
recommended
warframe is a game that is free to play but no payment is ever really nessicary ive actually only played the game for 100 hours and im in end game tier equipment the game is always open and though uninteresesting at first once you get some friends to play with and talk to the game is a blast dont get me wrong the game is a blast without your friends but in a coop game friends is always the best way to go the game has missions about 20 per planetmoons there are about 20 of these moons along with random levels called alerts and invaisons there are 6 or 7 mission types the levels are randomly generated but the type will always be the same for the mission you selected ive never seen the same level twice though they will pretty much always have the same aethetic these mission types really make each mission unique extermination is where you need to kill all the enemies in a level defense is like horde mode but youre defending a certain artifact you have the option to extract every 5 waves with loot getting better but enemies getting harder every wave and the potential to lose everything youre already earned moble defense is kind of like defense but rather than wave based its time based with you having to take a core around to different static posts this is the worst type of mission survival is a time based mission where you must survive duh as long as possible the enemy will cut your life support at the start of the mission so you must get life support dropped from lotus extration is where you must mine cyotic a special ore ice thing used to freeze luxury marsian jellyfish i wish i was joking the game is always intense action theres always something to do and thats why its so fun though earth and eventually mercury are kind of boring but once you get out of there the game gets so good its unimagible a great experiance deserved to be played by everyone with frequent patches and constant attention play this game
recommended
while i recommend this game because it is a fun experience i can easily see how the fun factor will die very quickly there are a lot of weapon choices and different classes to play but if you dont know what you already like youll either spend a ton of time or money trying to find out by default you are limited to 2 classes and 8 weapons your starting class will take 1 of these slots you typically have 3 weapons at all times 1 primary 1 sidearm 1 melee weapon during the learning process of what you like you will most probably be deleting several weapons and frames to test out new ones or you can pay for more slots weapons and frames are crafted or bought they also level up leveling up items is how you level up your overall character level that means you must try new weapons and frames in order to advance further i do not recommend spending money on anything that can be obtained by playing the game the purpose of playing is to obtain resources and unlock new areas to obtain more resources if you buy your way to endgame you will not have a reason to play for me i joined with a friend who has some friends that have been playing for some time my sister also joined up what ive noticed is this when i play with the veteran players or with the public there is a heavy rush factor you will feel very underpowered and will not really kill anything its like acceptable leeching when i play with my friends that are just as weak as i am i feel like we can have fun and explore the levels a bit more the game is heavily coop the veterans that i know dont seem to have any trouble soloing some missions but overall the missions are unforgiving you will need to go in with a team lacking a central hub to meet people future content you will have to either have friends that play or join in public games and take your chances recommended but not long term

i was a gamer i started to play warframe i am nolifer now thank you warframe 1110
recommended
1110 a f2p version of destinty which also offers a lot more than destiny
recommended
this is a great game if you have lots of time to put in because it needs lots of time for grinding for weapons and xp to level up

it is a cool game i say like you can kill guys and cool tricks like slide and shoot thats cool

warframe is a free to play online shooter with the theme scifi and is very great to play with friends in if you are willing to pay like in other free to play games you can buy the ingame currency called platinum which can be used for buying things from the ingame shop or trading with other people for rare parts etc this game has got a trade system as mentioned before in which you can trade certain rare parts mods etc for platinum and other goods this is a way you can get platinum aswell by selling the rare items you find in missions like the void for instance this game is free to play like i mentioned before and you are eligable to craft most if not all items in the game after playing for some time this is because you need items to craft items which you can find in missions so you have to do missions to get the crafting requirements there may be some things that i have missed in this review but you at least get the point of the game this game is like mentioned a shooter game which can be played online and solo or just with friends so you will have to love shooter games in order to love this game otherwise it just wont work
recommended
a fun game for those who want to spent some time as a space ninja very energetic and exciting coop multuplayer and some amazing designes on weapons and tenno unfortunately it lost my dedication later on because of the blurred questline
recommended
two words space ninjas in all sincerity though warframe is an excellent title it has great gameplay smooth visuals and works well even on somewhat older computers being a free to play game youd figure there would be pay to win items using microtransactions while microtransactions do play a part in this game it is entirely coop not competetive so you arent going to get wiped on the floor by someone because they shelled out some cash for goodies because they will always be on your team and every equipable item in the marketplace that can be bought with premium cash can be crafted using blueprints which you can buy in the marketplace for ingame credits there are even some items only available through finding the blueprints for them in missions all in all warframe is an amazing coop experience and while the game is technically still in beta and has a few bugs and glitches here and there the developers are always on top of the situation and regularly converse with members on the forums to weed them out i would definitely reccomend a quick download of this game right away after all ninjas play free d
recommended
i highly recommend this game but ofc it has its problems [ to avoid a long wall of text ill just write the pros and cons ] note dont believe those people who say this game is pay to win  this game isnt slots and cosmetics are the only things that you cant farm but can only bought with plat which something that has to be bought for real life currency but as you know you can get plat through the power of trading the devs deserve money though so throw in money if you want to and if you want to buy plat just wait for a 75% discount from login rewards unless youre impatient pros  ninjas in space [ u gotta admit thats friggin cool ]  free to play gets constant updates lots of content rewarding fun and addicting combat lots of variety to weapons and customization not pay to win parkour the really really awesome community clans trading awesome lore its fun lots and lots of enemies good graphics pvp trading companions [ sentinels and kubrows ] challenging [ youll know the feeling ] cons not the best server buggy sometimes complicating and confusing start takes time and determination [ not really that much of a con but its what u must pay ] waiting times for your weapons repetitive missions although it has an awesome lore its confusing sometimes and complicated and most of all unfinished not for the impatient the games detects what you need and pretty much makes things harder for you and will try to throw random useless stuff at you [ jk iz juz rng ] casuals will pull you down badly ok this game is fun okay but its buggy servers will pretty much annoy you and i understand the pain as a first time player because i quitted this game last time but i got back when i understanded it a bit more and put in more effort it became fun and thats when i got hooked into the game yes it has repetitive missions but the combat makes up for that and the variety of weapons you can get but then again it takes time overall this game is better than most f2ps out there and even paid mmo games id rate 85 out of 10 but its server connection problems will annoy you youll feel the full force of this problem when youre doing endless defense mission waves then youre at high waves like 40 and above and all of you get disconnected and you have to fight all of the enemies by yourself

would play again  10

good standing game in comparicing for other games in the same niche looks like devs push their evolution engine pretty good smooth gameplay good matchmaking nice weaponry and deal damage system game become much better over time with new features modes and fixed old ones finally some ai improvement is going on music improvements now is pleased to hear pretty responsible dev team to community okay clan system sadly low level of overall design but have some tact and palette and fx planning pretty influencing fe sometimes you find enemy or ally much faster at radar instead of just looking in front of you in the middle of a battle different diffuse and normal maps resolution in game assets seriously devs havent sense of objects scale few quests poor story grinding feelings some overload cpu performance actually you not feel it ingame but if you monitor your hardware or have any tasks in bg that using cp during game running youll find out some breaking logic elements in crafting and gameplay minor not much gamebreaking bugs some of them you dont even see if youre not so pedantic things like slightly different damage dealt on host and client side of the game even with good network and data bandwidth and so on

great game with a great concept i thought this is another p2w space game but you dont really need to buy stuff with your real money you can sell your in game item to all rich  people and buy an item from poor  people trading is everthing and buy every premium item on game with your own enterprise 910 this game ruin my life

one of the best free games there is many people call it a pay to win game but all that paying really does for you is speed up the process of gaining weapons and warframes great game over all i would give it a 910 simply due to glitches in the beginning of every single update

a third person shooter with overall amazing graphics and a gameplay that doesnt get old if you want action then this is the game for you the fact that warframe is free to play makes it way more awesome than it already is the classes are great and all of them has their own little features and weapons overall i think its a great game but i wouldt recommend it for players under 12 years old well anyhow i will give warframe 710 because of the great gameplay behind it and if you are a fan of third person shooters then youre at the right place i have thought picked up some small glitches here and there thought i dont blame it since every game has it but i would totally recommend this to most gamers out there

warframe is the frequently updated lovingly supported freetoplay outing from digital extremes the team that brought you 2008s mutagenfilled dark sector in fact warframe is the notsodirect sequel to dark sector in that it takes place a good handful of millennia after the conclusion of its predecessor but dont worry about plot because warframes story is thinner than water youre a tenno a humanoid being descended from the protagonist of dark sector revived by the lotus a mysterious entity who seeks to bring balance to the milky way youre sent out to do battle with space marines space zombies and space corporates seriously with your space ninja superpowers provided in part by your warframe a bioorganic suit of armor created by a virus that has begun to infest the entire star system warframe is an oddball of a game to classify its part mmo part monster hunter part mass effect 3 coop part vanquish and then some the game is so hard to describe in fact that ive coined a new genre for it spaceninja simulator okay its a thirdperson action shooter mmo but shut up when you first begin youll be dropped into a tutorial that teaches you simple movement tricks like jogging and sprinting firing your weapons and hacking things apart with your sword immediately following this youre dropped into the general ui and shown a big galaxy map think mass effects galaxy map an inventory screen a foundry where youll craft things a store and some other options here is where warframes biggest folly lies not once are you ever told how these work some of these elements are pretty easy to pick up on click a planet on the map to bring up nodes these represent missions which unlock branching paths when you play them but others are more complicated how do i make weapons how do i get more warframes whats an orokin catalyst and will require alternative methods to learn about and utilize thankfully warframe has a big community so its not hard to pull up a google search and find a halfdozen listings for why excalibur is the best starting frame and why all the gear youre given to start with isnt going to hold up if youve ever played vanquish for any length of time then you already have a fairly good grasp on how warframe works while you wont be slowing time down virtually anything you can pull off in platinum games underrated 2011 shooter can be done here however there isnt a single bit of handholding which as previously mentioned is the biggest issue with the game tricks like sliding on your knees to move rapidly while unloading rounds on your foes running up a wall to reach a better vantage point and zipping through the air with your feet outstretched to kick enemies to the ground are all things you must find out through experimentation or word of mouth while its a cool idea to keep these as things to find out on your own the acrobatics of warframe are a huge portion of what makes it unique theres nothing quite like running along a wall while laying down a hail of gunfire on unfortunately located foes below warframes unique blend of gunplay and melee is an unconventional approach to the shooting genre while melee is almost always an option its rarely given the same level of importance as the firearms you wield not so here  youre actively encouraged to take advantage of the many stunts your melee weapon of choice grants you while straight up punching at the faces of your foes isnt the most viable option leaping into the air and slamming a massive blade into the air to trip over your foes giving some poor sod on the floor a flurry of punches to the face from a pair of gauntlets or bisecting a mob of degenerating clones with an electric whip are just a few of the choices youre given when it comes to hacking enemies apart not all weapons are the same however so while the obex fisticuffs look cool they taze and they punch theyre not going to be nearly as practical as the scindo battleaxe thankfully theres a lot of gear to choose from and the frequency of updates from digital extremes will see to it that you never run out of options warframe i saw this in kill la kill there is no overworld in warframe to speak of the entire game consists of instances organized by nodes on a web map with missions that vary in faction objective potential loot and tile set each faction is a completely different force to compete against as the grineer utilize overwhelming numbers and heavy armor while the corpus defend themselves with shields and robots that act as cannon fodder lastly the infested are a race that does what the name implies over time planets containing nodes that denote specific missions will become infested and you will temporarily ally with that nodes faction to repel the infestation once the infestation meter for that planet is reduced to zero the original faction will move back in and the conflict resumes once again an interesting feature of warframe is the previously mentioned tile set tile sets are different gridbased chunks of a level that are randomly selected before every mission begins to make a completely unique level to explore and do battle in much like timesplitters though youre not the one making the maps the openended nature of tile sets means that you can end up in an expansive or linear map making some missions lengthy and full of loot to find and use for crafting new gear or others short and sweet to make boss runs that much shorter while some may be irked by the idea of layouts not set in stone the idea of never running into the exact same map twice is a refreshing take on the coop shooter weapons can be modded for improved stats and the ability to generate elemental effects like fire ice and even radiation weapons can be modded for improved stats and the ability to generate elements reactions like ice and fire one of warframes biggest draws is the flashy noncompetitive gameplay you can enjoy with friends for the low price of free however the label of free is all too obvious with all weapons warframes and other gear being objects you can purchase right out of the box albeit at inflated prices easily circumvented by farming for the parts needed to make these frames while many items such as the coveted raidexclusive prime equipment require that players achieve them instead of pulling out the wallet the idea of being able to buy the newest gun the moment its released is quite odd however not one item that affects your ability to perform the game is behind a pay wall all noncosmetic items and even then some cosmetics can be obtained with the simple concept of invested time this is where the monster hunter comparisons come into play if you want to get a new latron rifle youll have to purchase the blueprint with credits earned through regular play and construct it in the foundry using materials found during different missions once youve begun construction timers come into play this is another aspect of wareframes freetoplay status if youre patient your new gun will be ready within the next 1224 hours if you want your fancy new rifle now however youll need to drop a small amount of money to rush the build to completion while its not going to impede your ability to participate normally it wouldnt be a surprise if this turned many away from the idea of playing the game however the nature of the game is the grind you can always be better and thus youll almost always be looking for the next big thing to find as there are no real goals set for you outside of big events besides the ones you want to achieve thus you may love warframe or you may actively despise it 810

warframe is a very well made free to play 3rd person pve coop action game set in a futuristic version of our solar system currently in beta and it has been for more than a year but do not let that put you off this game deserves at least a moment of your time you take control of a tenno a member of a mysterious race of long forgotten warriors the name warframe refers to the suits of exoarmour used by the tenno in battle the idea for warframe grew from a 2008 game by digital extremes dark sector the two games share the same universe and there is some evidence to support the theory that dark sectors protagonist is still alive in some form in warframes far future missions in warframe come in several flavours extermination survival defence and boss battles are just a few of the challenges you can expect to face the levels are procedural generated from tile sets so even if the same level is played repeatedly there will be map variations every time although pvp does exist in the game conclave and a duelling room the main focus is pve 4 player squads versus all this grim future has to throw at them there is so much content in this game im only going to scratch the surface customisation is vast and varied with new content added frequently all the standard guns you would expect are here assault rifles pistols shotguns sniper rifles and much more bows bizarre energy weapons flame throwers and a huge amount of melee choices weapons and frames can be modded too need more health and shields no problem apply the mods to your frame and then level them up for more health and shields there are hundreds of mod cards to boost or add stats elemental damage mods can be mixed to create different effects and a refined melee combat system has been added recently there is no shortage of customisation in the looks department either colour palettes alternate helmets badges skins and a tonne of accessories looking good in warframe does come with a real world cost most of the cosmetic upgrades will require you to buy platinum of course warframes are different beyond their appearance each frame has 4 special powers bound to it these range from direct attacks to team heals mind control to invisibility team buffs and enemy debuffs the list goes on and on each warframe has different base stats all frames can run slide jump and wallrun there are plenty of hidden areas and shortcuts that can only be accessed by chaining together jumps and wallruns the graphics look great and really come alive during combat environments range from murky swamps to the divine radiance of the void the soundtrack and sound effects are also of a high standard weapons sound like they look and feel the drum heavy ost helps to keep the action pounding along and that first 10 seconds of music on the login screen will always make me think of the terminator theme another plus for wf character animations are fluid character physics are a bit floaty i have seen the handling of warframes compared to steering a boat but personally ive never had a problem with it and the at times wile e coyote like momentum there are downsides too this game is a time sink and the only way to avoid those long hours spent grinding is your money buy some plat and get that stuff instantly loads of my friends have quit playing when they find out about the 12hr wait on the parts needed to build a new warframe then the 3 day build time on the actual warframe again this has never been a big issue for me i could easily keep going for another 700 words more pros and cons explain more about the game and expand on those points ive mentioned but this is the bottom line warframe is a fantastic game that has done nothing but improve in the time ive played it

yeah its pretty decent kinda hard to get into at first can be a little grindy nothing compared to runescape though very fun with friends my favourite aspect of this game would be the art direction and digital extremes actually listening to their players which makes for a very healthy and friendly community give it a go if you havent already

edited for update reasons alright so i have decided to change my review since i realised that it became very old and people need to know more about this game rather then just knowing that you are a ninja in space alright so lets begin warframe is a free to play game now it does have a secondary currency named platinum which is used to either purchase weapons speed up building processpurchase warframesand cosmetic items now just hold on for a second and listen this game manages to make this currency obatinable using trading and those warframes and weapons that you can purchase using the currency can be obtained without having to use the currency and this is when the foundry which is basically where you craft comes into use now the primary currency is called credits and that currency is used to purchase blueprints for the weapon or the warframe that you wish to have now as you guessed you have to wait now some can argue that this forces you to buy but actually it doesnt it encourages you to level up your stuff and get credits and xp while its done the timing for weapons ranges from 1224 hours while warframes take 3 days  now the trading system is excellent but the trading community are just full of s and s  but its better to join a clan because they can help you in trading alot and now this gets us to the coop part and to me this is the most important part in warframe since first it claims it is a coop game therefore i should judge it based on that and to be honest the coop system is fantastic now that doesnt mean you cant play solo they actually give you the option to play solo but the coop is so nice since the community excluding the trading section is very friendly and you will find tons of people who are willing to assist you and you have to try and socialaize in warframe since having a team of 4 organized people each one knows his role and follows it is better then 65 player clan running and gunning this makes the game perfect for playing with friends but the biggest thing that makes you want to purchase platinum is slots for your frames and weapons now i know this isnt a good thing but comparing to how much they have given us for free its kind of something they require to get their funding and as i said the secondary currency is obttainable in the game cosmetics used to be with platinum only but with the introduction of this new trader who i forgot his name xd you can buy cosmetic stuff for credits and a third currency that is easily obtained in the game now this brings us to the last thing which is color palettes which from my info are only obbtainable using platinum but in alot of occasions developers just hand out free color palettes and the developers are amazing they listen to the community and will never hesitate to put their ideas into prespective and are very active using livestreams and all kinds of communication on the forums nevertheless warframe is one of the greatest f2p titles out there and this review definitley didnt cover even 30% of the game so i really encourage you to try it out and explore it for yourself  1010 would break fingers again

alrighty so where to begin youre a cryogenically frozen and now reawakened space ninja with the ability to manipulate many properties of space and time at will whos supposed goal is to maintain the balance of the solar system which has fallen into chaos the year isnt given but its sometime in the far distant future lets get down to business the game itself is a third person shooter with you having a primary something that generally requires two hands like a rifle or a bow & arrow a secondary onehanded or dual wielded pistols or throwing stars and a melee weapon positives creative variety of playable classes warframes massive variety of weapon types total of three weapon slots primary secondary melee evolving lore the devs are constantly adding in more and more content and as they do so they add in more backstory to the game and its factions variety of mission types exterminate capture survival etc a nice amount of customization primary in coloring is present in the game free to play pay to look good fairly easy to trade with other players to get the realmoney currency negatives massive grindwall its earned the nickname warfarm because of it inverted difficulty curve game starts difficult then gets easier as you get more gear devs are working on correcting this platinum the realmoney currency is required for warframe and weapon slots which new players start out with very few of im thoroughly addicted to this game and ill always come back to it its possible to get all of the ingame currencies for free but ill confess to having $70 spent on my account but these guys work hard they have weekly livestreams to update players on their progress and deserve every penny

this is a f2p third person shooter which has a descent f2p model theres blueprints you can collect which are for free credits and require resources and credits to make which can be rushed for the p2p currency platinum pretty much everything you see in the store yuo can get for free aside from the color packs and a couple other completely cosmetic options through alerts the orokin void clan tech research bosses warframe part blueprints and the market blueprints section

for a free to play this is very good it is good that they offer the ability to make a warframe instead of purchasing it it makes you appreciate what you have in a game 1110

this game i played it when i had no idea what i was doing got frustrated and left for a month or two but then i took some time to think about it and ive played almost every day since that month or two ended the controls are amazingly fluid nothing is more satisfying than dashing through a room full of grineer and slicing them to shreds not only that but all the weapons sentinels and noncosmetic gear is all free and incredibly worthwhile to earn i was the little level 12 loki staring in awe of the rhino prime with a shiny boltor prime and carrier sentinel sucking up all the useful items im currently working on getting loki prime and ive built a sentinel all on my own the grind to get all the rare materials was worth it in the end all in all this is a game to keep an eye on not even out of beta yet and play for a bit who doesnt love space ninjas

this game is just amazing the graphics are amazing and the game mechanics are superb i have been playing for a year and im still hungry for what this game has left to put out

after over 3300h of playing ive finally decided to write review it may be little fanboylike but i play it so long for a reason lets start with developement 2 years ago when ive started playing game was really poor there were twothree rooms connected in different combination to make it look bigger almost the same type of enemies grinding with almost the same weapons all the time but that was two years ago thanks to regullary released updates game is now huge and i really mean it and it just keeps getting bigger and constant updates make you wait impatiently for next ones preventing boredom secondly game is build not only by devs but also by players that have huge impact on digital extremes developers decisions about what to do next its like community is part of the studio third thing nice community ive played a lot of games and this one has really good community compared to other games of course there are some morons that will try to ruin your experience but there always has to be few of them right next thing is huge variety of equipment you play your way theres no such thing as best equipment there there are plenty of choices to match your playstyle lastly its true f2p model there are no things that are neccessary for good equipment that are only availible through real money well slots for your warframes characters and weapons are limited at first but you can always sell few things to players to get enough money platinum to get slots or simply just buy platinum once when youll receive 75% discount its really cheap then and i guarantee you wont regret it otherwise platinum is only needed for cosmetic items the only disadvantage i can think of as veteran warframe player is lack of things that you can do at some point but to reach that point youll have to play for at least few hudred hours so i guess theres not much to worry about to sum up great game great people great developers that care about us players there are bugs but they are getting fixed as fast as possible if you want to know more pm me on steam or ingame where i have the same nickname as here soldier1312

you are space ninjas what more would you want d warframe is an amazing game and i would recommend it but the game can get a bit grindy but if rng is on your side its amazing
recommended
yes this game is totally awesome everything you see in that trailer is what you see ingame minus the big guy  let kril  at the end getting cut in half you cant cut him half ingame but from warframes that are more on the ninjay side can sneak around while other warframes can be powerhouses and have immense crowd control also rhino get him not even trying to hype him up or anything hes the tank of the warframes and can stop time i think thats good enough for anyone anyway as for this game without spoiling anything this game has little to no replayablity de is still working on making the game more balenced with lore and a replay aspect i hope as for the game you are tenno a race of ninjas that offer balence to the solar system as you unlock the solar system nodes you will find harder enemies and it can get really fun at the end however you start out with the worst weapons and it may take quite a long time for you used to the game these weapons do almost nothing to even the weakest enemies and since you are so new you cant just go do one mission and gain credits ingame earned currency to purchase better weapons sadly to say it doesnt stop there good mods modules that can be used to upgrade warframes and weapons may be really and i mean really hard to get so you know what that means you have to farm for them killing the same type of enemy over and over in the hopes that they will drop a mod you must keep this in mind when playing then there is the noreplayabilty aspect many maps repeat themselves and you can see this alot by the time you do get the best weapons you will already played 58 of the maps in the game the 5 maps are grinner ships corpus ships corpus outposts earth and jupiter the other 3 maps are void derelict and the new {to the time of this review} hive missions  because of this most players just give up on this game some parts about the game that are good is that it is free you get top notch quailty gaming bliss for free another good part is a learning company that listens to you de digital extremes is learning how to be a great company and has a staff that loves people that play this game need something from a staff asking does work and finally no one is forcing you to do anything you dont have to farm for the mod you need you dont need to play online you may however get into a clan as soon as possible xd and one more thing before i end this this game is great ok it does have its flaws some things from their star stek game is in here the double door thing is here ai runs in circles sometimes ai is not smart but it is a great game over all even to me if it has lost a little bit of that scifi feel by having bosses speak in english while troops still speak their language in the end just try it out you dont like it dont play it play team fortress 2 instead you like it keep playing you love it get other people to play write reviews be honest and have fun thank you and good nightmorning sexy day

i started playing this game earlier this afternoon its 2 in the morning now i havent taken any breaks i have just now found the will to put this game down for a few hours then wake up and play it more after a 7hour session that has left my neck and left pinky terribly sore my only regret is that i put butter on the poptart i ate when i got up to use the bathroom about 3 hours ago it was awful i couldnt stomach the first bite but yes you should play this game as soon as you do you will not stop doing so except for bathroom breaks but my one word of advice do not put butter on a poptart please despite what peter griffin and glenn quagmire said it is not good

despite peoples claims for it being a pay2win game youd be terribly mistaken all frames are obtainable through regular play you can choose to invest real money if you so wish to get the frames you wish or you may choose to get it as you would with any other game its not a mmo more of a 4player coop third person action game allowing you to take control of a warframe refered too as tenno the race controlling it basically youre a space ninja you get to zip line run along walls back flip walls slash a big  sword and generally kick  there are three factions corpus grineer and infested infested the infested are mostly melee based with strange aliencorrupted creatures that can inflict deadly poisons or maul you to death corpus the corpus are like the evil science type guys these have moa robots practically guns with legs they mostly use lazer weapons not only that there are melee corpus who make use of electric prods nasty as well as the annoying shield spray robots which can repair the shields of foes around it grineer the grineer unlike the corpus have more standard type weapons less futuristic they also have melee uses who try to slice you youll find them doing a lot of damage if they successfully land a hit originally this game had started off as something so very small with only a few frames loki excalibur volt rhino and mag it slowly started growing and becoming so much more really basic levels and basic movement and have strongly benefitted from constant player feedback improving the game with every update the game is extremely responsive however be prepared to get a hand ache after hours of play with how much you need to keep moving to avoid enemies and help allies one minor issue for me is that this game lacks any cover mechanic enemies can cover but you are unable to blocking is in the game but it also feels rather pointless since ive found myself in little to no situations where it was actually neccesary or helpful it is also assigned by default to mouse button 4 if youre old fashioned like me and have a mouse with only 3 buttons you may need to assign it to a spot on your keyboard the game is simple the graphics amazing it works on my really substandard pc with a graphics card as basic as an asus eah6450 with a simple godawful amd athlon 64 processor 3200 199 ghz and 300gb of ram running winxp sp3 yes this pc is about as old as the hills you may not be able to play with friends with a pc like this but you sure as hell can play the game at well over 30fps and as far as im concerned that is absolutely astonishing considering many other games with worse graphics than this run about as fast as a snale on salt do i recommend this game hell yes i would recommend it to everyone even if you wouldnt like it try it anyway since its free to play and you really just cant complain ive had more hours out of this beauty than i have out of any aaa $6000 piece of over hyped trash

the game is terrible here is my reason so im playing tons of missions and after a hard days work im very tired you know with all the wall running and sword fighting etc and i just want to sit down well my ing space ship can travel faster than a space shuttle but atleast a space shuttle has some en seats then if i want to sleep all ive got is my floor which isnt exactly comfortable i deal with alot on a daily basis and they couldnt throw in these basic things yet they give me some  ai called r2weatley9000 who just tries to kill and is annoying id trade it in if i could just for one seat like ill give you this broken ai for a broken trade k the worst problem though is without a doubt the lack of a bathroom ive been using earth as my personal toilet since the  tenno wont give me one ive been forced to they think the grineer have been trying to poison the planet well actually its just my garbage i give this game 5 simcity 2000s out of mlp fim episode 2 season 55 revenge of the muted deaf kids top comments reviewers opinions first  bush wookie 1010 review sir  datguyst34m call of duty brings back the same multiplayer fun also this bush wookie guys review is kinda cool too  ign change log ver 10 given to public ver 11 deleted word would from a sentence ver 12 added a capital letter to the word change in the title of change log cer 13 added in top comments reviewers opinions

it is like riding a lowrider and shooting infidels with your homies try it before devs kill the game for sure

one of the best games ive ever played it flows well the third person camera may be hard for some people to adjust to but this game would be very hard to play in first person while it is a bit tough to get started you gain momentum pretty quickly there is almost always something new to get or unlock this game might sound like it is trying too hard with ninjacyborgsinspace but it makes it good extremely good 1010
recommended
ever feel like being a space ninja well this is basically it ninjas flying through space saving the solar system from the grineer corpus and infested it has boss fights on almost every planet modding systems gives players a chance to mod their weapons and warframe according to their play style vaious mission types that are actually fun to play developer support is great constantly fixing bugs while releasing big updates i love the fact that you can grind for prime items to be sold for platinum which is the ingame currency that is obtained by paying with real money allows people with basically no money to spend a chance to get those items that have to be purchased with platinums speaking of platinums theres many customization syandana capes colour packs skins armor parts and helmets actually gives players the ability to customize their warframes to suit their own taste tldr simply the best free game ive played before and i 100% recommend it
recommended
fast paced 3rd person action with elements of parkour includes different mission types or game modes like defense survival domination extinction etc lots of items to craft and earn whilst you can play it completely free or pay to progress faster very fun game if you like to be a space ninja
recommended
its a very nice rpg a bit organic with the idea of missions rather than quests i get very strange feelings of other games with this such as borderlands mass effect prototype i really like it even when i get bored because as soon as i pick it up itll be hard to put down
recommended
the best f2p game i ever played
recommended
well what i can say about this game in 1st time when i played i didint like it that much and i left at some point maybe because 1 friend of mine witch we no longer friends are over annoyed me but like few mounths later i returned this game again and give it another shot and over all this game is really cool talking about choises use guns and swords but i basicly stick with swords most of the time anyways warframe become better and better by over time sure it have some issues were game can freeze if youre in party and can disconnect you from it but still i recoment this game to people who likes shooting killing stuff  ninjas  flying in space and farming alot
recommended
this game is very fun i enjoy the concept of ninjas in space almost as much as i enjoy zombie games i have played this for about a year now and still have things to do as this game continues to expand it keeps me busy on days i have nothing to do and it offers cooperative gameplay so i are meeting new people every game
recommended
so far i have really like this game the game play and the customizabilty are awesome as of right now the only constructive critizism i have is that when you are in front of an enemy plainly in thier line of site they dont see you if you are outside of a 5 meter radius roughly so the only thing i would change to make it more realistic would change that enemys will engage once you are in thier line of site within a reasonable distance

warframe is a fast paced f2p game that rewards long time players over buying ingame items warframe may seem hard at first to play but the game only gets more easy the longer you stick with it even offering some of the best ingame weapons for free during events that are more often than you think and special dates like christmaseaster etc warframe has a massive amount of content to explore including framesweapons and even pets the way to aquire these items is through collecting materials throughout the solar system and at first glance it would give the impression of too much grinding but it encurages you to explore and seek out new planets and rewards warframe does have a paid for currency that allows you to buy nearly anything in the game but what warframe has that others games dont is that you can trade for that currency with rewards you have earned by playing the game warframe does have problems though with some of the best content being far to hard to get even for long time players and balancing on weapons and frames is a very rocky path with some of the best content being reduced to mastery fodder overall warframe is not for everyone but is lots of fun to play and is updated every wensday with new content and provides lots of enterainment its a must play f2p game
recommended
its pretty good
recommended
i really enjoyed this game because every mission can be approached in many different ways
recommended
one of the best free to play great gaming experience best graphic quality for a free to play genre till now smooth gameplay its a must try game for a free to play great coop hack and slash game
recommended
the gameplay is solid the game is fun at first depending on your tolerance for grinding it can either stay that way forever or get boring really fast there will be a point where all you can do is grind and try to have fun shooting the same ai monsters over and over again for unlikely minor upgrades i recommend trying it its free but dont expect to be entertained forever

ninjas in space that kick a$ tha $ht

awesome game combines ninjas space and guns but the best part is your katana which looks epic as you power it up
recommended
in my opinion the greatest game release in the past two years in one years time the game size has grown from 1 gig to 6 the game population has grown from 100k to 10 million the core of the game has snowballed and grown without sacrafice it is legitimately playable for free you can beat the game with the starting gear you can obtain any gear in the game without paying it looks amazing has low requirements is played as coop or competative based on how you want to play it brings no new concepts that i am able to observe however it brings concepts together that have never been combined in mass or on this scale it combines these pieces with a precision and dependability i have never befor encountered i would go into description of these details but they are to numerous to name and are best observed by playing the game if you dont like warframe now you should check back in one year as it will have likely doubled the types of human experiences available in that time period the most impressive game of a age
recommended
an amazing third person shooter game i dont like the time that you have to wait for blueprints to finish 12 hours some 24 but overall the game is hell of an addicting game
recommended
its amazing game here is team play guns super suits game is new and developers improve it and you can help them enjoy
recommended
great game for all skills upgrade system is hard to learn but once u do its very helpfull wide veriety of weps and skins evrything is able to be found in the game but thats the hard part
recommended
a great game good points great movement system can get 99% of the stuff with out paying real money really fun to play with freinds can be played solo no two games will be the same bad points none in my opinion p 
recommended
played it liked it at first started to fall short after a few hours of game play and now sits there in my game list collecting dust but still a fun game for free  try it out its worth the download
recommended
often described as a pay to win game i found that not to be the case warframe is a third person shooter that is easy to pick up and rewards players who put time and effort into the game the initial learning curve is set quite high but can be made easier with help from the rather polite online community missions can seem repetitive at times but the constant addition of new content and game mechanics make warframe always feel fresh being still only in beta there are a few minor bugs that stop it from being one of the top free to play games around these issues however hardly detract from the game itself and are only noticible because the rest of the game feels so polished overall warframe is a genuinely good game that has a lot of things going for it i look forward to the developers live release and whatever additional changes accompany it
recommended
very fun game for a free 2 play game it is my favourite there is basically it is ninjas in space but it is a good concept no story but it does have a rich lore why yu no have warframe huh huh huh got warframe do it for the shibes doge translation such wow such space so violent very ninja such fun
recommended
its a nice unknown game for lots of people  there are lots of  things about it which i enjoy and like  fluent graphics  swords guns style  ninja fighting in outer space it is one good weird fun game   but it needs a work of improvement on the story to make it more interesting 
recommended
what are you waiting for dont play this game alone bring your friends and get the full coop experience
recommended
too many times i have approached a game and found that the stress on pvp is over done and there is no way to play with the same feel and not have to worry about long term players or bots warframe changed all this for me a shooter game with more than one twist i fell in love almost immediately the lore is limited they are building on it as we speak its in an exciting phase and it does look pay to win on the surface it is not the crafting is a secondary feature of this game its a something to do with the parts and the materials you gain ive lost count of the number of frames ive stumbled over the resources for and the amount of weapons ive crafted because they look like a bit of fun if you think the focus of the game is to be completionist and own all the things then youve missed the point the point is to play and play you can warframe runs you through an ever increasing series of different mission types from the need to stealth missions to succeed to defense attack and outright destruction they listen to their fanbase and the game grows through the love from the fans and the developers winner of mmobombs mmo of the year 2014 something has to be going right here for those that love the thrill of the fight to fantasise on their own lore as the game develops and to watch an already fabulous beta blossom into greater things this is the game for you grab your rifle and your sword and get to killing things
recommended
this is awesome game for those player who want to play some space third person shooter by yourself or with friends also it is really cool how game is constantly being updated there are a lot of costumization and playability in warframe recommended
recommended
in the past when i first tried this game it was awful each level was long difficult and had very little variety it was so mindnumbingly boring that warframe became difficult to play each level was the same layout with a slightly different skin on it one would play a level and the next level would be the exact same thing but with ice ohhh exciting except it wasnt at all since then warframe has improved a tremendous amount and is legitimately rather fun to play finding new areas and little hidden sections while exploring a map is fun and often results in some more or less useful resources the flow of the game is alot smoother and enemies do not indefinitely respawn which made the game much harder before ive had some pretty great times with warframe and its much better than it once was though the copy and paste level layouts are still the same it doesnt feel as empty and dull as it did in the past two comments that i must make however is the amount of time it takes to gather resources needed to advance in strength and level and playing with a controller the controller layout is absolutely horrid and you must redo it all and test with it before you can find something that works the sensitivity is way too high and the button layout is simply difficult and hard to understand overall i give this game a 710 its a good game but players that dont like alot of grinding and hate some repentition will quickly get bored of it

warframe it is most definately one of the best free multiplayer third person shooters i have ever had the honor to play i would honestly reccomend this game above many triple a titles the game itself has a decisive and interesting backstory many playable warframes with unique and interesting mechanics that give your specific choice meaning in a varity of mission settings also perhaps one of the most important features its a constantly evolving game new missions and interesting additions are being added in monthly giving this amazing game a everchanging face and the fact youll be supported by three additional tenno three other players all working towards the same goal means the missions the people and the very game itself is ever changing depending on the people you join with  it also has some interesting endgame content that relies far more on teamwork and less on pure shooting and running off on your own this can make it it even more complex and interesting later game so remember folks gun or blade are not a tennos best friend trust in your warframe but even more trust in your allies i am the lotus i will guide you but we must hurry vor is coming for you i see the cryosleep has taken your memory it doesnt matter you are tenno i will prepare you
recommended
i would recommend this one s little one needs to know space ninjas space ninjas and massacre action missions too it is indeed the best team game of the era in my opinion mechanics are quite nice too what with the wall running for example plenty of hopping around

very good graphics and quality i really do recommend playing with a friend or other people but its still fun playing solo i recommend it to people who like thirdperson shooters and a very large and long campaign

the best things about this game exist entirely by accident from the developers manages to be both the least fun rng fueled  grindfest ive played and also best relaxing just destroy hundreds of enemies at once with ridiculously overpowered weaponry for no particular reason game at the same time really grindy and buggy10
recommended
this game is really fascinating the graphics gore and getting to create your character with upgrades with melee weapons and ranged weapons its one of the best freetoplay games i have ever played and i never stop playing it as you kill more enemies and completing missions on the solar map your level progresses and once your bar reaches to the next level you have to prove your skills in a training area to go up the next level having abilities for example like snow globe you create a globe with a snow storm inside and when enemies go inside they slow down making it much easier for you to stay alive and kill as much enemies as you can also protects you from enemy projectiles coming towards you soul punch to knock your enemy back with one hit if theyre a low level terrify to scare your enemies away so you can slaughter them with pleasure  melee weapons like duel blades duel daggers long swords one handed swords scythes duel scythes axes all for the best of blood and gore ranged weapons like shotguns pistols duel pistols rifles sniper rifles machiene guns bow and arrows throwing knifes really good fun for sneaky missions and loud party missions too  mission types like sabotage when you go to the base core and destroy it leaving no enemies behind eliminate not leaving one single enemy alive spywhen youspy not good for explaining that lol capture when you capture the enemy and kill enemies in your way to escape rescue to free a prisoner and protect him as you run back to safety assassinate when you kill the enemy boss and hisher guards but the whole game is really fun and i suggest you give it a try thanks for reading ^^

so this is a game called warframe and you use the suits in warframe called warframes and in warframe with the warframes you use play warframe and with the warframes you slice people up with swords and guns and stuff youre also a space ninja is there anything else needed to be said also play as raiden and other metal gear characters 1010 would roleplay again

this game has very satisfying improvements and events when playing it drives you to think different createful battleground and you can specialize almost anything n this atmosphere you might be remember starwars but no one knows whats coming on to you soo you have to prepare yourself for harder battles with researching and improving process like  here some info to starters vor lotus hmm im tenno lotus right vor enemy what im gonna do now weapons warframes discovering worlds to get a weapon gotta go to is drop spots how im gonna get there i cant im low mastery should use market to access some medium weapons i get blueprint now what ts still there in foundry i need components to make it where can i find these hmm in starmap or so called navigation console there is component list on every planet i can use the list to find my component farm spot but its so far that planet i need to go no problemo just write to chat recruit tab lf looking for taxi to  planet name then someone takes you to somewhere in the planet u wanted to go after farming components make ur weapon and level it up in some defence mission now before u building ur warframe look far all warframes in codex youtube warframe wiki pick 23 warframe differently for different missions make them in foundry like making weapons when u need a credit play void missions or dark sector missionsin low tax spots

all i can say about this one is that i am shocked that a game like this one is free to play actually i can really see myself spending money on this game however like any free to play game it is packed full of micro transactions making it so you can buy the things you want however this game seems more generous in that aspect you can either buy it with real money or you can keep playing and earn credits in the game to aquire the same things that people would buy with their own cash the graphics in this game are top notch as well as the overall gameplay the game has been built so you can experience this game alone or with your friends and random people online who would wish to accompany you on your quests this game is very much worth looking into if you are in anyway intrested in a futuristic cenario which takes place in space the game on top of looking good also seems like it is willing to offer a lot of gameplay both through many planets and objectives through the solar system as well as replayability to either find resources to rebuild your character or just replaying a map as a newly built character it seems you can build your character to either be a spectre in the shadows taking enemies out without anyone knowing you were even in the area or a blood lusting banshee screaming through and leaving death in your wake however if this was too long one word to sum this game up really space ninjas go play it

warframe is an action game in which you control a warframe a robot ninjaesque character with a specific set of 4 abilities that are unique to that warframe at the time of writing there are 22 warframes to choose from but you have a limited amount of slots to keep these warframes in unfortunately to unlock more slots you have to play real world money but provided you have a job you do have a job right you wont go bankrupt from this there are multiple types of missions ranging from assassinations to exterminations to mobile defense you can play solo or with up to 3 other people and you can drop in or drop out at any time playing warframe with a group of friends is seriously some of the most fun you will have in a free to play game but playing solo isnt that great luckily if you have no friends you can join random people online so you never have to worry about going solo unless you want to but why would you everything in warframe requires resources which can be obtained from different planets if you want one resource in particular youll have to go to a planet that contains that resource because they differ from planet to planet in order to get parts to get a new warframe however youll have to farm the boss of the planet and while it can be a chore it is alleviated a little bit if youre farming with friends or at least with other people for a free to play game warframe has a lot of content and a pretty fair market system the only thing you have to pay money for are cosmetics and have no effect on the game whatsoever everything else can be obtained for free in conclusion warframe is a very fun free to play game that increases exponentially in value if you have some friends with you while it can be a grind sometimes and a little repetitive this game is definitely worth your time and if you can grab some friends youll probably lose some sleep playing this game and hey its free so what do you have to lose download warframe and try it out you wont be dissapointed gameplay 455 graphics 45 story 35 replayability 455 sound 45 value 55 overall a very strong recommendation this might just be the best free to play game out there

space ninjas doing space ninja things very addictive if a bit repetitive and grindy but the game is very agile just the way i like it and the gunplay is very rewarding once you move from starting gear if theres one gripe i have with the game its that i wish that there were more flat walls in some of the levels to take advantage of the highly agile moveset that includes things like review is now building in the foundry 235950 remains rush for 25 plat walljump and wallrun but aesthetically most are like what an alien ship would probably look like on the interior so i cant really complain much yes you should play it must have lots of patience and dedication

warframe and the negative and positive things about it gameplay the gameplay of warframe well its alright not that bad if i am to say the gameplay can be fun because there are several ways to play it in you can do the missions ingame quickly by rushing it with teammates or go slowly throughout your missions there are various places to explore within the game with missions and neutral areas you can travel throughout the entire universe visit every planet there is and even its neutral social base the tenno platform there is a variability within designing things although they cost most of the time color packs will cost you platinum which is an ingame credit gotten by buying it color packs forms and design you can design an entire guild base with it developing slowly by having everyone of your guild working together to finish everything the base of the guild is quite huge and grand it will keep you occupied the color packs can be bought later on but the starter pack of colors will give you a bit to work with for the time and design your warframe weapons banners and added customisations multiplayer gameplay in warframe there is a multiplayer platform in which you can actually go from 4 towards 7 teammates in total you can rush a lot of missions or have more difficult fights within other missions there are several survival missions or control missions there is also the defense system in which you and your teammates will have to defend something in the mission all in all the gameplay might have its bugs sometimes with disconnecting and reconnecting every now and then but its worth the while weaponry in this game there is a huge variability of weapons to choose from there is the primary weapon that can be a rifle sniper shotgun or bow the secondary weapon that can be a pistol two pistols or more forms of smaller guns then there is the meele weapon the weapon that will help you in a lot of situations and is one of the few most overpowered weapons in the game there is a variability of what kind of weapon you can get but there is also the negative side of it where you have to buy a lot of them with platinum credits or by farming and creating which will also keep you occupied note customisation will still be there warframes warframes are the characters that you will be using within the game and will be able to design and customise you can add several colors or mods to your warframe sadly warframe spots need to be bought but youll get a few to use from playing the game for a long time the start of the game will give you a good choice of three warframes that you can pick to start with in which youll have to take the best choice for yourself a normal warframe can be upgraded from normal to prime after doing some challenging missions you can upgrade it with new parts all in all the warframe system will keep you occupied enough to play it for a long time until you grow sick of it all mods mods are addons in the game that will keep you occupied to customise what you want your weapons to do andor your warframes to do you can add damage elemental effects or more within the game with mods you can also level mods by adding and comparing mods to each of them so they become more powerful and make the gameplay more fun for you all in all rating all in all the game has some negative and positive things positive gameplay graphics variability of weapons creativity exploration ingame customisation occupation throughout the gameplay variability of warframes negative requires platinum in a lot of situations will be taking a lot of time for constructions might get on your nerves from time to time vote 910 would get anytime

right so lets start this out with a negative after a big update avoid this like the plague for a week while they iron out the bugs now then for the review of all the mmos ive played both big and small new and old warframe is the most addicting with all its constantly updating and increasing features it still remains the most player friendly fun and the cheapest free to play game on the market i have spent over a year now playing it met nice people and joined a terrific clan when it was just created and small now its one of the top clans in the game and i enjoy the company of everyone in it ive fought all the bosses done all the events and even found that my gotta catchem all mentaulity can easily be achieved with little or no money spent on my part since outside of most cosmetics everything can be gained by just playing the game and with a good friend or clan you can get it all in no time and have a blast the whole way through it all from start to finish so to sum my review up it has bugs and the storyline is still being made as we all go and its an mmo so youll feel small and lost at the start but this game is worth playing

space ninjas doing space ninja things very addictive if a bit repetitive and grindy but the game is very agile just the way i like it and the gunplay is very rewarding once you move from starting gear if theres one gripe i have with the game its that i wish that there were more flat walls in some of the levels to take advantage of the highly agile moveset that includes things like review is now building in the foundry 235950 remains rush for 25 plat walljump and wallrun but aesthetically most are like what an alien ship would probably look like on the interior so i cant really complain much yes you should play it must have lots of patience and dedication

warframe is a free online rpg on a miniature scale that is played in a browser like internet explorer or firefox the graphics have not evolved or look like they have been upgraded since 1996 it does not have the saving grace of being an e type of game for little kids either even though the graphics are kiddy type at first look you might think that warframe is merely stupid and childish but the underlying deceptiveness of this chat based experience is not apparent right away this is a game that looks like it is for 7 year olds in reality its far from it it does not carry a warning to parents or have a date of birth filter on it by being free to play the game circumvents the requirements that supposedly protect kids from adult content even though one shouldnt judge game developers by what the players have done with their online game at some point the developers do have to acknowledge what is being done with the user created content and deal with it in a responsible fashion players chat freely about real life and more adult content unsuitable for minors takes place that needs to be addressed with this game

warframe is a free to play tps  hack n slash coop game with stealth and parkour elements in it the player becomes one of the tenno space ninjas awakened from a long slumber who control powerful suits known as warframes which provide different abilities and allow them to tackle on dangerous jobs from lotus the graphics are just incredible each location has their own design style the environments are shiny and rich in details while the special effects are just plain beautiful the only downside might be the fact that the last one can be a little bit too distracting at times and hard to see through during a fight in the sound department the music is appriopriate to the situation speeds up when in a fight for example and whatever plays in the background is usually the theme of the faction youre fighting against though it can get overriden by the boss theme if someone like that appears the sound effects arent anything special but they are appriopriate in the sound department the each faction and most locations get their unique music tunes which also change according to the situations intensifies when youre in a fight calms down when you werent detected yet the voice acting is also really good even if a bit scarce the gameplay consists of you and up to three other players deploying on a mission and completing a specific objective like killing all enemies or capturing important targets while moving through randomlygenerated rooms you get to use between three weapons  primary secondary and melee which can be of many different types like shotguns rifles pistols shurikens swords axes  as well as an assortment of movement options including but not limited to sprinting sliding wallrunning etc you can also attack enemies while performing any of those maneuvers giving you a large degree of freedom as to how and when to move in and strike as far as stealth elements go you can obviously use cover to keep yourself out of sight of enemies you can also use silent weapons like bows and shurikens to take them out from a distance or sneak up behind them and perform an instakill stealth execution the mechanics are very solid and its fun slicing stuff down there is also the archwing and its own missions where you move in nogravity using the eponymous mechanical wings shooting down foes akin to a space shooter while it isnt as diverse as the standard gamemode it is a good change of pace from time to time not to mention even more awesome the amount of equipment types of environments and missions you can encounter is staggering the diversity is what keeps it from getting too stale another good thing is that the multiplayer functions pretty well  even with high ping you will notice an obvious delay but it wont impact your experience or general gameplay that much i think this is it for the pros so lets start counting out the cons the game is still quite obviously a glorified grind to get better stuff fortunately most of the time its somewhat fun to play speaking about multiplayer if the hosts computer lags horribly due to all the stuff going on in the game you can expect your gameplay to be similarly laggy with everything flash stepping all over the place another bad thing is the fact that enemies are horrendously stupid performing a stealth execution together with screams of pain does not itch the rest of the guards five meters ahead to look behind themselves you can snipe someone with a bow and no one will find anything particularly weird in a ragdolling corpse going halfway across the room they also tend to take cover at not exactly the best spots or forget that you just sped right past them and still sit there waiting in cover just being covered from the wrong direction harder missions only strengthen the enemies stats together with spawning elites more often and sometimes new types of enemies also another thing is that the game requires a lot of grinding to even get moderately powerful at the beginning youre going to struggle to complete the missions that arent the absolute simplest of all since you dont have much resources to manufacture new stuff and the starting equipment is very weak and even if you do get strong weapons theyre not going to be powerful enough with a good assortment of highrank mods for them to customize their damage output of course if you have a friend whos been playing the game for quite some time and is willing to help you out in getting started this becomes a bit less of an issue the amount of slots you get for equipment is also very limited while it isnt so bad with weapon and sentinel slots you get only two warframe slots for starters kind of limiting your options as to how many roles you can fill in a team you really need more slots to be able to do something besides one or two things the last thing is the fact that the game is pretty glitchy objects can spawn at wrong places due to random generator just messing up or you can land outside the map fall into the void and be forced to revive due to a collision detection glitch or a lag spike and this isnt an uncommon occurence it happened to me three times  overall this is a grindy and harsh at the beginning but very fun game once you get far enough you should check it out if you dont mind a sluggish beginning especially if youve got more experienced friends who can help you get running

its free play it can be grindy or repetitive for new players but once you find your place in the game and have others around you to play with itll keep you interested for a good while updates all the time a devteam players actually like and enjoyable gameplay await this game is free to play and has its premium currency like any other but you dont have to pay anything to get the premium content if you work for it thanks to the games trading system that premium content is largely limited to cosmetic items anyway so you wont be at a great disadvantage either way its still free you should try it

im heated right now i love the game but i just stayed up late as hell on a work night doing a defense mission i had a good team and got to the 25th level i figured it was time to go since i was tired and didnt want to lose everything i had so i pressed extract and 100% did not press continue boom everyone else extracted and it kept me there alone so i obviously got  on the 26th wave and had to quit and i didnt get anything i mean what better way to stay up late on a work night seriously this game is fun and this is just me venting because im furious but seriously wtf why did everyone else get to extract but i had to stay alone only to die and lose ing everything i have so much anger right now and nowhere to put it now im going to lie awake wishing i could smash a developers head into a curb because clyde frog is upset 910 on the game though just hope you dont ever get ed like i just did

well everyone seems to be playing this now took a long at this long ago and have to admit i did not think a whole lot of it started playing again early february 2014 after a few friends asked me to and it was fun to dip into again the initial grind to get anywhere else past your initial warframe and weapon loadout is a little much but hey its a free to play game and they have to see if youd be willing to drop money on it at least some way after that though lots of fun reminds me of mass effect 3 multiplayer a lot with more looting and actually gathering the stuff you find and crafting it into things you like rather than spend the credits you receive on boxes which contain random items in them so this now fulfills my needs to be a futuristic ninja slashing  gunning down things fun stuff

similar in some ways to the multiplayer experience seen in mass effect 3 warframe wastes no time in telling stories particularly elaborate the background narrative in fact will give us an excuse to put ourselves in the shoes of ninja called to fight a futuristic alien faction home menu you can choose between different worlds to visit where we await missions to complete possibly in the company of three other players challenge between intergalactic ninja the objectives vary enough but the main flaw of the title digital extremes is out soon given the limited variety of levels you will be prompted to save the hostages locate a reactor to destroy or find an object but whatever the delivery in warframe youll almost always eliminate waves of enemies chasing the various waypoint marked on the map the gameplay fortunately fairly obvious problems of repetition of the title with the view placed behind our tenno the name of the metal ninja who impersonate we will have firearms and trusts katana come into play the warframe champions representing the different possible configurations of the armor these identify the different classes of ninja with unique features useful to customize the game experience challenge between intergalactic ninja initially there are three while the other can be purchased with real money or get through the crafting system included in the title the warframe not only change the appearance of your character but activate specific skill such as enabling stealth attacks rather than providing armor thicker than usual and so on the user then accesses to further customizations to buy with credits earned in each mission completed successfully these enhance the efficiency of its warframe but not only there are in fact many consumable items to carry around for the later missions useful to address the weaknesses of its configuration and style of play

this game is very addicting its fun exciting yet a bit clunky they nerfed the guns and damage with the release of the ps4 version you do not have to paytowin all you have to do is fight endless waves on defense mode to get you inventory filled with valuable mods then wait a couple days to build new weapons to upgrade your weapons i have played without paying a dollar and still hold up in deathmatches you either have to pay or you have to sign in for 7 consecutive days and hope to heck you get the random item you need to upgrade your gunmelee for additional modsadditional damage i was very upset with the nerfing of the mods with the release of the ps4 version my pistol was one shot on any enemy at any level with the new updates my guns have been completely nerfed and do less than half of the damage they did before was a real dissapointment since i spent alot of time upgrading my pistol specifically for instant damage all in all i recommend this game but its seeming to become more and more pay to win with each coming update lets hope the devs release some additional features and weapons for broke  players like myself

sadly this game was at its best on closed beta it just went downhill from there it started focusing on the wrong things and changing things that worked fine just for the sake of it instead of building upon some of the most satisfying mechanics on an online game and then the balance just went down the drain its still a good game and one that everyone should try its just not as good as it could have been 710

this is collected from opinions of more than 10 people with whom i have played the game extensively dont believe the hour count games welloptimized and stable for me so i leave it running in background very often i have around 100 hours of gameplay in it so far maybe little less 3rd try jesus this game is hard to review its not a shooter so dont expect that this is a diablostyle game a world of rng loot showers grind lots of content and indepth character and equipment customization its pros include  lots of content like a huge amount hundreds of mods for equipment 150 weapons 20 warframes each with unique and interesting style and abilities and almost all ugly as  hundreds of missions unlocks a bunch of bosses 4 enemy factions story quests and a  dog yes there is even a pet system for some reason wtf i dont know  pretty lights welloptimized especially for nvidia and extrapretty graphics hd textures lots of options physx particles that are wholly misused and spam the screen while having no gameplay enhancing purpose but hey all this looks really colourful and pretty  good developer constant updates all the time responsive to feedback professional and passionate those guys know what they are doing and can be trusted to keep improving the game it is getting better overall with updates though they made a few mistakes along the way but when they set out to improve a particular area they usually succeed and deliver what the players ask for  great lore unique and mysterious lore set this game apart unfortunately there isnt much of it maybe they are saving it up for the new story quest system they added in u14  enormous equipment customization this is the main skill of the game  making a good build there are hundreds maybe already over a thousand different mods and you can put 8 on a piece of equipment this system is very good but is unfortnately plaigued by f2p curse i will mention it in cons  loot its like torchlight but with an overtheshoulder perspective tons of loot and rewards all showering you in a spectacular fireworks of colours and sparkles if you like loot you will like warframe its cons are  its not a shooter it requires no skill whatsoever success is determined entirely by rng its all in levels equipment and % unless you count aiming as a criteria for skillbased gameplay this game s only skill is making a roll at the right time to negate knockdown everything else is rng  technically same as above but its so big that it deserves a point of its own abilities are rng as well they are the second major combat tool after guns and they require energy to use that does not renegerate but drops from enemies randomly its incredibly infuriating for people like me who are very very unlucky in games i am pretty much either forced to use just guns or the efficiency build which is very restrictive for some warframes this is a terrible decision and i am baffled that they still havent even put a mod in that disables the energy orb pickups but gives you a potent energy recharge instead  f2p curse up until you have a potato a paid item that is incredibly difficult to get for free you dont have a choice with equipment customization every equipment item has the nonpotato build that you must use and cant deviate from  there is a polarity system that requires you to relevel items to make them able to have more mods leveling items in warframe is a giant chore and really frustrating and not fun the first time you get mastery from them so it helps a but but later you are just using the thing for ages despite being sick of it just to get to rank 30 releveling should happen at 23 times the current rate for it to be an enjoyable mechanic but now its awful and its one of the major downsides of the game  rng everything in warframe is controlled by rng roll the dice is the second name for this game consequently if you arent lucky you will have a bad time unless you manage to get some good friends who are lucky and can help you out which is what i did when i need to farm something really rare i just go with some friends who are lucky and i usually get it but never with randoms or alone no matter how much i try this is rng and welcome to jackass  enemy scaling is mmorpgstyle they scale with damage and health and they scale hard not special abilities new ai rules and such but just enormous hp and 1hks needless to say this does nothing for the appetite  enemies are games biggest gameplay issue they have different attacks sure but they are mostly noninteractive and completely nonreactive if an enemy can pull you it will pull you regardless of you being immune or behind cover further the spawn compositions are static and not reactive either and theres no significant differences between both enemy looks and their stats all in all the enemies are completely noninteractive all you can do with them is ragdoll them and kill them thats it neither their ai responds to player actions nor their spawns nor their states  level design levels are comprised of randomly arranged rooms each of which dont benefit the level in any way like forevener here told me and he is very much correct in that regard the game suffers from levels being completely linear theres no reason to consider the room ahead cuz you have to go through it anyway furthermore theres no reason to explore rooms and use the parkour it is not a good combat strategy and chests outside of void do not give good enough rewards for exploring each room thoroughly levels do not affect flow of combat and gameplay ok that covers all this game is really difficult to review theres a lot there and it is being constantly updated take a look the start might be rough but stick around play with some nice veterans theyll help you out and you can find your fun the gameplay may suffer from rng and enemy design resulting in lack of skill but it makes up for it with content and the variety in which the damage may be pumped out even if there is never thought required for it or nothing to make you think before shooting if nothing else where else can you grow a ing space dog

well what can i say i never had so much fun alone or with friends for while with game and even with so many changes since i started playing warframe at closed beta i still have some enjoyment after so many hours for a f2p title have a quality above what most players expect it is a hardcore grind game but it can also be rewarding it all depend the way you aproach the game and it is also important to prevent the burnout phase we achieve in grind games warframe have very diferent modes like exterminate capture mobile defense and the new intermission the other modes are endless you can play until you cant stand anymore that is survival & defense modes they can be very challenging even when we max all our mods and weapons i would avoid trading at least at start bc if you dont have anything to do you will become bored and reach burnout sooner missing some good experience that warframe have to offer
recommended
its a grind that much is certain i recommend new players use the platinum given to you to buy warframe slots that way you have access to 4 warframes in the future the allure of overpowered weapons and frames is present for sure but getting more slots gives you more playstyle choices later on 300 hours and i keep coming back for more

i love[b] everything about this game you can use any warframe you like with money you can customize your warframe color and style with money but do you want to be a godlike[b]  then you must earn it by play real hard for free and by play real hard i mean play real hard[b]  what a wonderful[b] game ps you need time and luck on this one

if you have ever seen the movie pitch black or any of the other riddick media you may have thought why do these guys keep going after riddick he kills everyone and blows up all their homes and businesses why are they still going after him why warframe is a game where you play as a tenno tenno are a race of people that are just so flippin nasty that it makes no sense why you would ever pursue them these crazyasses wont hesitate to wipe you the funk out at the drop of a hat there are these three space armies that just never learn the grineer the corpus and the infested these fools just never learn they spot a tenno and they just think maybe i could kill that tenno yeah i`ll be the one to succeed where ever single other has failed nope

where to start with warframe well the whole space ninja promotions are very well deserved the lore is cool it looks beautiful for a f2p game and the gameplay is solid and very satisfying however there are some things that can irk and even push away new players if they arent prepared for it first the good stuff the first major thing is that its free to play meaning no purchase to play this thing no need to explain that this game is gorgeous seriously one of the best looking f2p games out there the designs of all the enemies weapons and player characters are also extremely cool looking for those who are into it the game has a pretty good upgrade system you can specialize your character and weapons with a variety of different upgrades for maximum efficency there are a whole bunch of missions to do so you wont have a lack in content for some time also the dev team is really good with updates getting them out very quickly the gameplay is most likely the best part parkouring around the area fighting with gunkatamixture of guns and melee weapons and having 4 different abilities for each character at your disposal the coop is also very good a great game to play with friends now there might be more but overall its a very good game but i would hurt myself if i didnt mention the bad stuff this game acts a lot like raiding in mmos at endgame if you play with strangers most will expect you to be fully decked out with the right mods and weapons this can get frustrating as ive had instances where people would leave because i didnt have the right mod setupmore of a personal gripe but something good to know if you plan on going completely f2p with this game expect a  ton of grinding you basically have to build everything so that means farming for resources and waiting for the item to be built to put this into perspective building a weapon takes about 24 hoursmaybe 12 i cant seem to remember and building a character takes about 3 days this game can be very daunting when first getting in the tutorial helps with gameplay but navigating the map and understanding what does what is left out my suggestion is to go onto youtube and look up some usermade tutorials two youtubers id recommend are mike b for his crash course in warframe videos which mainly help with better understanding your characters and mogamu who does the same thing though he takes closer looks at the weapons and whether or not theyre worth your time both are great for getting a headstart in how you want to play all in all this is a fantastic game the main problems i have with it can be easily solved with patience and research before you jump right in you should at least try this out since you wont be losing money in the process

this game is a fantastic mmotpsrpg you take the role of a tenno a being who has been in stasis for a very long time and attempt to bring balance back to the solar system guided by a mysterious entity known as the lotus you seek to survive and thrive in this instancebased coop mmo graphics running max graphics  physx the in game graphics engine is absolutely gorgeous from high bloom and glorius physx particles to the animations of the movements of all beings scifi seems extremely realistic without setting a ridiculous bar for whats necessary to play the game all of the warframe abilities have satisfying amounts of graphical work done and with the newest update npc voices also have 3d moving portraits in a very starcraftesque manner other than some minor graphical bugs such as a vent grate floating a couple inches off the floor everything looks very well polished some people may feel that the bloom is just too much for them and luckily there is an option to turn it off if so desired gameplay moving around in a warframe feels very fluid and natural and as a member of the design council i can vouch for des continued efforts at making this even more natural where possible wall running scaling jumping sliding rolling all seem very well mocapped and only at very few points in the game does movement become an issue such as getting stuck behind a pipe or such combat feels just as natural as well while there is no snap to cover system being able to switch shoulders makes for easy adjusting guns feel adequate in their power and recoil with some weapons like revolvers kicking much more than a light assault rifle as they should ammo is never truly a problem if played well but can become a concern for those that prefer to use bows or snipers as their ammo drops are fairly low understandably bullet based weapons are hitscan while energy and heavy projectile weapons will exhibit travel times but will not have drop associated with them melee weapons feel realtively fluid but seem somewhat weak this aspect however is getting a major overhaul soon and from what ive seen will be vastly improved warframe abilities are what bring a third dimension sometimes literally to combat in warframe no one frame is terrible compared to the others and those that feel underpowered are being looked at constantly for more reworking and balancing each frame is specialized to fulfill a certain role as such they wil cater to different mission types the highly mobile and damaging volt is much better at sabotage missions compared to the tanky cc based frost who is much better at defending than attacking this being said through the mod system warframes take on progression theres no reason that volt cant be defensive and frost the frontline attacker early on it wont matter too much which frames come into a game but down the road in the harder levels teams must be equipped to handle the right kinds of scenarios and enemies lest they face a constant uphill and sometimes impossible objective playing with others comes relatively easily in the game through either simply setting the game mode to online which makes it public or through asking around on the chat tab dedicated for such use for the most part the community in game is positive and helping towards its players although there will always be the occaisional sour apple in the bunch while there is an ingame comm system for voice chat in a squad i have never been a big fan of it opting instead for a thihrd party system due to voice clarity issues clans are a major part of the game and have over the past 5 patches been steadily improving these hubs serve not only just as a group of people but also as a home zone known as the dojo where players can practice fighting each other along with their freerunning skills and can unlock advanced weaponsframes through clan research this is also the place in which trade is conducted trading is still in its infancy for warframe having been released only a couple major updates ago the only items that can be traded currently are mods keys which are used for higherdifficulty content and platinum the microtransaction currency sound design the weapons and frames all sound very nice with a very mechanical gun sound on bullets with some cool scifi sounds on the energy weapons bows have a unique sound to them both realistic yet futuristic the game has very little in the way of a soundtrack relying more on drum rolls and simple beat patterns there are a couple points in the game that have music but there are only a couple tracks i would really like to see this part of the game grow as music is a huge part in the sell factor of a game and adds much needed depth to the missions and main screens player vs player this is still a relatively new facet of gaming for warframe the vast majority of gameplay centers around coop but there are currently two modes of pvp in the game the first and most accessible mode is known as conclave this features a map with obstacles and wall strewn about and is a 2v2 deathmatch as frames and weapons are ranked up and modded out they gain more conclave rating points the sum of your frame and weapons ratings creating your total conclave rating when searching for opposing players you will compete in a conclave tier with your rating or higher to ensure that newer players wont be completely facerolled the second mode is known as dueling this is a 1v1 cage match that is found in clan dojos and is used more for practice than actual combat although some clans like to use this as a method of judging ranks for players in their clans conclave being the main pvp mode is what i use for my overall pvp experience here in the review overall i found this game type to be very fun and exhilirating offering continually refreshing matches closing thoughts warframe is a solid and enjoyable game that doesnt require much money at all there is no paytowin content money definitely is a convenience especially when starting out but as a player progresses new items are easier to unlock and put less burden for money it should be noted that a player can only store 2 warframes and 8 weapons without paying platinum for extra slots but platinum can be earned in game by trading upgraded or rare mods to other players who want them platinum itself is relatively cheap requiring a modest amount of money that is often up for discount simply by logging into the game getting 20% coupons are really common with 50% and 75% coupons less so but still present de puts out an enormous amount of content for this game with a new weapon or two coming out every couple weeks and a new frame every month or two along with harder to find prime variants that have boosted stats these are more for bragging rights and lateend game than anything else they are taking this game on the right track and it continues to grow and evolve with a company that takes careful feedback from its player base early game play can get repetitive but trust me when i say that sticking through the early grind blossoms into a fantastic mid to late game and more content being released all the time players that have questions will find that getting answers is really easy as the community is easy to talk to and the game has a rich wiki warframewikiacom that has a crew that works all the time to keep it up to date with a rapidly evolving game overall score as of update 1201 8510 stunning visuals refreshing take on shooters unique progression systemspecializations amazing community amazing dev team almost nonexistent soundtrack early game can get quite repetitive lore needs more development this is becoming less of an issue with each successive patch

what is warframe well to put it bluntly its a game about space ninjasthats really it a bunch of traumatized space ninjas were forcibly put in some other dimension which is about as close to hell as reality gets most of them died and those who didnt became some of the most twisted dangerous creatures ever made to contain their power and their deformed bodies theyre encased in war frames which also help boost their powers sosuper hero space ninjasthats warframe the silly concept aside the game is actually pretty good i cannot imagine starting this game completely on my own the learning curve is pretty darned steep and i luckily had an experienced playercronxyx help me out and get started now in terms of graphics and computer stress this game does require a lot of it even at half resolution my computers not too happy about it and im playing on the lowest possible settings if you have an underpar computer which has trouble running games like csgo id not bother with this one itll be unplayable for you in terms of controls and mechanics the game can be fun but also very very annoying and itll most likely make your wrists hurt if you dont sit just right this applies mostly to melee combat though which is my chosen favoritewhy make a game about space ninjas if they can just pull out a space rifle and shoot things i have a samurai sword that sparks lightning at my hip damned right ill use it for example when going into melee mode your left mouse button is no longer attack but is held down to provide an energy draining power boost to your swings increasing damageand making you look super cool glowy and stuff while the e key becomes the new attack button meanwhile stamina and fatigue is incredibly scarce in this game granted how much movement you need to be doing thus many people have taken to the art of floor skatingyou sprint by holding down shift and in order to slide along the floor doing sparks and stuff you have to hold down ctrl at the same time and for an added boost you push e to make a forward dash slice attack to cover even more groundif done right you can cross an entire map instantlyand probably kill yourself as you fall into a pit when you do this over and over and over and over for hours youll find your left wrist is burning and slightly swollen so my advice is to tilt your keyboard slightly to the left since the arrow keys are useless here youll only be using the left side of your keyboard and your mouse however despite the hand breaking controls the demanding graphics and the kinda silly conceptspace ninjas hua hiah the game is tremendously fun and quite addicting the satisfying hack and slash and realistic ragdolling and the steep learning curve makes becoming good at this game a legitimate achievementi meanim still rank 0 and ive failed my rankup test 3 times nowps once you get ready to take the test make sure you are in the right warframeonce you have the option to take the test if you click no itll give you the cooldown anyway \  these rank up tests can only be attempted once a day24 hours so best be prepared before doing them my advice considering this games free yes id definitely give it a try ive played it for 2 days and am quite hooked thanks to cronxyx for introducing me to this game youre the best horsie a kitty could ask for <3

i once was a loki warframe i had come in on mercury fighting across the planet and completing various assignments then one day i killed captain vor i was so excited to get some new loot i moved on to venus and killed the jackal one day i made it to a defense mission i cleared through the corpus with ease slicing them down with my lv 18 skana i got to wave 10 and was offered a mod then i realized i could keep fighting to earn even better mods along with the north wind for my sword i kept fighting but they overtook me and killed the tenno inside the cryopod on wave 14 they took away all the mods they were going to give me i got nothing for my hard work trying to protect the cryo pod i cried for hours i sat next to my navigation console praying to the lotus that i could get the mods back then the lights flickered and the stalker jumped through my ships window he said to me your actions have consequences and then tackled me when i woke up i was completely naked but i had the north wind mod and a new pair of dual heat swords i smiled at him and he winked back and jumped through the window stalker is love stalker is life

this game is fantastic the devs are extremely active in the community there is a massive variation in weapons and warframes characters the levels are randomly generated with premade tile sets so levels are hardly ever the same the only thing i have against the game is the fact that it is a grinding game although honestly its not to much of an issue the gameplay is smooth and satisfying the best part is that this game is still in beta so it can only get better warframe doesnt deserve a 67100 from metascore
recommended
97100  pretty good controls once you get the hang of them  very unique abilities for each frame  many strategies are usually viable for every encounter  frame balance has improved a bit since my last review  good f2p system  everything can be obtained somehow for freeminus a few cosmetic things  unique diverse enemies especially the bosses  generous difficulty curve  very fast gameplay that adequately punishes for inattentiveness  receiving constant updates frequent events and timely developer responses  gmod ragdoll physics  story and lore content actually exist now and its constantly evolving with every update  voiceacting is pretty alright  the music is great  astronomical replayability  nifty weaponmodding system that actually does allow for a significant degree of customization  the archwing space combat sans spacecraft crap is incredibly disappointing  pvp is b r o k e n it does exist though in case you want to rally some friends and ban the ridiculous weapons  fairly smart ai for a multiplayer game  extremely expensive paid content  long crafting times for items but you can rush them for premium currency  grinding is a mildly significant part of the game  hosted clientlocally rarely leading to nasty lag this also means it will hose your connection if you are the host and you have a terrible isp  severe chronic power creep is a recurring theme  no official soundtrack available for purchase  still very buggy most bugs dont last too terribly long but they introduce new ones pretty regularly  the code that handles the intial connecting to other players is horrible  poor weapon balance  qa basically skips over the text

this game just keeps getting better sometimes you need to farm for resources but even farming is fun so many classes and weapons i dont know what to do with myself i totally reccomend this game and cant say enough good about it its better then pizza and pizza is amazing this game has so many hours worth of gameplay to it and yet its free my life is so simple and happy now that i have warframe d

its a really good game to play with friends as well with strangers but there lacks a lot of fun only downside of the game is that it kinda feels repeatable in way your mission dont really change that much its straight up go in killcollectprotect that and thats it

i got the game in july 2014 ive had steam since january 2014 between getting this game and now i now have more hours in warframe than all my other games combined in the last year this game has taken the throne of my favorite game ever something about it keeps me from burning out on it but then again minecraft did that for a while to and i havent played it in months so i may burn out on it but i dont see it happening in the near future the game is free to play and when people hear or see a free to play game they are afraid of it because of pay to win games the great thing about this game is some of the best weapons in the game are only achievable through gameplay alone while still giving people good incentive to pay the game looks and although it took me a while to get used to controls great my computer not the beefiest in the world and warframe can still keep a good fps maybe some lag if alot of things are happening or i have a bunch of other programs running in the background but overall lag free on my average powered computer i5 another thing that could draw people in is the mostly coop multiplayer when i first ran tf2 i got killed over and over by people much much better than me warframe is a mainly coop multiplayer meaning that if a n00b you may feel like a noob when you see your scores compared to others but dont have to worry about the same things as in competitive games and if you like there are still conflicts and dueling arenas where pvp is possible the amount of content is amazing how this game runs on my computer is amazing and the awesome devs keep adding more and keep the community somewhat hyped for new content with livestreams and feeds ive played 322 hours of this game and i am still learning more and more the community is great i probably wouldnt still be playing if i hadnt played woth or met people that were nice and helped me get better at the game all sorts of guides and hepful content exist for this game alot of my friends have burned out on this game but me and one other continue to play it more and more i believe this is just how you plaw games one friend of mine plays games as though he is a game reviewer plays about 510 hours then gets a new game he spent about 150 in warframe and stopped i on the other hand could never do that if the game allows i can spend months nearly two years in the case of ssbb practically only playing one game and not having an urge to play any others the same happened with awesomenauts minecrafttf2 and other console games that got a bit rambly but how long you remain playing this depends on you but it is definetly worth picking up and playing atleast 10 hours

the metacritic score is way off warframe is a great game nearly everything in the cash shop can be acquired by simply playing the game its a satisfying romp that feels like a mash up of devil may crygears of war gameplay with halomass effect themes in small parties like borderlandsleft 4 dead very enjoyable though the first 10 hours or so may feel a bit slow crafting your second warframe is when the game really opens up
recommended
warframe is a great game playing it by myself for a while made it seem horrible but then i started playing with friends from school it became one of the most played games in my library its a perfect game to nerd out with this needs more than an hour to get used to and to start having a lot of fun unless youre lucky and someone gives you a ton of gear it is a definitely a game you have to play over a long period it may take a while getting used to the odd playstylei just wish there was a bit more lore in the game this game is absolutely not pay to win but it is pay to look good nearly every weapon that can be bought with platinum has a blueprint version that can be bought with credits i myself enjoy collecting resources and building the blueprints more anyway again great game 910

great f2p game with high quality realisation on most aspects it can get you hooked to it for hours and youll find new things to do for a good while one of the few game where grinding here and there isnt a drag also and maybe i should have started with that its a game about space ninja wizards with guns and you play the space ninja wizards

17 hours in and i am not even level 2 the grind is hella real in this game but idk some people like that or maybe i just suck anyways this game is such a cluster  you got some robot  looking protagonists fighting a bunch of stuff and you get a samurai jack blade and the parkour skills of a 13 year old british boy and you are suppose to just go out it i also got butt  over and over when i tried to go to the harder levels i like it a ton  1013

recommended
first i hated this game but once one begins to progress you find the gameplay pacing something similar to goldeneye 64 and goldeneye 64 is a pretty fantastic game if you ask me

warframe ninjas play free warframe a free to play game with allot of potential of becoming a one of a kind it is a good looking coop ment to be game with a high chance of addiction if u want it all even though most loot is available without pay its a hell allot of time consuming and there for in my opinion a little nearing the pay to play side never the less i can honestly say with more than 400 hours of playing warframe im a fan i like the community of players in game and warframe has one of the best written wiki a game can have if not the best and the dedicated developers who are always working 100% bringing new stuff on a regular base for all players on pc or console get ready tenno

warframe while not being the best f2p games i have played is defiantly one of the better ones while it is true that you spend alot of time grinding and that the silveringame currency paid with real money is oddly expensive those do not take away the fun of the game

warframe is a cooperative freetoplay third person online action game set in an evolving scifi world and is currently in open beta join your friends in playervsenemy raids across the solar system and master the power of the warframes stand alone or fight together against enemies that threaten your world they were called tenno
recommended
holy crap 5 minutes 5 minutes into a mission was all i needed to know that i would love this game until the bitter end or my add kicked in wonderful 3rd person gameplay intensely stylized graphics and a rewarding and satisfying free2play experience so very often it seems that f2p means paytowin but not with this gem nope warframe will never beg a dime from you and you can live a very happy existence keeping it as free as the breeze you certainly can spend your monies on this game and buy dlc till youre opening up a second mortgage but the beauty to this beast is that you get a quality fun experience without ever feeling like you have to open up your wallet you do however owe something you owe yourself at least one playthrough i bet you wont entirely hate it disclaimer you may need a system that can handle all its bells and whistles

<updated review> >gets new pc >plays it >game looks beautiful ok instead mlg10 game rekt them all
recommended
even after 200 hours played i still cant wait to try out the next new thing another warframe or a new weapon each one feels sufficiently unique to keep the game fresh even after playing a lotl the thing people criticize is the farming and i absolutely agree i have neither the patience nor ambition to grind my way to whatever goal there is which is why i spent actual money on platinum and i dont regret it one bit yes you can play and achieve almost everything in the game without spending a penny and some people wear the fact that they never payed as a badge of honour personally i think that if a game gave me literally hundreds of hours of entertainment spending an amount that equates to the price of a regular game on this game is more than fair the developers need to live as well and in warframe they struck a good balance so that you never really feel pressured to buy platinum if you dont want to also once you have a littel platinum ready the trade system allows you to buy all kinds of stuff from other players for cheap so if you are ok with spending a few bucks in total you can get a good selection of mods and blueprints for very little money saving you the trouble of grinding

warframe while still a bit grindy at times is a fantastic coop shooter for anyone looking for over the top spaceninja action the only ftp game i have ever bought cosmetics for and as long as they are ones you really like well worth the cost upcoming feature as of june 2014 for those complaining of the lack of lore the developers have recently shown off previews of quest missions and also have been adding more and more cohesivelyconnected story events this game continues to escalate towards greatness update september 2014 this game is getting better every month at this point it is really getting polish less bugs overall better events more often cooler abilities better balance improved ui amazing across the board update december 2014 there is now a much more solid story happening the big events outcomes are actually swayed by how well the playerbase performs and we have spacemecha now that is all
recommended
this game is awesomei love it 3

this third person shooter regardless if its free or not is one of the best i have ever played for the following reasons first the pricing model is very fair as nearly everything can be obtained for free the way it works is that as you go out in missions you will obtain resoruces which can be used for building items second the devs are extremly dedicated to thier game warframe has gone along way since i played in august of 2013 there has been so many additions made such as the entire reworking of the melee system or being able to control portions of the solar system with your clanaliance upcomming additions include new environments and a reputation system with other factions third is the community of this game this out of other online games has one of the best communities nearly everone is friendly and helpful the two clans i have joined are laidback and fun almost everyone is willing to tag along with you on missions as everyone benefits in some way fourth which is the most important is the core gameplay what third person shooter allows you wallrun slide shoot and pull of destructive powers the movement is at most part fluid and fast besides some of the parkour the controls are easy to pick up but can be difficult to master as you can pull of complex moves with proper timing and button combinations however in no way shape or form is this game tatical it more of a crazy action game that is very quick this game can also get very difficult like you will be surrounded by over 2 dozen enemies and knocked down at the same time it is better to tag along with a group but solo play is good if you are looking for a challenge just make sure your weapons are leveled up finally is the overall presentation of the game the art style is really good and some of the characters and weapons look really cool from an artistic perspective on the technical side the game is mostly well optimised and at low settings which i am running at and even than it looks great the use of motion blur has been improved a bit an option for adaptive vsync has helped in reducing the tearing and studering however every game does have its flaws and warframe is no exception this game does have quite abit of bugs not bf4 bad but it does have it fair share of bugs for instance sometimes the limbs of dead enemies would randomly stretch out for a few seconds sometimes the difficulty randomly spikes on certain missions finally the game can be pretty unforgiving for new players as the game doesnt hold your hand after the short tutorial on a side note this is for ps4 users only the updates come much later than the pc version which the devs should work out with sony also the game can be abit of a grind at times overall warframe is a great game and the fact it is this level of quality at open beta means that the game will get progressivly better as time goes on note this is my first review so feel free to give me feedback in the comments section but please keep it constructive and polite
recommended
really good game it reminds me of mass effect but warframe is on steriods hahahahahaha
recommended
i enjoy warframe i already play it for 2 months and its still fun while most level have the same look the bulid of the map changes everytime with that i mean that while the same rooms appear its always random wich room is behind the next door despite what some people might say warframe is not pay2win the only thing you get with platin real money is getting weapons & warframes classes faster dekorationsmore stuff to customize and buying slots for more items and even then you can buy platin from other players if you have rare items in most cases prime items from the void as i said you can get almost everything for free in terms of money if you try to get platinum for free prepare to invest alot of time you want platinum but have no way of buying it or want to trade with players even then you still have 2 ways of gaining it are you creative check the forums and see if a community event is running the winners not just 1st place gain some platin and the top 3 winner are depending on the contest either get thier idea fanart or voice added to the game or are presented in the livestream you arent very creative well then watch the live stream you can watch a video right because you can get 1000 platinum around 50 bucks just for watching the thier twitchstream that is if you are one of the 3 lucky people sometimes 4 who get choosen but hey free money buliding weapons and stuff can take up from 12 to 24 hours and buliding warframes can take up to 3 days and while the game can get repetitive the devs are constantly adding new and fun stuff to the game and include events where you can win special weapons and items that you in most cases will only be able to get trough the event you should give the game a try it is at least for the first hours alot of fun also the devs are fing awesome
recommended
been playing this since beta days and discovered it from polycount forums when theyd announce their project and immediately download and play if you like fast paced scifi ninja then this is for you and i recommended it warning you will get addicted to it and its a grindfest but not that too much grind like korean mmos newbies can easily pick the gameplay and it has a new tutorial for newbies they keep updating the game and add new warframe maps game modes and weapons so youll never be bored
recommended
the game is in awsomesimple as that

what is warframe introduction warframe is a freetoplay third person shooter scifi game with some sort of an alien theme incorporated into itthis game has one of the best variety of content even in comparison to some other games some that arent even f2ps well what do i exactly mean by that lets find out likes it has a large selection of warframes to choose from warframes are exoskeleton suits that grants the user four different skills to choose from each warframe has its own unique abilities however  dont let that fool you as for the fact that the skill mechanics might seem a little similar skills are of course extremely satisfying to play around with unique & distinctive weapons options with a huge arsenal at your disposal the weapons in this game will definitely provide an endless amount of fun the movement mechanic in warframe is also very special and distinctive any player is able to perform acrobatic feats traveling from room to room in mere seconds dislikes unfortunately the developers of warframe seem to have quite some pricy microtransaction schemes in mind though some people might not agree that this is a pay to win title an undeniable fact is that warframe indirectly forces the player to purchase credits or otherwise known as platinum in order to have a much enjoyable experience based on the fact that a player starts off with 2 warframe slots out of a total of 24 warframes and a couple of weapon slots ridiculous weapon customization options weapons and warframes in the game are enhanced in many different ways with the use of modification cards these cards take up points and the game only allows up to 60 points to be expendable on a single warframeweapon well itll be 30 if you dont have at least 20 platinum missions in warframes are reptitive and downright distasteful unfortunately its either going around killing everyone in the house saving a hostage or defending a stationary artifact conclusion all in all warframe is a great coop game it will be right up your alley if you are looking for a third person shooter fastpaced and adrenaline style fun however if you dont like microtransactions meaning that you dont wish to spend any money on digital ingame items & repetitive content then id suggest you steer clear away from this game & dont even think of touching it with a ten foot pole verdict 710 a good coop shooter that can be enjoyed by all a cautious recommendation because of microtransaction features in it
recommended
depite this game being a little grindy and p2p if you are into these games it makes it super fun even if you are playing with friends the thing that makes this game the best f2p shooter is the constsntly online working devs they are always giving things out to the public and having devstreams talking about the next updates and they give this game a major update every month or so if you are thinking about getting this game then get it you have nothing to lose apart from maybe the hours of grinding
recommended
quite possibly the best f2p game to date theres always a goal within reach in this game whether it be that next new weapon or warframe or ranking up old favorites or events that add cool new content sometimes those goals take awhile but i cant really call it a grind is it really grinding if the gameplay is satisfyingly fun even without the reward at the end

warframe is really freaking fun imagine a good 4player coop game like left 4 dead now make it 3rd person and add in a whole load more weapons from magnums to assault rifles to boomerangs with spikes and give those weapons a levelling option so you can add in extra traits like elemental damage increased ammor or fire rate or scenery penetration then to finish off instead of redneck hicks or token female college students make the player a magical cyberninja in space gameplay is fast and slick and your warframe is very responsive the core game is a huge amount of hackyslashy fun especially with friends you can play solo and thats enjoyable enough now and then but the game adds in more and tougher enemies the more players there are much like diablo 2 did you can choose one of three warframes at the beginning but there are another ten to collect which is mostly a matter of completing assassination missions that reward you with the requisite parts you can spend real world money if you like but its genuinely fun to run the same mission a couple of times because the action is pretty intense and the levels are randomly generated so surprises do happen play warframe its very enjoyable and its free what more could you want
recommended
1010 but why is my thing loading so long for meta update
recommended
why ninja neeed ele 9991000
recommended
at many times will it be an absoulute grindfest but the community is far from toxicie very helpful and positive and the gameplay is very fun weapons range from bows to kunai to a giant greatsword 810
recommended
best pay to win ever made it gets really envolving afther you learn about the lore and it actually gets preety adicting one bad thing about it its that the multiplayer has way too much problems ing strict nat but if you solve that problem youre really good to go
recommended
this is a great game and its free the only negative thing is that it can get a little bit repetitive and a bit glitchy the thing i love about this game aswell is that you dont need a good connection to play it in coop which is great for me i would recommend playing coop after the first few mssions as it gets pretty hard after that
recommended
one of the most fun and addictive games ever
recommended
fun fast free great for playing half an hour per day oneofakind beautiful character and level design
recommended
after playing this game for a few hours now i highly recommend you play it hours of gameplay which im still farming for things its not p2w but in some aspects it is only having 2 warframe slots out of the 30 but still 1010 from me
recommended
played this in closed beta thinking of coming back the time i spend with this game was a good time a really good time then the inventory system changed alot and i just couldnt understand it so i left the combat is alot of fun and most of the time pretty easy the best thing however are the ninja skillsparkour tricks you can pull of like wallrunning and at the same time shoot someones head off pure awesomeness i also like the small cinematic scenes at the beginning and the end of a mission 3
recommended
free to play pretty interesting at the beginning but requires a lot of grinding if you dont want to pay for it i would recommend it  you can spend a couple of evening having fun but dont expect staying there for too long
recommended
the game its self is a fine game to me the combat system is good and it runs smoothly the only thing that gets me is that you need platinum to get pretty much everything from wepons to other characters
recommended
try this game and stick with it for 12 weeks before deciding if you like the game i really do like this game the graphics are awesome the gameplay fast furious and wrapped in good artistic style and the gore isjolly good highly recommended if you like coop game and or action game the only gripe is platinums are a bit overpriced though redeemingly you do not need themt to craft anything in game except to buy slots for your weapons and warframesarmored suits
recommended
amazing game tons of replay value outstanding end game content the game kinda lacks customization but the story makes up for it 100%
recommended
this game is about friendship you play as a man in a suit made from materials and use your void powers to fight mutated space bunnies people from star trek and the zerg swarm 1010 you can get a bow and pin people to stuff
recommended
the best free to play on steam get it play it  
recommended
may seem like its a pay to win game at first but when you start to play you relize its not its very good game
recommended
overall a great game good character choice with plent of upgrades
recommended
ignore metacritic this is a fun game if you dont mind a little bit of work to get into it
recommended
i stick potatoes on my guns
recommended
best free to play game in awhile most free to pay are freemium wear cash can make overly powered but this not the case with warframe there is in store cash only items but most weapons and warframes can be got with simply time and effort combine with combat composed both mele and ranged it makes for a fairly enetetaining mmo
recommended
good game a bit slow in the lower levels but stick with it  and for all the new players out there i got one word for you soma
recommended
freaking awsome game 1010 will lose my life to this game
recommended
first off i would like to say that this game is super adictive and fun secondly if you do play this game or want to start playing the game id suggest you look at a few tips and tricks to increase your productivity ten fold for starters i suggest you get excalibur because its the most balanced and easiest warframe to learn how to play top tip you just have to get rhino that warframe just wrecks everything in the way overall i do enjoy the game and i would highly recommend it to anyone that likes 3rd person shoot and kill everything in you way with 3 other friends yeah
recommended
look ill be honest  at the start i had some doubt about this game oh dude a 3rd person shooter where you grind for stuff but hey it was free i had time never even looked back digital extremes has crafted one of the best games ive ever played and everything is free can you imagine a f2p game that isnt p2w hard to yes but warframe does it perfectly not only that de keeps on improving and supporting their game with help from player input oh and did i mention the space ninjas no well go play warframe and see em for yourself
recommended
i love this it is one of my favorites at the moment
recommended
nothing like warframe in the market its the best shooter for me the coop nature of the game keeps the community friendly and stress free keeps me coming back for more
recommended
i really enjoy this game especially when its played with friends there is one thing i dont really enjoy and thats the thousands of hours grinding for materials for a weapon\warframe most of the weapons are single blueprints and take about 12 hours to make but each part of the warframe blueprint has a seperate blueprint for eg rhino consists of rhino helmet rhino systems and rhino chassis every single part is a different blueprint and takes another 12 hours to make if you cant afford to buy platinum it usually takes about 1015 days of grinding for the materials for every different blueprint doing the math its 240 hours  36 hours  the extra 72 hours to complete the warframe it takes simply 348 hours 14 and a half days to make a single warframe but i still recommend the game but if you dont spend a little money on buying platinum you wont get very far very fast
recommended
its a pretty fun game apart from the grinding everything is makeable with credits and trading mods for plat is always a way to make some plat i would rate it 810 l0l ya nan
recommended
ok so you are looking for a new game to play maybe you like league of legends mass effect hitman or halo well this one is not anything like one of theseit is all  combine any 3rd person shooter mmorpg with scifi magic  you can imagine this is what you get tons and tons of new weapons every patch new warframe character in every second patch new mission and rewards everyday alert missions every hour  missions with rare gear  tons of player ready to help newbies ingame huge trade channels and web sites and the best freetoplay game there isanywhere  perslonaly i played it more than 400h in last year and since the start it has changed alot community has gone boooom over the internet and  well just look at all the artwork  so what are you waiting for
recommended
pure awesomeness
recommended
i quit playing this game back in early beta it got very grindy they have changed all of this fun game again super easy to get into with friends but deep and complicated towards the end so you have something to work for and not get bored really fun coop shooter and tons of stuff to keep you entertained and busy 
recommended
you play as a space ninja fighting genetically engineered power armoured warriors robots and bioweapons in the grim distant future warhammer 40k meets hack and slash ninjas so much yes
recommended
brilliant game to play with your mates or in solo would reccommend this game to anyone who likes futuristic sword and gun games with a hint of puzzle solving 1010
recommended
one of the most free to play games with no real p2w while u can buy every piece of equipment for real money u can also find and craft them that doesnt take that long game play smooth as butter as long as u have a good host or play solo  the weapons are varied and characters are mostly well balanced there is no real pvpthere are duels in dojos and 2v2s in conclaves that have a gearscore range but no rewards while the game has a few bugs here and there its pretty damn polished for a beta and it has bows bows are great 910 needs more bows
recommended
if you like space shooting x melee % killing allot  a really good gamei know that wasnt that great for recommending this game but you should at least try it
recommended
this is the best free to play game ive ever played it has huge updates almost every month and endless content to keep you entertained it has great graphics great gameplay and great multiplayer it also runs good on any computer i would buy this game if it where to cost money
recommended
overall for a new player this is a very good game and i recommend getting it in fact id recommend everyone at least tries it once because it truly is different to any other game out today now i did greatly enjoy this game ive donated quite alot of money during my time playing however this game suffers what many games still do once you have everything you want or are just satisfied with what you have the only reason you play the game is to try look better than your peers [can also be explained in the endless cycle formula grind to get better weapons to grind with those better weapons to grind with those better weapons to get more weapons to grind with to grind to get better weapons loop here  insanity] it basically becomes a great big  contest between the pros including endless hours of grinding for weapons that the other players dont have yet the weapon is most likely not even worth the grind yes i admit this game is still in developement however i am just prewarning this game is yet to offer a great amount for the goodold players as for actuall gameplay id give it a 910 fun factor 910 but decreases overtime unless you dont mind grinding as an added bonus id like to praise the technical support team they are the nicest and most helpful support ive ever encountered <3 you warframe even if you annoy me
recommended
i want this game to bear my children its very loving gives me stuff for free and supplies me with happiness oh and blood and ninja cyborg assassins and does what i tell it to what more could you want from a wif i mean game did i mention it contains ninja cyborg assassins because it does and theyre awesome this game is easily a tenno of ten
recommended
quite the grind but loads of fun through the end

a really great third person shooter game

recommended
fast pased action game with good gun play and magnificent melee
recommended
this game is pretty awsome pretty fast paced and lost of different game senerios to play with recent updates it has gotten even better
recommended
dont get me wrong this game is a great f2p with friends and such but if you are playing this game without microtransactions the game should be renamed grinding and paywalls the videogame
recommended
all and all great game cant say its perfect but it will keep you occupied for a long time the combat is fun fast paced even if some of the enemy mechanics are often a bit cheap and feels rather rewarding at most times there is a light grind wall but all the objects in the game other than cosmetics can be obtained without any real money so with a good time investment anything can be obtained even cash shop items highly recommend it as the game is constantly improoving and more content is added just a small advice find someone else to play with as that will make the experience much better
recommended
back in april 2013 when i first played this game upon initial open beta status this game was absolute garbage environments were almost totally dark textures were crap ai and physics were very subpar no minimap or objective markers and the list went on however its now july and a friend got me to give the game another shot there have been massive improvements and i really think they initially made it open beta too early theyve likely lost a lot of potential players due to bad reviews and bad experiences but give this game a shot as long as you have friends to play with this game will provide hours of group fun even when doing something as mundane as farming materials for crafting items i think warframes devs have made a lot of improvements and more are coming this game is gong to be around a long time additions 62114 so the game has continually been updated things like damage 20 melee 20 new weapons and warframescharacters the game has some issues still and certain changes theyve made recently that i dont care for but and this is a big buthaha this game has something truly unique devs that for the most part listen to their players even if they dont actually make changes or additions suggested they do read them when things have been added to the game the community hates dedigital extremes will jump up to fix them they understand we keep them going they dont take us for granted theyre adding in new enemies and weapons that players have suggested and provided concept art for too theyre even adding in a new player experience in a couple of weeks with update 14 along with an actual pet system as in we get a space dog and have to actually take care of it its not just an extra piece of equipment but a companion all in all while some mistakes get made or bugs happen thosere bound to happen we still are lucky enough to have a developer that actually cares what its players think of their game

i think this game is good
recommended
pure awesomeness this is the most enjoyable game ive played because i always come back to it i think it has to be the most beautiful freetoplay game at the moment and it probably will stll be so for a while
recommended
let me start off by saying this game is addicting it is not only an exemplary example of a third person actionshooter but of a game utilizing a f2p model digital extremes has done a wonderful job ensuring balance across the board whether its between the creditsplatinum or between the weapons and warframes themselves in addition they have written a narrative that is dare i say it relatively fresh and original while simultaneously tying in dark sector for which this game is a spiritual successor to i am genuinely excited to see where warframes story and digital extremes shall take fans of this game next
recommended
great graphics awesome gameplay a very enjoyable game which is easy to play
recommended
this game is very worth a play not pay to win which is a nice change for a free to play
recommended
one of the best ftp games ive ever played

a great thirdperson scifi shooter game you can play stealthily or just run and gun if you like shooting games with fast a flashy combat then this game is for you and its free so why not give it a try
recommended
shot man was fun
recommended
i think i play this game too much other than the few bugs that obviously need work the archwing missions mostly and a few small things this game is amazing you start out with one of three warframes which are all great frames and you start playing through the game with a very helpful tutorial ranking up pretty quickly you have the option to purchase new frames and weapons with real money but you really dont need to as all of the bosses drop parts to new frames and weapon blueprints drop like crazy you have the option to build all of the warframes via blueprints purchased in the games market with game credits not real money and the original frames can be researched in the new clan dojos that they introduced into the game join a clan or make your own which is super easy and decorate it like crazy with stuff that drops throughout the game when i originally started playing this game it only had three maps and two bad guy races to fight against they have since added multiple planets with random and very different maps a new faction of bad guys that are incredibly creepy and you can join syndicates for added bonuses for your frames and be attacked during missions by rival syndicates and one creepy guy thats really upset that you keep killing bosses oh and now they added pets that will fight at your side overall this game is intense beautiful and best played with friends or random people on the internet
recommended
my jugment might be  but i do recomened playing with friends if you want to do muliplayer because they will listin to what you say and the game is kinda about stealth because stealth is the most fun you will have but that dosent mean the action is terrible its just youll have a better time hideing  well for me anyways the game is good and i havent went threw most of it but i still recmoned it becuase you can still play without spending a penny and have fun so i say play to your hearts cantent and if im wrong and the game is actuly  and cheap then tell me im not the brightist when trying to state my opione on a game click that download butten and have a blast

this a a grinding f2p not a p2w type lots of resources to make weapons needed only thing one would need to buy would be cosmetics everything else is obtainable ingame some weapons that are among the best are clanexclusive weapons which are easy to obtain just go into the recruiting tab and ask for a clan best f2p model i have seen so far great graphics 3rd person shootingslashing and weekly updates that show that the developement team is passionate about this game and see it less as a money maker and more of a personal project develpers are active in the community always giving personal feedback to posts made at the warframe website all in all a 89 out of 10

over 700 hours played uuuh guess i like it best way i can describe this game is borderlands 2 mixed with hellgate london in space with eveonline progression 4 person coop over the shoulder shooter with ninja jumps wall running sliding flip kick hammer attacks bows shotguns assault rifles and each frame has 4 abilitys invisibilityaoe healaoe disarmaoe stunchargeknockdownaoe deathmelee attack boostdotsteleportsdeployable shields the game exists in the perma open beta like dungeon defenders did for 2 years and like every game released now does so they have the excuse hey its only beta for comicall game inballance and garbage skills its totally free to play and you can acsess all content totally free but it will take you a few months there are currently 13 warframes to unlock and 31 weapons you can unlock them by farming the bluprints farming materials and spending 34 days crafting or spending 10 pounds for each frame and 39 pounds for weapons you start with a choice of 3 frames a standard frame excalibur with a very powerful aoe melee slide attack and decent aoe then a stealth frame loki that is really good mid and endgame but will struggle early on and a high shield caster frame with more utility that damage mag there are over 100 missions to complete and unlock but mostly they are the same type repeated in a different ship and a couple of them blur into take this here raid  rush in steal somthing spy  steal data from 4 computers around the zone deception  plant a bomb in the ships engines extermination  kill x bad guys defense  defense a podcore against waves and waves of baddies can carry on forever if you choose after 5 waves mobile defense  run about defending multiple points and finally 1 point while a virus is uploaded or a computer is assassination  murder one of the 10 or so big boss mobs in the game and void key missions which follow one of the above formulas in a really pretty zone wth a little puzzle solving since the last few updates there are about 6 new mission types and more planets there are 3 races each with multiple mob types  currently i think the game is hard to get in to you need to get new warframes to experiance alot of the fun your really need to spend at least a little money on a warframe to get you started alot of the fun weapons require mastery which needs a few days to get up your starting weapons are crap and you need to upgrade them fast or you quickly get bored there is also a log of missing in game information you get a screen of 30 weapons wham in the face and all they say is accuracy 10 fire rate 3 damage 40 what they dont say is weapon a has armor ignoor and rapes lines of mobs weapon b has 10 shots in its clip and pisses them out meaning you can only use it as a backup weapon c has a hidden charge attack stat that does 4x more damage wikia helps alot big online commuity turning into guilds and mmo but not needed fun game worth trying and its free it really is unless you want a bright pink sword that will cost you 399 to unlock bright colour pallet i reccoment steams warframe starter pack then watch httpwwwyoutubecomwatchv9fnlhvpbrbm&listplkszomqmo9pd5tdbxabivk9o_ngeu1isl

slicing and dicing your way through hordes of enemies never felt more satisfying i highly recommend this for people who love hack and slash games or people who love strategy and planning this games got plenty of both i think one of the only cons are that if you have an average not for gaming or average laptop computer you might want to go to through the graphics settings and turn off all of the motion blur flashy lights and lens flares

this game is tons of fun the devs obiously listen to their players and the replayablity is good and it has to be considering its kind of a neccesity for the game i mean we ask for trading they give us the trading stand you cant trade weapons or warframes so not exactly what we wanted but hey theyre trying in fact i actually had a friend who didnt like the game because there was no pvp and that was the case for most people they asked for it and they received the fact that the game devs actually try to please their players is what makes me recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about playing the only reason i can see people not liking this game or not playing it is because of the gore in it and i would hardly call it gore i mean there is definatly worse out there also the gore is brought upon by the player not by the game if you dont want gore then dont use a katana so for any parents reading this i wouldnt be too worried about this game for more information on what happens in the game itself look herehttpwwwgameskinnycomlacoqwarframereviewforpc

this game is amazing i have had some much fun playing this game with my friends i wouldnt really recommend it if your playing it by your self but with friends its a very very fun game d

this is an indepth review scroll down to the conclusion if youre short on time or want the bottom line but if you are looking at this game i highly recommend reading all of this introduction warframe is a wonderfully unique and constantly evolving very social freetoplay third person shooter with a focus on cooperative player versus enemy combat nearly every mission is procedurally generated each time you load it and it will be a specified game mode with a set objective there are 4 factions plus a neutral faction mostly composed of fauna to fight against with tons of interesting enemies there many customization options for players there are player skins color palettes with 90 colors each decals bobbleheads helmets and more you can have a hot pink ninja with a moustache movember only and scarf blowing kisses if you so desire it is quite grindcentric but it is excellent at what it does the grind is a design choice and not a symptom of not having enough game content so dont be scared off by that the business model for microtransactions is very fair purchasing weapons will generally not give you a signifcant advantage outside of some timesaving there is no paytowin here what you get for purchasing the premium currency with real money is the ability to skip some of the grind or random elements cosmetic items and likely the most important are item slots you only have a tiny number of slots to begin with and you will need to sell your old gear to acquire new gear or get platinum to buy slots possible to sell rare items without paying a penny you are also given some platinum to start with you can obtain almost 100% of the gameplay content without paying a dime but if you get hooked on this game fair warning you will probably want to spend some cash im not rich by any means whatsoever but ive spent a large percentage of my average entertainment budget on this game and i look back with no regrets to get the same amount of entertainment out of going to the movies as i have gotten playing this game i would have to spend around $750010000 usd the bottom line in warframe is that you will be progressing at your desired pace and with your own goal which may be one of the following do i want to complete every mission do i want to be the best pvper do i want to acquire every weapon in the game do i want to break the weekly record in survivaldefense modes do i want to piece together the game lore and write my own story do i want to find a tightknit community and help construct an amazing clan hangout with tech research obstacle courses statues displaying clan achievements literal zen gardens and more do i want to acquire every one of the hundreds of mods more or less lootable trading cards you jam in your gear to change your ability range gun damage fire rate move speed knockdown resistance slide distance wall run cost and much more the choice is yours in warframe the developers are also extremely involved with the community if a change goes out that the whole community dislikes even if the developers still think the revision is correct they will listen to the players and change it anyway and roll back the change within 24 hours sometimes they have contests q&as devstreams and more there are global operations that take place every few weeks that reward players with exclusive items for things such as sabotaging a mobilizing space army or preventing a faction from discovering something that would make them too strong they really stay in touch with fans on a personal level the hotfixes are announced in realtime ingame by the enigmatic and hysterical redtext whose dialogue makes you feel like youre a personal friend of the developers never have i seen a developer care more about their game and the players i started playing roughly a year and a half ago after update 7 the game had maybe 30 weapons total all of them being this weapon shoots more bullets faster than this weapon and has a bigger clip size on basically one tile set the game is now on update 152 and has 13 beautiful and varied tilesets weapons ranging from rocket launchers to poison cloud launchers to chemical acidthrowers to freezerays and a massive oversized heman sword is it for me if youre a casual gamer you dont have to grind much and you can mostly flow through the missions and play with your buddies and just take it easy if youd like there are lots of newplayerfriendly tutorials and explanations that have been added that make it easier if youre a hardcore gamer there is plenty to offer if you dont mind a selfdirected grind as of this writing there are 178 weapons 28 warframes 11 companions 253 mission nodes 428 mods and more with content added almost each week once you rank an item up to the max level 30 you can use forma to improve your item and reset it to rank 0 to repeat the process with this system you can endlessly improve upon your weapons and warframes as much as you wish and do harder and harder content and do longer survivals and defenses there is more to do but ive covered the big goals here conclusion warframe is one of my personal favorite games i very highly reccomend it if you can tolerate some repetition and you like fun action games positive fresh concepts space ninjas with an easternstyle code of honor serve the mysterious lotus the player is intended to drive their own story some decisions can be made to shape this fun fluid gameplay that never gets boring there are playstyles to suit every player and many maneuvers such as wallrunning flipping rolling blocking counterattacking and sliding massive amount of warframes weapons mods and missions to keep you busy for hundreds of hours incredibly involved developer that addresses community concerns and improves the game weekly fair microtransactions no paytowin cooperative mostly friendly community as with every game there are some jerkstrolls wellexecuted clan system that lets you construct a central hub and hangout for you and your friends negative most items are built through accumulating the same dozen or so materials after mission progression ends this process becomes repetetive some items require repeating the same mission type over and over to get a certain weapon piece as a reward a small amount of weapons and one warframe are acquirable only through randomly generated onehour alert missions this can be frustrating if an alert you need occurs while you are asleep global operations are timesensitive so if you go on vacation or cant log on for some time there is a chance you may miss an operation with an exclusive item for the reward there are several eventexclusive items that will never be available again this may bother some perfectionists very difficult to acquire cosmetic customizations and item slots without paying money many minor bugs and many bugfixes result in a game of whackamole an incomplete plot makes it so theres no compelling goal yet but plot is being added in chunks slowly multiplayer is peertopeer and the network code is a bit buggy which often means slightlytomoderately laggy games endgame for veterans currently  in general amounts to collecting warframes and weapons and making your gear stronger this will likely change in the future playeraligned factions have recently been added to help with this that provide rewards only available for siding with that syndicate and earning experience while having their sigil equipped

warframe is a refreshing blend of fps rpglike progression and mmo interactivity my average warframe session plays as follows the game opens up to an overlay of the solar system the options from here are fairly analogous to that of diablo iii from here you have access to your equipment inventory crafting market with both ingame and out of game currency items clan chat and friends list unique to warframe is the solar map it features high interactivity allowing you to drill down two levels of detail selecting a planetplanetoid allows you to see all available mission in that system upon hovering on a mission the map shows the mission type faction and level of difficulty presented in the mission there are various ways to run missions but the most commonly used is online in this mode you matchmake with other players wanting to run the same mission once matchmaking begins you can either select play now to begin the mission after a short countdown or simply wait for at least one other person to join before the countdown begins automatically if you are running though a mission and its not yet full4 players max and the objective is still incomplete players will be able to drop in midmission the more players working together the higher the experience and reward payout progression in warfame is accomplished through a couple different systems your account has a rank it begins at 1 and slowly builds up as you play through the game progressing to the next rank requires completing a trial accessed by clicking on the xp bar on the main menu once its full and flashing certain weapons require a certain account rank or mastery rank your warframe weapons and carrier has a level these cap at 30 as these are raised your health shields stamina engery and damage increase each level provides the respective equipment an additional amount of capacity for mods each new weapon and new warframe that you level helps build your mastery and is proven to be the quickest way to progress each mod drains capacity but gives an upgrade these are both increased my fusing the mod to higher levels this offers near limitless upgradeability to your frame and weapons of choice as you progress though the games content you will collect more mods along the way allowing you to further customize your build to your needs chasing difficult to find mods and upgrading them to their full potential is a challenge in and of itself

its hard to find a middle ground when it comes to would you recommend or would you not recommend the game is good ill give it that played it for quite a bit 40 hours before relizing it was on steam and swapped to that for achievementsitems the game looks great the gameplay is fun and the new content is always nice and i have to say i love the dojo being allowed to build stuff your way in a game is always amazing but at the same time there are some key flaws so lets do pros and cons pros good graphics a lot of different warframes and weapons to play around with you are essentially cyborg ninja from metal gear solid fully customizable and decoratable clan dojo eitheror it takes places in the same universe as dark sector which is weird never did like dark sector cons rather then list the cons by just simplifying it ill explain a few for starters you have endgame all games needs a good endgame but warframe sadly does what diablo 2 did you can become powerful enough to kill the hardest boss in twenty seconds now grindfarm so you can kill him in fifteen seconds now grindfarm some more so you can kill him in ten seconds now grindfarm some more so you can 1shot the final boss youll just be trying to make yourself godly powerful in which case any new content that is released as well as any current mission will lose all challenge and it will begin to feel like a chore doing missions to the point you just run through all enemies spamming aoe skills just to get to the end the missions as well are grindlike since on some event missions you have to replay the same mission five times just to get the reward the grind does however feel a lot less when you work in a clan all working toward a single goal like finishing a dojo decoarion the warframes while varied have some things to be desired as expected there are those select warframes everyone wants or is used for endgame content the rhino warframe can be aquired on the second planet venus and you can pretty much go the whole game using that one warframe without ever choosing another thats what i did stomp  iron skin ftw i ended up getting other warframes nekros paladin berserker excalibur but i never had the motivation to even play them sure i could play the level 4 nekros there oooorrr play the lvl 30 fully decked out rhino and not feel like a third wheel in invasion modes in comparison to the others the last big flaw is story to this day i still have no clue what is going on like i know im tenno i know the corpus and grineer are badguys but not always or something cause you will help them at times and i know you work for a girl named lotus who might be a tenno but might not be who wants you to do stuff for reasons nothing is really explained ever ever ive tried looking it up the grineer are simply explained as they live on a rotten earth theyre clones they use old tech their mission stop the tenno from awakening because eeehhhh you know people are fighting but what are they fighting for is never really explained the most i got was the grineer are trying to conquer everything stop them from doing that the corpus are trying to do stuff too stop them from doing that theres a guy named stalker too who comes after you he might be a tenno stop him from stopping you stop others im still gonna recommend the game its fun to play for a while i would not suggest trying to play this for so long you become supahawesome numbah one this kind of game is a space filler something to play between waiting for other games to come out like titanfall or dark souls 2 or elder scrolls online that sort of thing in conclusion fun gameplay good graphics and a heavilly customizable clan dojo but a grind with no real story backing it up wouldnt recommend spending 100 hours on it and stealth becomes quite pointless once you can stomp and kill every enemy in the current room and next couple adjascent rooms die instantly

this is one of the better freeto_play games out there it takes a few hours for it to get fun but once you get into it its tough to put down it isnt as grindintesive as most f2p games either if you dont want buy anything highly recommended especially if you have friends to play with

warframe is an amazing game its a third person coop scifi shooter space ninja extravaganza its a little slow starting out if you have the money i recommend getting affinity and credit boosters but once you get past the first planet or two you really start to have some great fun with a good team and communication this game offers hours of never ending entertainment each warframe playable character offers its own unique play and fighting style with currently 16 warframes and 3 prime variants the 4th excalibur prime is no longer attainable over 100 primary secondary and melee weapons and 5 sentinels robotic companions this game has massive replayability the very best part is its free so why not try it out ps dont stop after the first couple missions i promise youll find its an amazing game

a very enjoyable fastpaced shooter when played with others with the option of stealthy slow solo play as well some repetitive maps and scenarios but still with enough variation to not feel grindy until youre trying to get something specific to drop can be played entirely free but a little cash injection certainly can boost the fun
recommended
it is a action game with a realistic engineboth graphically and combatwisewith lots of hacknslash resembling devilmaycry 4 with more space ninjasit is perfect but for the lack of stealthbut hellits perfect editnow with the new gui and the new stuff from the mad cephalon onwards the game is imho terriblei just dont know what to do in it anymorefor veterans< dont come back for new players<play it you might understand something from it

warframe is a tactical third person shooter set in a vast and continually expanding universe that is very interesting if you look into its lore the game is set on your character an old tenno warrior who is in an massive suit of armour called a warframe a warframe is a suit of armour that was placed onto a tenno when they are initaited and has 4 special abilities and a wide array of advantages such as better shields or armour you a lone tenno was put into cyrosleep after a great war beetween the sentients and the as i call them the orokin people you wake up centuries later to a unverse filled with corruption greed and violence and it is up to you and your fellow tenno to restore peace once more to the solar system gameplay wise the game is built around you doing acrobatics and maneuvers to outsmart your enemies such as running across a wall to reach an enemy with your shotgun as you progress through the game youll find things called mods these mods are used to augment your warframe and weapons to certain advantages one example of this is to give a rocket launcher a faster fire rate or a shotgun more accuracy whilst the mods do little to improve your items when you first get them you can upgrade them with fusion cores or with other duplicates of mods you can say get a damage mod from the basic %20 increase to a phenominal %200 increase on the max rank this system works beutifully and works well with the whole concept of you being your own unique character the classes in his game are set in what type of warframe you have there are over 20 warframes currently in the game the most recent being mesa and with each one comes a different experience your warframe is unique with the abilities and attributes it has one example is the warframe rhino a beast of a warframe that has high armour shields and health and a powerful array of abilites that revolve around either taking or dealing damage each of your warframes comes with 4 revive tokens which replenish every day to the maximun of 4 this is very useful as solo players will find killing enemies difficult on higher levels apart from your warframe you will have access to a wide array of primary secondry and melee weapons each catagory has a subclass which include handcannons staffs longswords rifles and many more some of these subclasess require different types of mods such as a well modded rifle set will not work on a shotgun as they are two different weapons types same as your warframe you can mod your weapons with a wide array of mods that include increasing damage to mods that inflict elemental damage or status effects there is alot of things that i can talk about but there is just too much to fit in a review this game is free and does not force you to pay and it is fairly easy to farm for resouces and build that all important weapon youve been wanting this feels satisfying and well achieved and one of the many reasons why a have played warframe for over a year yes i realise it says i have less than an hour of gametime but i have over 1000 hours on the browser version of the game i give this game a 455 a very well earned score keep up the great work de d

after playing it for 145 hours i can say that it was really worth my time so far i dont know why the metacritic score is pretty low but its probably because the reviews were from back when the game was well not so interesting its a third person shooter with parkourelements filled with missions around defending assassinating a boss exterminating a level and so on there is a gigantic list of weapons all of them can be further be changed in appearance while mods will change how they behave a flamethrower can turn into a gasthrower heavy melee weapons can turn into fast weapons of destruction there are also different warframes  pretty much classes in other games each warframe has 4 skills most of them very useful others very situational weapons and warframes can either be crafted via ingame money and resources or bought with real money crafting will also take real time to complete from half a day with most weapons to 3 days when finalizing a new warframe its clearly a way to get you to buy stuff but as soon as you have some missions under your belt the waiting time isnt really that annoying just as a warning the game isnt easy at the beginning you will die often and hard but after that initial hurdle the game gets really good my only problems so far are the high prices of some things you can buy and that there are only 4 enemy factions so far you should check it out if you like third person shooters you should also check it out if you liked borderlands as it is somewhat like that with leveling up and modifying weapons it is free 2 play but you wont get slapped with a paywall until youre like 20 hours into the game and by that you will probably know if you want to play on or not
recommended
very awesome game although i play this pretty much on the ps4
recommended
the game is awesome and pretty much fun but just one recomendation they give you 50 platinum purchasable currency to use in what you want only use it on slots for your warframe or weapons it is wasted on resources edit okay i gotta edit this review for plenty of reason 1 i have sunk way too many hours into this game i am serious over 300 hours 2 this game has become something of a wonder its mechanics are good it looks good and the developers are we tied with the community 3 the game is just incredible really annoyingly grindy bit of a platinum  and they give you way too little warframe slots for 20 plats but if you get beyond that the game just takes over and you both learn to love eachother
recommended
very fun game can get very addictive kinda a pay to win but at the same time anything u can buy with plat you can earn through missions except some mods ex primed chamber

i have been playing this game since its release and put it on my steam account when it was released on steam i love this game and you should too the development team digital extremes listens to the players or at least the ones within reason as well as hold biweekly devstreams and other various fun with the community to let them know what is going on pros  graphics sound design is nice always evolving each week is new content hardly ever missed business model is fantastic shortcuts and skinsaccessories only tons of content warframes enemies modes quests weapons and events ai is fairly scaled depending on level  mission type community is polite and far beyond what many other games have cons grinding only to some is that a problem or turnoff sometimes is buggy due to patches is usually quickly resolved within hours of patch tho semi learning curve twards mid levels 20s30s ish sidenote you can not as of me writing this get warframe or weapon slots without gaining platinum or events by buying their premium currency &or selling rare parts to other players for said currency i highly recommend this game digitalextremes is great and deserves you to at least try it warframe is a even better experiance with friends so be sure to bring some

i wasnt expecting much of warframe when first graced my desktop but within the first three weeks i played i was pleasently impressed i could say that back when the founder packs were still available i could see the potential within the title for something great which got me to buy into the whole game to show my support how it has evolved over the course of nearly two years of play hasnt always lived up to the expectations i had set but it was still worth the time and effort i had initially put in warframe has always been supurb and seeing how it has evolved from a simple thirdperson action shooter into something greater is something to behold i hope the next update continues to improve the game and provide enjoyment for years to come

the game is basically a constant grind but the updates have been exciting its free so you can see if its your cup of joe as for me i rarely feel like playing this because none of the levels feel truly unique except for their asthetics the arch wing fixed that and i hope to see more of these game changing updates in the future
recommended
good game  enjoy it very much
recommended
this is an awesome game and its ing free in my opinion this is by far the best free to play experience ive had the pleasure of gracing essentially you can get everything in game without spending a penny of real dosh the gameplay itself is very free flowing smooth and lets you do a lot more like climb the environment do parkour crouch or slide around the map overall its a unique and fun game to play that bears resemblance to mass effect this game is still in beta and has a lot more potential that it can muster up in my opinion 810

ever had a sudden need to play as a bunch of space ninjas who put on powered armor and use blades and guns to restore balance to the solar system while that is a bit of a specific need then warframe is for you i mean youre able to pull off all kinds of awesome moves and abilities to defeat hordes of enemies that want to have your head on a platter sliding on the ground before swinging your melee weapon and slicing enemies to bits running on walls while simultaneously firing your guns you name it there are a variety of game modes to keep things fresh in one sector youll be defending something vital to your cause in the next youll be fighting to survive by keeping your life support at a manageable level also the developers listen to the community and regularly put out updates big and small for example three of the latest big updates have introduced an overhauled melee system player ships and kubrow companions and technological wings that allow you to fly through space shooting at or slashing through anything that stands in your way plus while you can purchase platinum to get weapons warframes and other things most of them you can get for absolutely nothing as long as youre patient and willing to work for them the game is currently in open beta but its still got quite a lot of stuff if youre willing to become a tenno then i recommend you pick warframe up now if youve considered it but ultimately decided to avoid it because of certain issues give it another look anyway the game has likely changed a lot and itll continue to do so for some time
recommended
was expecting something different but was convinced to get this game and i was very impressed by it i really enjoy it great 3 person shooter has decent variety in missions recent updates significantly improved on many things it does have its microtransactions and getting the resources to build weapons and warframes can feel tedious at times but its still fun to play especially with friends

you play as an alien ninja samurai parkour robot with numberous choices in melee primary and secondary weaponary like all f2p games though you can buy pretty much anything with real money and if you do you will be heaps better then the other noob that just started playing who has to grind heaps to actually get something really good its still a great game though and it really is the skill not what weapons someone has that makes a player good at this game you most likely will enjoy it and its free and it has fairly good graphics and you are an alian ninja samurai parkour robot

warframe if youd like to waste a lot of hours and days passing away almost instantly because youre looting those mods want to slice those grineer and corpus soldiers and make infested into green goo you might actually like warframe probably more than like its amazing to play and im not the type to actually play f2p games but warframe hits the spot and you can get over 100% accuracy too

great example of a game that can be enjoyed without paying to play the game is dynamic as it offers randomized levels that manage to keep the trek onto new sectors of the map fresh and entertaining tile sets are gorgeous and most of this game offers bountiful eye candy at seemingly every turn combat is easy to enjoy and often becomes more enjoyable as the player comes to be comfortable with the abilities and manuevers of his warframe often allowing the scaling up of enemy difficulty to feel much more natural than some games ai however is not the greatest and enemies will often fall right into your guns barrel or give enough seconds pause before melee or performing actions to get a blade between them and their consciousness as well this game is very hard to enjoy without friends as online players rarely communicate and either die resetting the level take a majority of the kills luckily loot is spawned uniquely for each player in the level so there is no worry about ninja looters or simply just leech xp while possibly introducing horrific lag or other internet issues nonetheless this game makes up for its flaws such as a seriously incomplete stealth mechanic at the time of even editting this by revamping the classic kill and clear dungeon coop stress the coop requirement experience with a fun item leveling system enjoyable combat beautiful outdoor maps when you get them well made boss fights and the grinding for their loot and the thrill of cutting through 6 heavily armor plated soldiers in one swing with your shiny excalibur warframe play it if you got time to spend with little to no money to spend but you want to make sure its spent having fun running around with your friends in some very memorable thirdperson highintensity fps moments

is fun

easily one of my favourite freetoplays due to the nature of the ingame purchases and how much fun it is to grind levelsgear i actually cant think of another ftp game that is fun to grind runescape was probably only the other fun game going back to its classic days but even that has basically become paytoplay disregarding the fact that they still advertise it as a ftp game you can aquire anything in the game without real world money and it isnt ludicriously hard like it is in competitor games furthermore your far better to spend your money on additional warframe characterssuits and weapon slots as initially you are pretty strapped for space however by the time you reach these limits you will know if your money is worth it keep it mind however that the slots are incredibly cheap aswell for 2 weapon slots sell at at 12p p is platinum the ingame premium currency and 1 warframe slot a tad more expensive at 20p definately give this game a try if you havent already it wont cost you a cent  literally

the graphics are intense as well as the gameplay also this game is revolved around a vast universe where you can switch between characters as well as different traverse planets i highly recommend this game unless you arent much of a hardcoreparkour nonstop revolving action

warframe is a futuristic dungeon crawler filled with microtransactions it is free to download and play and offers you and your friends plenty of coop hours before becoming tedious while the different warframe suits classes that you can choose from play differently and feel different enough to provide you with reasons to explore them the game itself with its monotone design ends up becoming shallow and repetitive with that said you cannot argue against free and coop in the same sentence download if you want a free coop game to enjoy with friends dont download if thirdperson shooter coop or microtransactions arent your cup of tea

this is awesome its like a proper retail game for free it has a mix of gun and sword play its fast combat doesnt really require much you can tackle the compaign on single player or coop

holy cow why didnt i start playing this sooner i heard about this game when it was still in closed beta and thought it had to be stupid i started playing it a little over a month ago and all i can say is wow addicted

one of the best if not even the best free2play game i have ever played no pay to win because mostly its played as a coop game you can get pretty much everything with ingamecash and resources you farm on the different planets buying it with real money is much faster but pretty much unneccesary through daily login presents you can even get a discount price for platinium the cash you gain through real money i recomment playing it with friends on teamspeak its easier and much more fun plus you can talk about how you want to handle the missions rushing through them mostly farming every single piece of sht or going trough stealthy the game gets much attention form the gamemarkers buggfixes can be seen often  in my opinion clearly a 1010 or  d

pretty great and free although there are some annoying limitations that cant be overcame without speding a few bucks but even considering that its a considerably cheap game updated weekly and with something that has been missing in games for a long time clan building you can actually build stuff and design you clan hall the way you want it be it an maze like structure with things thrown around like crazy or a perfectly symmetric beauty its not a fast thing to do but it can be done and it can be done for free with no real money involved the action is great there is a good variety of weapons and framesthe characters you play there is still long way to go and it can only get better start now and do not risk losing alot of nice prizes in the events that are ran at least once a month or so get an invite httpswarframecomsignupreferrerid5154406d1a4d80276800006c my ingame name is xpyder

this is an amazing game i saw this when i was young and i got that face and that feelingthat goooood feelingi eventually forgot about it but then a few faithful months agoduring my last days of grade 6 i found this game again it is free who does not like free games but i did not get it because it was free i am very catious with my choosing of games and a free game id probably pass because usually free games are small boring things or good alphas and betasand this one happened to be a beta when i got it usually when playing a beta i say oh hey look at that thats pretty cool but these things do not look so good and this needs work and but warframe but this was different this was to me no way a beta it had all this and that and those and also these it had swords lasers ninjas multiple male and female characters dismemberment of enemy bodies for when you felt down it had scythes and daggers and hammers and axes it had maps galore it had good textures sentinels and i hpe im not getting ahead of myself but this game is just so amazing and i reccomend this game and everything it stands for 100%

with the fate of your race in the balance it is up to you and the few remaining tenno to push the enemy out of the solar system 810 a lot of fun with friends gets difficult if you try to take on higher levels alone the use of schematics to acquire weapons and warframes makes the feeling of getting new equipment all the more satisfying although if you are not a patient person the ability to purchase the equipment directly through the use of platinum which is purchased with real money can help you get the quick advantage over the enemy

if you are debating wether or not you want to download warframe download it many of my friends tell me its to complicated or its boring i will admit i felt a little overwhelmed at the beginnig but i got over it as everything became understandable along with the awesome people you can meet online i promise you that you will have at least a small bit of fun do i recommend this game yes
recommended
now this game for free is totaly awesome not sure id spend the hudreds that you could to be invinceable but you can progress and rank up with a litttle help from other warframes the maps and missions are endless you could probly spend an unimaginable amount of hours on this game alone i recomend it to anyone who loves the fast pace shoot em up coop and deathmatch type of alien crazy i mean forever mods weapons and customizability type of game how it got a 68 is beyond me free is 50 and a game that works good is atleast another 25 in my book with the anount of updates i mean like everyday these dudes got there $%^& together i love it for a free game

space ninjas powers guns freaking swords the only thing this game is missing is gratuitous nudity crosses fingers update october 28 2014 so its been over a year since i reviewed this game and its gotten even better where to start the dev team is slowly incorporating more story elements especially for the new players who need guidance as to what theyre doing part of this new drive was the implementation of the new player system which is a quest to introduce the player to warframes basic mechanics while informing you of some of the basic lore other quests now added include howl of the kubrow to get your very own deathdealing cuddleloving furball hidden message to unlock the warframe known as mirage limbo theorem to unlock the impossibly fun warframe limbo who can walk on a completely different plane of existence and last but definitely not least the archwing gundam lovers will just about soil their shorts when they get their hands on this space combat system remember the death star run from episode 6 youll get to experience it yourself note for all those interested in the game if you play for free it can be a very heavy grind and wait times on building items can be brutal 3 days for some things but if you have some patience this games high speed combat mechanics are fantastic but if you dont mind a bit of grind you can even alleviate that some by selling rare mods and prime parts for platinum in the player trade system
recommended
honestly an amazing game once you get past the kinda crappy starter gear and into things you like more it becomes really fun the biggest pushfactor for most players is the crafting time once you get over the fact that you cant always get what you want right away and learn to deal with it it isnt an issue anymore overall a really fun unique game id reccomend it to anyone into any kind of action game
recommended
excellent game  worth downloading playing and becoming addicted to
recommended
i absolutely love this game it is the definition of a amazing free to play experience although you will need to spend some money to get the full experience it is very much worth it in my opinion also supporting indie devs gives you a nice feeling  but the meat meat of the gameplay is the third person ninja shooter being a space ninja ou are very agile and can pull off parkour with ease the gunplay is satisfying and has a lot of impact with great sound assests make hearing and feeling the pop of a headshot i cannot reccomend this game enough but the gripes i have is that the entry level is massive with most of the weapons and frames being very daunting for new player along with some grind it could need patience
recommended
ive put over 110 hours into this game so far i have paid nothing and gotten almost everything in game worth getting just for space ninja killings

warframe warframe started as a decent coop shooter on early beta it had some game breaking bugs but it felt like it had a lot of potential that potential is still there and i doubt it will fade away easily the level design is pretty amazing the tilesets have as much quality as a aaa title but they get very repetitive with time the endgame void missions can be described as kill mobs loot the room and occasionally look for secrets rinse and repeat the bosses started out as pretty meaningful and provided an actual challenge nowadays theyre a means to earn blueprints of specific frames and are incredibly hard with the inclusion of a specific set of bosses that have a specific weak spot which only works half of the time the best boss fight is in my honest opinion lephantis every update they release there are more bugs than additions though most of which get solved pretty fast the game has become quite a farm fest earning the game the term warfarm the devs are terrible at balancing the game specificly by overly nerfing frames and weapons and hardly ever buffing others the grinding involved in farming for frames is extreme and is a great drawback of the game crafting weapons take usually 12 hours companions and rare materials take up to 24 hours the new archwing takes 36 hours to build and frames take 72 hours its tedious to wait so long for new gear this new archwing update is lame the new tileset in space is devoid of content its literally the same map starts in the same place ends in the same place but has you go through different pathways to achieve your objective but to be quite honest ive went on and on about how terrible this game is but its still one of my favorite games and i have spent up to 8 hours in it alone playing with friends its got its share of  sure but they still somehow manage to deliver on a great time which is quite a feat ive not exacly been easy on the examples of how terrible it is im not gonna rate this game on a scale of any sorts its a great game to spend some time in but its below average in key aspects and needs improvement and a lot of it then again its still in open beta so we might see some positive changes over the course of development

this game is so much better since update 14 most people have tryed this game along time ago but give it a 2nd chance because update 14 clears up all of the clutter and confusing interface it is a great game and you should at least try it

all the revenue hooks and addiction lures are super obvious but the core gameplay is rather fun the game is under active development open beta technically and the official forums see plenty of fan submitted content or suggestions reach some stage of in game implementation which is nice

if you dont have money to burn you are in for a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of grinding also has a form of virtual hats so theres that fo srs version pros space ninjas concept 1010 warframes have good designs and diverse powers so two frames dont feel like they play the same but with a different unicorn hat good fun to play with friends that kill you in the dojo after you find a bug in the sparring place enemies are unique and dont feel that much like pallete swaps of the same guy with a gun lots and lots of weapons its got whips whips i tell you bosses usually require a full party of people even the first one cheap  woah dud dem greephiks they is k cons farming simulator 2013 warfarme edition leveling is really tedious for frames and weapons alike usually need high level players to help grind moneyexpresources ect makes you feel slightly like dead weight its not pay to win its pay to get any godamn variety it takes about 3 days to get a new weaponwarframe without spending money suffers from payday 2 disease they have a big update but if you dont have money to spend have fun running around the same missions over and over again to get a small chance to get the parts then farm for the components and then wait days to craft it good update hey kids you want some nano spores 400000 of them currently too much most of the cons can be filtered in to farming simulator complaint mercus rating game of ratingness 25 get friends to play it with you or it gets lonely also technical sequel to dark sector and thats cool

free and never ending fun what more could you ask of in this game basically speaking this is a free to play game where 95% of the in game items can be obtainable of course excluding limited items events and exclusive items beta tester and founders who supported the game when it first started and some appearance options like colors and syandanas capes for your warframe this is not a pay2win there are two currencies in game and one is called credits while the latter is called platinum platinum is used to purchase cosmetic items like colors and syandanas it can also be used to rush wait times when you build things it takes real time to craft the items but it actually isnt much of a bother and is a reasonable wait time youll see when you play the game other than that platinum does not affect performance wise on who is better credits on the other hand is earned quite easily do missions kill stuff open lockerschests but is needed alot of to craft and mod your warframe i also want to add that if you get the right mods or prime parts of a warframe you can actually go to trade chat and sell those items for platinum which can be used for purchasing those color options and syandanas ive yet to spend a single penny on this game which i probably will since the developers of this game are amazing which ill get to that later in this review and i have easily 5 syandanas color palettes lots of inventory spaces and potatoeswhich expand ones mod slots on a warframeweapon  the sheer variety of customization and the amount of weapons at your disposal is insane this game has been severly criticized for being repetitive and what people dont see in this game is the amount of options you can do to have fun you are quite literally a ninja who can parkour around all the maps and use from machine guns to pistols to the simple kunais and katanas ninjas use and thats just a start you can choose to go in guns blazing or even take a more stealthier approach by being invisible and performing assassinations the graphics i have to say are really really top notch theres nothing i can really say about running it on high graphics other than to either experience it yourself or maybe look up a youtube video of how high end the graphics are but that isnt really the same experience this recent update even added in more companions in the form of kubrows doglike allies to be at your side in addition to the sentinels that were floating around helping you in various ways not only is the game amazing but this game offers the most amazing staff of developers and amazing community one can ask the developers actually listen to their players and read forums to give us what we want to see in a game for example nova a warframe or powersuit as you might call it was created by the players the new sword and shield weapon called the silva and aegis was also created by a player whose design was noticed by the developers in addition to two more weapons that are currently still in development the developers even hold streams or prime times in which they interact with the players and talk to us about their upcoming ideas and updates if youre even curious about how dedicated the developers are to this game look up on youtube for an update 14 update the night before the update is released and you can tell how many of them had little to no sleep working on this massive update tldr  free game where you can get 95% of all items excluding founders exclusives and limited edition items that came most likely from events has good graphics has an amazing developer staff and community fun not a pay2win

with beautiful graphics great gameplay a variety of missions to complete many scenarios many bosses strong rpg elements good reasons to fight bosses and great coop gameplay earns this game a huge thumbs up not even considering the fact its free with events frequent updates and even more stuff promised it is a great game and i heartily recommend it the only downside i can think of is the need of platinum money youll have to purchase with actual money this should be resolved with rare chances to gain platinum other than that this game is magnificent ignore the metagame score it deserves much more update on this review warframes a gift that just keeps on giving currently it has 6 factions of varying sizes a codex system a revamped damage system tons of weapons 20 warframes to choose from a variety of missions a whole starmap to fill tons of leveling up frequent updates frequent events hidden areas and at least 8 variations of randomly assembled tile sets its an amazing game with a bright future
recommended
got the game in early may must say that the game has come a long way since then content adding has been doen very well and the addition of special events on a monthly basis has made the game a lot less repetetive than what it used to be the only thing i really dislike about this game is as much as all the essential components in warframe are able to be obtained for free using the crafting feature there is no possible way to abtain free inventory slots for extra weapons other than the 10 you get from the start as for controls they are pretty good although the vertical wallrunning feature can bug at times the recoil system is what to expect from a 3rd person shooter but they have made each weapon have its own recoil trend fps gamers will have no trouble adjusting controls can be changed in game as always but be wary of when you do it as changing in some cinematics will cause a ctd ui has changed several times since the release and the latest one has been the best one yet the missions are put into a web starting from mercury and spreading to the other planets the other features in the main menu are placed accross the top of the screen the ui has several minor and rare problems with locking gameplay is really unique not like any other 3rd person shooters ive every played there is a good diversity in game types and the leveling system is fair the game is very forgiving in early stages being a little too easy with an almost extreme bend in difficulty after the first few planets where it comes to the point where missions may be unplayable solo and will require a team complete epecially in higher t3 void missions and derelict every warframe has its own unique characteristics from health and shields to abilities and appearances which can be enhanced and or altered using mods and apparel customisations found in missions or purchased in store using micro transactions in the game for a free to play i must say it has some aaa title qualities in it and can be a fun game to play with friends you will have to pay a little money down the track if you want to keep all your weapons in the future overall nice experiment its coming along nicely some good features content 710 updating 910 gameplay 810 controls 710 graphics 910 compatibility 810 stability 710 overall 7810

update 14 is the greatest thing that has ever happened to this game the accessibility has skyrocketed there is no better time to play warframe
recommended
ive been with warframe for a very long time even before it was on steam im just as confident now as i was confident then that this game is potentially good with the advancing technologies of graphics and rendering physx and such this game becomes even more beautiful graphically from a long time founder grandmaster of warframe with the honour of being a contributor towards thier progress and the times of ups and downs i still stand firm that warframe is one of the longest games ive ever played in my life warframe has outlived my time in many other shooting games the excitement of the introduction of individual modifications and a vast array of different mods available to the player to be able to accustom towards your won playstyle to the recent update with our own ships that we can roam in no longer a soley menu based interface but a slight hybrid of free roam even when my internet connection was apalling i was still able to play seamlessly the immersion is well above average and their efforts from the developers wont go unnoticed frequent updates and events can ensure that this game wont ever leave you bored alert missions and invasions and even now dark sectors on top of the void missions make more variety than the old repeatable dungeon clearing style of the game maybe im just overconfident with this game but after a good 45 years with them i can tell you this before any judgments made play the game try the game and decide after youve explored all of its glory
recommended
an fpsrpg hybrid that brings its own ideas and objectives to the table dynamic missions that react and change vast randomly generated levels three distinct factions of enemies and plenty of weapons and warframes to take them down

the most engaging mmo i have played to date every new weapon warframe and update changes things up enough to keep me hooked the devs are amazing and pay attention to the community better than any other company ive ever seen best of all you dont have to pay a cent between alerts drops and blueprints you are not required to spend any money one of my favorite games ever
recommended
this is a good game for the first couple of hours but it gets a bit repetitive after that the combat is satisfying and enemies explode into glorious showers of blood but there are a lot of repeated assets and enemies making this a game that you should get if you feel like something fun to play for a couple of hours and its for the wonderful price of nilch so you should probably pick it up
recommended
this game is so fun i cant get enough of it all of it is fun so much things to do in the game this is one of the best 3rd person games yet give it a try you will like it
recommended
a decent f2p 3rd person shooter ill start with the positives first visuals are excellent warframes classes are varied and each have a unique look and application lots of mods or items that will change your weapon sentinel pet or warframe decent amount of lore for those that look hard enough the game is kinda like dark souls in that the story isnt presented directly to you instead its mentioned in a few conversations events and the codex fast pace but easy combat you can easily hit enemies while running along walls doing slides etc easy game to hop on and play a couple rounds and hop off when you feel like provides challenging levels for both experience players at higher levels and casual gamers at lower levels with no real need to go to higher levels except for the challenge consistently update the game and have de have devstreams that shows what they are trying to do and what is planned on being implimented next always good to watch now for the negatives its grindyvery grindy youll spend a while at later levels trying to get a forma a high level material thats needed to either let you relevel your warframeweapon with added benefits or to build good weapons from the dojo or guild hall levels repeat in both layout and mission type defence capture rescue survival with a few others luckly recent updates have been giving planets their own look so the layout problem is being fixed you get laggy games more often then some other games as it is p2p on a 110 scale id give the game 75 in its current state fun gameplay but repetative

you can look at my game time and ive only had this game for about 3 weeks now i only played a couple of hours the first week then got addicted to this game its a very fun scifi based robot alien killing fast paced coop game it does have some features that make it seem like you need to pay but you dont heres the run down you can spamfarm void missions to get in game currency eg selling prime partsfrom void missions for platnium anywhere from 4p to 250p this game is either wait to get it or pay to get it instantly

i love this game so much but i swear to yall i am scared to play by myself i love the fun with me bow the most important thing i would have to say is that know your warframes before you play the game it was kinda difficult when i picked my warframe hinti picked volt it was kinda hard to understand the controls because i have not played a game amazing as this on a pc i strongly recommend this fun thrill ride of a game

a fastpaced actionpacked third person shooter that will entice you within minutes the range of available characters and weapons to unlock and build really add to the games possibilities of ways to play fight and win the only negative thing i have come to notice is that you cant really unlock other warframes to use until mid to late game unless you spend real money but even that just encourages more gameplay and more fun but a word of caution this game does not have a running storyline after the first missions so if you are looking for a plot to get involved in this is not the game needless to say overall this game is a great actionfilled tps that will have you hooked for life and the fun will go on without end

im not a huge fan of fps so having the melee attack & bow option is great the graphics are amazing as well i also like that anyone can be recruited into a squad or you can even select soloas im more prone to soloing

its a really good game considering its free to play i would definitly recommend it to people if they asked me there is alot of action intense gameplay as you progress and lots of great characters to choose from at first it seems a little slow and grindy but when you work hard for what your aiming for it really makes it seem worth while where as some games just hand you the best stuff in a day definitly a good time killer when you get bored or you can always play it in between games

i love warframe and while i dont play the pc version as much as i do the console its fun regardless what platform you play it on

grindy grind but still cool

warframe is truly a wonderful games that ticks all of my boxes its god the best scifi feel best action and of course the ninja feeling to it you can choose what you want to do when it comes to missons want to go in guns blazing go ahead or if you prefer a more stealth approach to it then again go ahead the sound has improved dramatically over the years of warframe and is really been a milestone for the developers to be proud of they always surprise us with every update whether it be small or big the music is perfect it really does add the best theme you can get to battles and of course the music varies from battle to battle the design is just the key symbol of warframe why you ask see for yourself its just perfect every little detail digital extremes puts into the game always made the game more beautiful the lighting is very dynamic its not too bright and not too dark in missions while keeping the good mix of lights to create the desired atmosphere gameplay in my opinion does need a bit of working i just think warframe is really hard to get into when you start as it only gets good when you start getting a real challenge digital extremes did a good job when it came to ninjas i mean come on you get to do parkour you get to run on walls while shooting and perform attacks with your sword in mid air flight thats all i can say really well there is one more thing get the game youll wish you played this game a long time ago 1010

this game is absolutely beautiful and criminally overlooked the developers though very new to the mmo scene have been constantly and tirelessly listenning to community input and giving out tons of awesome things to the players that have been around forever not tomention has somehow predicted almost everything i wanted out of a shooter gae back when i was in like 8th grade or something and to top it all off its 100% free to play meanng there is no excuse to at leas try it yes its buggy but its still in its beta test stage digital extremes has put their all into making an extremely diverse unimaginably expansive and allencompassing gameplay that brings several core gameplay types together in a way that synergizes like no other game ive seen and they manage to do it with a sense of dirty humour that lightens the mood before those pesky server updates that make people restart their games i wholeheartedly recommend warframe to anyone interested in a fun albeit grindy experience did i mention its on pc ps34 and xbone 999999999999999999910 because the menu hub is really laggy for no reason on any computer ive used to play the game but it doesnt interfere with the gameplay in any way

good game this

never heard of it look it up

this game is epic with amazing gameplay amazing graphics and it is just really fun to go around as these alien ninjas 1 tip though dont forget to use your special moves that you learn before anything else epic game
recommended
listen ive been playin this bad boy since the get go and ive watched it grow and prosper so mark my words when this game releases it will be the best 3rd person shooter ever possible catch 22 this game has been in beta for 3 and a half years
recommended
its a rather addictive game and i like playing with kubrow genetics trying to get an interesting one o
recommended
this is one high graphiced game with a great story line love it
recommended
great game very good coop if you wanted to play something with your friends however the solo gameplay is just as good even though you can buy things in the game with real money it is not a pay to win game as long as you play regularly you will be able to get the best gear just like everyone else highly recommend the game
recommended
one really enjoyable game especially with friends also you can play it for free without needing to buy anything also space ninjas are cool
recommended
if you got the time and effort this game is fun and easy paying makes the game boring and short lasting appeal i mean yeah colors are cool to buy but the items that you can buy for free not cool bro i find it funny this games a beta and if you have friends or strangers and the good guns you can have some extreme fun or just hangout in your clan dojo or shoot a random army down and i played this game 2 months after beta release so i know what im doing this game is phenonmal i cant imagine whats in the full version lost out
recommended
cool
recommended
recommended for third person view style lover nothing more to say to this awesomeness wish i played this 1 year earlier 
recommended
this game is one of the first games i got when i got steam i love this game this is an amazing game its almost hard to believe its free love it
recommended
pros  good customisation  good combat  sound quality is excellent cons  no clear story your just thrown into the battle with no real reason to kill the enemies apart from your told to and that theyre shooting at you  repetetive environments jungle factory maybe if your lucky a bright factory  odd weapon unlock system overall i would reccomend this game for the combat and customisation alone however if you look for fun and story telling in a game then this isnt the game for you the gore may give you some giggles for the first few times you make an enemies torso fly into space team rocket style but once youve seen one decapateted enemy sliced and diced like mince meat youve seen them all
recommended
all those of you who like hardcore coop shooters like warframe will be delighted with its content although its reliability of you spending real world money on a free game is kind of unfair
recommended
warframe is great its lore is fantastic the setting and artistic designs are excellent and its gameplay and replayability are quite recommended i easily found myself wanting to know more about the tenno the lotus the other factions the infestation viruses and mysteries within the solar system orokin and the void anyone but the game explains very little outside the minisolo vors campaign this game could have easily been my game of the year if it wasnt for so many issues regarding its game design the most infuriating one being > its clearly a not player friendly game  youre early forced to choose a single warframe and weapon composition at the very beginning of the game and commit to it whether you like it or not  the vor campaign feels like a mini tutorial its a fantastic way to explain the game mechanics and part of its lore yet once its finished the game feels kinda empty plot wise and very little is explained failing a mission will result into a totaltimewaste inc  playing stealthy is pointless i found myself going sneaky bow bo and kunai fighting when to my surprise the matchmaking kept throwing players at my game gunblasting and speeding throughout levels therefore ruining the solo experience i had enjoyed so far  soloing survival  capture  defense missions is a titanic task matchmaking is then mandatory and it may result into godlike 1000 grinded hours players or hi i just killed vor and i barely know how to warframe bro players so good luck grinding for crafting materials throughout the solar system in a wide variety of missions is fun grinding a concrete annoying boss im talking about at you alad v and your pesky zanuka for a rare material that may or may not drop in order to craft an important part of the game such as warframes helmets is not 80% of the mods you find are just salvage  vendor meat map repetitiveness predictable ai from the enemies and very little purpose on doing some missions makes you lose eagerness to login daily quite easily learning curve is quite blur and once you master the sprint  slide  melee attack drill thats pretty much it aside from warframes powers dont get me wrong most of what ive played from it is incredible for a f2play game combat is fluid build options are quite wide 2handed shotguns spamming lightning warframes stealth tankymelee etc and coop features clans and the like will have you willing for more still the game grabs you in hooks you up for a while and tries to milk the platinum out of you at some points youll feel like playing dark souls 3000 some missions are plain t to go through alone or no money invested again having to wait 3 days for your new hardearned warframe to come out of the foundry or not being able to customize it with the colour you like cosmetics aside is not cool yo i wouldve definitely paid 40 bucks for a solid well put together single player campaign and a patchable online mode with 100% of the content reachable by crafting but since the game offers the chance of not paying i will continue to login every now and then and grind with no purpose at all since the real cool stuff like orokin reactors formas and its like are something out of the plebs reach at this point and considering all of the above im quite certain to say that free 2 play model has screwed warframe up see you next patch tenno
recommended
its really worth it to play this
recommended
this game is really fun i recommend it to other people that havent got this already if you do get it you will enjoy it a lot
recommended
an awesome futuristic game based on the competing factions of the tenno grineer corpus and the infested you can acheive new warframes and modify them to their full extent honestly a really fun game when you get good stuff 7510

space ninjas with guns and magic seriously this is one of the best games ever has great graphics easy to learn gameplay and decapitating enemies very easy to mix and match guns swords and warframes to create your own class but since its still in beta theres still some bugs 910
recommended
i dropkicked a man and he survived 910 will give 10 if it could instantly kill

if you like space and ninjas download this beast

bugs make this game
recommended
fun game at least try it free to play all the way you can get everything you need from the game itself without spending any real money on it if you are picky and want this or that colour on your warframeweapon or if you have a save everything mania such as saving all different warframes and all weapons etc then yes you ned to cough up a bit of money hey you get resources easily with some grinding depending on your level of tolerance grinding is not so bad and you get blueprints easily by killing boses  you can afford to sell the weapons and warframes to make room for more without feeling too much of a loss yes totally free and fun game repetitive only if you play solo or claim to play with others yet run away from them all the time  yeah you need to learn teamplay so if u arent one then get lost right now ^^
recommended
full of everything that make a freetoplay mmo brilliant even runs on computers that arent as beefy as the current lot 5 stars mate oh yeah and its about alien ninjas
recommended
this game combines amazing graphics and fun fast gameplay into a amazing package the division between different warframes and modifications available make this game unique the best part is that there is no pay to play yes to get things it gets alittle grindy but its worth it well made game with more coming up for it hopefully
recommended
good game nice graphics and a good playability

ive spent some time playing mmos but this one changed everything fast paced battles awesome graphics crafting great community if you want a good tps mmo give this one a try

this game is epicfuture ninjas and hacking are a great combinationthe parkour in this game is awsome
recommended
you can look at my game time and ive only had this game for about 3 weeks now i only played a couple of hours the first week then got addicted to this game its a very fun scifi based robot alien killing fast paced coop game it does have some features that make it seem like you need to pay but you dont heres the run down you can spamfarm void missions to get in game currency eg selling prime partsfrom void missions for platnium anywhere from 4p to 250p this game is either wait to get it or pay to get it instantly
recommended
i love this game so much but i swear to yall i am scared to play by myself i love the fun with me bow the most important thing i would have to say is that know your warframes before you play the game it was kinda difficult when i picked my warframe hinti picked volt it was kinda hard to understand the controls because i have not played a game amazing as this on a pc i strongly recommend this fun thrill ride of a game
recommended
ive played this game for about 1000 hours total ive made different accounts to start over and found that warframe got better at helping new players in the game learn faster by delivering interactions one step at a time instead of a overload of information all at once over all the game is great and almost never ending
recommended
space ninjas with guns plus its free download the game already
recommended
good and interesting game  
recommended
this a realy great game i recommend getting it
recommended
this is a great game and well worth playing
recommended
warframe was fast paced run through chop them up and shoot them up

sick game for sure great graphics great gameplay epic fights nothing more to say you like to fight here is your game in 3d baby
recommended
this game rocks
recommended
awesome awesome awesome not too to pay to win just a bunch of farming but its worth it coz while u r farming u r still having fun d however it does get repetitive and predictible at times so i recommend dont play too much a day unless u r farming for forma or potatos
recommended
this is a pretty great game as long as you dont mind alot of waiting and grinding its updated pretty frequently with new content which is pretty great its a good game but you have to be willing to invest some time into it in order to get any good
recommended
great game fun to play overall one of my personal favourites
recommended
this game is like a combination of star wars star trek halo mass effect and everything that is scifi and awesome all in one while still having a wide arrange of originality its an amazing game the graphics are stunning the gameplay is fluid and original the customization is infinite and best of all its free get this game 1000010
recommended
why havent i picked this game up earlier
recommended
one of the most correct f2p shooter every one have to try it
recommended
scifi online shooterslasher oriented on cooperative gameplay missions with varied difficulty assasinationespionage missions various abilities to improve your character and weaponry as well as levelling system for both your character and each weapon you use freetoplay though you gonna pay some real money for some classy weaponry and characters though its totally okay to level up your starter set of weapons and your first character to a state of a kickass killing machine without no money spent at all not to mention crafting system  do missions on specified regions collect resourses and make these weaponry and chars by yourself for free and ingame funds good luck have fun
recommended
good game & great game developers ive play this game since theres nothing fishy and while i played this game for the main game i see lots of updates game dev team are so great more of bugs fixed many thing updates not only the weapons

every second you spend reading this review  is a second not spent playing this game  so you want a better explanation of this game eh  then lets get the biggest negative point out of the way first  this game has grinding like youve never seen before  but if you really cant wait you can always pay to speed things up  most of the time youll be doing this for the crafting  and trust me crafting in this game isnt on the level of most rpg games where you gather materials from hunting a lot of the same enemy and finding a crafting table to make it  this games crafting is on the level of mobile games  everything takes time to complete  most weapons take 12 or 24 hours to complete while a new frame to play takes at least 3 and a half days  but of course you can skip all this by paying  there is one more negative point  but this can be viewed as also positive so ill explain it in a moment still with me  good  on to the good part  each frame has their own individual powers ranging from turning invisible to shooting ice or fire to turning every enemy against each other to summoning the dead  and this gives each frame a new way of playing each mission  leveling in this game isnt like other game either  you dont get stronger by gaining exp and leveling up you frame and weapons  this is where the other negative point comes in  you see this game contains something known as mods  you use these mods to increase damage  range  efficiency or even give your weapons an elemental effect  but in order to futher make you weapon or frame stronger you need to level up those mods  and the only way you can do that is by fusing spare mods with it  because of this some mods can take over 1000 hours before you hit its maximum level  or rank as this game calls it  but you dont get to just throw any mod in all you like for there are 2 limits that you need to follow  see every weapon and frame comes with a limit and that is 8 mods maximum with the execption of frames and melee weapon who have 9  plus they all have a mod capacity  think of it as a weight limit that you cant go over  that fills each time you put in a mod  and the stronger the mod the more it fills up  of course there are ways you can increase this limit such as doubling it  only once though  and installing something known as a forma  the game itself is rather rollercoaster like  sometimes youll find youself running and shooting so many enemies youll happilly say holy crap its only been 2 minutes  when you find out very little time has actually passed sometimes and sometimes youll be so bored because of how slow things are that youll find your self dismally saying  holy crap its only been 2 minutes  and for a specific mission known as survival where you need to kill enemies and hope they drop life support for you to pick up so you can replenish you own life support so you can stay longer but they dont drop any life support and you realise your life support getting dangerously low and you scream  holy crap its only been 2 minutes  if you want to pick up this game i suggest finding at least 3 other friends you can play with cause this is a game thats more fun in a group of people you use skype or the in game mic to talk with  in the end i highly recommend you playing this game  its a great game now and its only getting started 
recommended
awesome game fast paced and lots of missions and stuff to do
recommended
great graphics wonderful gameplay and a caring community
recommended
i absolutely love this game although im not the greatest player i feel like it is a game that is easy to learn the controls are easy and the gameplay is awesome i love the graphics and the freedom you have when it comes to customization of your character and weapons

space ninjas space ninjas 1111111 and a ton of grinding and also more grinding 1010
recommended
warframe is a cooperative tps action game set in an scifi universe basically magical space ninjas shooting and slicing everyone and this makes it a pretty addictive game
recommended
if you like ninjas space and mass effect 3s mulitplayer this is the game for you warning highly addctive another warning you must pay for weapon and warframe slots but honestly you can make money in the trade channel to do that so not a big deal
recommended
i give it an about 810 good visuals very fun gameplay 97% of the stuff you can get for free without paying alot of grinding however and there is no story as of yet still in beta and there isnt much end game content but however that is most likely to change in due time notewill lag you to hell if you dont have a good computer
recommended
great game fun as to play all that choppin up and killing d would pay $ for this game 1010
recommended
its scary and a little too high quality for my graphics chip but its an awesome game for ninjas
recommended
ninjas in space what else needs to be said great fun fast paced intense moments best experienced with friends can be done solo but expect it to get a lot harder
recommended
brilliant game
recommended
from a purely objective point of view this is quite possilby the best game ive played graphically its on a par with some of the high end games which for a f2p game is quite impressive there are a few minor clipping issues but thats true of everything the gameplay is fast paced brutal and highly addictive the levelling is simple it doesnt take long to max out a weaponframe but there are 120odd weapons and 20odd frames with more of both being released all of the time this leads on nicely to the only problem i have with the game when you first start youll probably have excalibur you do have the choice of 3 frames but most people seem to go for him lato braton & skana with no clear signs of how to unlock the others it then takes a while to gather your resources and start building this can be a bit off putting but i urge you to carry on
recommended
i feel like this game is if gears of war and assassins creed had a babyi do wish that there was more of a need of the parkourbut the combat is fluent and great this game is a blast to play with friends and i would reccomend it if you want a coop game
recommended
its fun

imagine if a moba and a third person shooter had a child now add space ninjas its a free to play game and its great people stop reading the review and download it already its great its not pay to win and if you think it is your probabley insane just go download itlike right nowstop reading this what else do you want there are ninjas a great clan system ninjas a fun variety of powerful yet intresting weapons ninjas parkour and etc at the time of writing this the game has a update every wensday not counting hotfixes adding new weapons and other various changes everything is always fairly balanced and the characters all feel unique and different from one another i could go on for a long time about how much i enjoy this game but to sum this review up download it now what are you waiting for if you already downloaded the game i have no clue why your still reading this review the developers tend to be very active in the community and livestream on twitch every 2 weeks to talk about various things feel free to watch that and learn about various things like sneak peeks about new weapons and stuff its free to play so if you hate it the only thing you really wasted is your time and thats not really so bad now is it and honestly if it is then you shouldnt of been playing a game to begin with dummy

space ninjas this game is really good it has a nice fast paceinteresting storyatmosphere and characters and awesome gameplay the guns and swords feel so good to use and it provides a nice challange to those looking for one there are some issues that bother me since i last played was a while ago but leveling up and getting money takes forever and i feel that with the third person camera there should be a cover system of sorts not to mention the few bugs here and there but that arent gamebreaking 910 it was okay ign

easily the most addictive visually unique and engaging freetoplay game i have played in a very long time

space ninjas nuff said  1010

this coop shooter really gets to you unlike others the storyline isnt that great but who cares when you can have weapons and skills that can slaughter enemies by the hundreds i put it many hours into this game and it is well worth the time and money if you are into the pay to get latest item first kind of people if not just normal play is very addictive so if you think shooting with style is your thing then warframe is for you
recommended
awesome game full of alot of small glitches but always getting better
recommended
best game ive played in a long time
recommended
a little repetitive but the customization teamwork and overall fun factor completely make up for it

this is an awesome game i would pay for this lucky its free though p 910

holy cow why didnt i start playing this sooner i heard about this game when it was still in closed beta and thought it had to be stupid i started playing it a little over a month ago and all i can say is wow addicted
recommended
one of the best if not even the best free2play game i have ever played no pay to win because mostly its played as a coop game you can get pretty much everything with ingamecash and resources you farm on the different planets buying it with real money is much faster but pretty much unneccesary through daily login presents you can even get a discount price for platinium the cash you gain through real money i recomment playing it with friends on teamspeak its easier and much more fun plus you can talk about how you want to handle the missions rushing through them mostly farming every single piece of sht or going trough stealthy the game gets much attention form the gamemarkers buggfixes can be seen often  in my opinion clearly a 1010 or  d

pretty great and free although there are some annoying limitations that cant be overcame without speding a few bucks but even considering that its a considerably cheap game updated weekly and with something that has been missing in games for a long time clan building you can actually build stuff and design you clan hall the way you want it be it an maze like structure with things thrown around like crazy or a perfectly symmetric beauty its not a fast thing to do but it can be done and it can be done for free with no real money involved the action is great there is a good variety of weapons and framesthe characters you play there is still long way to go and it can only get better start now and do not risk losing alot of nice prizes in the events that are ran at least once a month or so get an invite httpswarframecomsignupreferrerid5154406d1a4d80276800006c my ingame name is xpyder

this is an amazing game i saw this when i was young and i got that face and that feelingthat goooood feelingi eventually forgot about it but then a few faithful months agoduring my last days of grade 6 i found this game again it is free who does not like free games but i did not get it because it was free i am very catious with my choosing of games and a free game id probably pass because usually free games are small boring things or good alphas and betasand this one happened to be a beta when i got it usually when playing a beta i say oh hey look at that thats pretty cool but these things do not look so good and this needs work and but warframe but this was different this was to me no way a beta it had all this and that and those and also these it had swords lasers ninjas multiple male and female characters dismemberment of enemy bodies for when you felt down it had scythes and daggers and hammers and axes it had maps galore it had good textures sentinels and i hpe im not getting ahead of myself but this game is just so amazing and i reccomend this game and everything it stands for 100%
recommended
with the fate of your race in the balance it is up to you and the few remaining tenno to push the enemy out of the solar system 810 a lot of fun with friends gets difficult if you try to take on higher levels alone the use of schematics to acquire weapons and warframes makes the feeling of getting new equipment all the more satisfying although if you are not a patient person the ability to purchase the equipment directly through the use of platinum which is purchased with real money can help you get the quick advantage over the enemy

this game is just amazing it gets new updates and hotfixes weekly adding more content for you to play and explore with friends

if you are debating wether or not you want to download warframe download it many of my friends tell me its to complicated or its boring i will admit i felt a little overwhelmed at the beginnig but i got over it as everything became understandable along with the awesome people you can meet online i promise you that you will have at least a small bit of fun do i recommend this game yes
recommended
now this game for free is totaly awesome not sure id spend the hudreds that you could to be invinceable but you can progress and rank up with a litttle help from other warframes the maps and missions are endless you could probly spend an unimaginable amount of hours on this game alone i recomend it to anyone who loves the fast pace shoot em up coop and deathmatch type of alien crazy i mean forever mods weapons and customizability type of game how it got a 68 is beyond me free is 50 and a game that works good is atleast another 25 in my book with the anount of updates i mean like everyday these dudes got there $%^& together i love it for a free game

warframe has cought me by strom i am not normaly in to games like this but this one has me locked down i hope to see great things to come i give this game currently a 8510

it takes a bit to get used to how to equip various mods upgrading your armorweps etc but is absolutely worth it the graphics are awesome the levels are friggin amazing and it can surely give a challenge to any kind of player the frames armor for each class looks absolutely amazing and each class has its personal skill ultimate basically thats cool

way too addictive cant stop playing must sleep more

1100 hours and still loving it i will post an honest review about this game some people might not like the cons section hey even i dont like it but this is true about this game and you cant or even i cant deny it pros  developer interaction with community  hotfixesupdates every wednesday  new content almost every month  huge pro its not a pay to win game you can get every single warframe weapon sentinel and even that prime without spending even a single benjamins or i can say those green notes exception is customization or i can say those sparkly stuff to make your warframe weapon or sentinel look nice  this game rewards you for playing what i mean is go on missions farm some mods weapon or warframe parts and then sell them in trading post for in game premium currency  this game has one of the best clandojo system i have ever seen  not to forget about future updates thatll include player ships new tile sets hubs focus system and much more  my final thought on pros section is that this game is highly addicting and no pay to win bs if something that effects gameplay like weapons warframe sentinels then you can get it for free cons  relies heavily on rng which can be a pain in the behind devs know about this issue but still they dont do nothing instead they use rng more and more and recently they introduced it in events yes i am talking about recent breeding grounds event  sometimes devs have tendency to listen to new new players and implement changes that are not necessary and useless i mean who can give more clear and important feedback a guy who just started playing and thinks everything in game is op or the one whos been playing for 100s of hours  if you dont like grinding for stuff then items that you purchase from market for premium currency platinums in this game are way too exepnsive  major issue this game has is rng my final point in cons section is that if you dont have problem with rng and grinding then this game is for you and if you have problem with grinding and rng then youll end up buying stuff in market which is expensive i mean one weapon can cost you up to 250 platinums or about 15usd now its up to you what and how you want new stuff in this game by grinding or by paying overall this game is highly addicting stuff that effects gameplay is free and sparkly stuff will cost you money developers have to make money too right rng can be a pain in the behind but with the help of friends and clan mates this issue can be resolved new stuff that developers have planned for future major updates is extremely awesome overall i highly recommend this game

pretty exciting and offers many ways to get even the strongest gear while purchasing platinum is a much faster way to obtain things almost everything is obtainable without purchasing anything the frustrating thing about this game is definitely the net code and the irritating amount of customization options that are totally locked unless you purchase them with platinum  on that note freebies are given away at random holidays ie christmas and valentines day

youve always wanted to be a badass space ninja warframe puts you there controls are tight progression is multifaceted and theres always improvements being made graphically symphonic its free what the frack are you waiting for

this game is by far one of the best games i have played i dont normally care for shooter games i like racing games and open world games that pretty much have cars in them like nfs games and gta granted gta is considered shooter game but basically warframe is most deffenitly an exception the graphics are great and the animations good and its also addictive and its free to play their is only one thing that seems to be a problem though and that is not only can you play with other people you can also play solo which is great but when your not connected to the internet and you want to play warfame in solo you cant apparently you have to have the internet in order to play at all which is basically my only complaint but even at that i most deffenitly recommend this game
recommended
epic game amazing with friends and its one of the few free to plays that is not pay to win you can do every weapon frame and items without paying a penny great for ppl that love scifi be aware that the game is always in development but the devs are realy supporting d i give it 910 gg pps
recommended
this game is absoulutly amazing one of the best f2p game ever also great to play with friends but it is even still a great game with strangers
recommended
the game is great overall but with just a few little problems its extremely repetative almost the exact same place everytime with just a slightly different objective the weapon and character mods are really only what keep it interesting also once you run out of platinum you have to pay for more if it wasnt such a fast paced shooter then i would have stopped playing within the first hour but once you start you just cant stop so even with the cons i would say get it because it is a pretty decent free game and is great if your just a casual gamer looking for some fun fast paced gameplay

the best game

are you a space ninja do you want te be a space ninja have you ever had a weird fantasy involving space ninjas and maybe a couple of digestive biscuits if so look no further than halo rea i mean warframe with advanced sliding phisics over 2 melee weapons and hundreds of bullets at your disposal this game is really a revolution in dungeon crawling i would highly recommend this game to all players of literally any type of game because if you dont like space ninjas you probably dont like life
recommended
yes this game is a really example of what can be done with time and dedictaion to your craft this game is great for its coop and single player aspects and the fact that its free is amazing if you compare this to some like payday 2 were you have to pay for it and it makes payday look like it was made by a 10 year old
recommended
really fun with a group of friends on voice coms the coop is great and synergistic between personal choices once you reach more advanced levels of play
recommended
free addictive ecxelent coop and it even has options for rvery play style 110% reccomended
recommended
this game is unique there isnt any other game like this if you dont beilive your welcome try to find another game like thisgood luck but even that wont help you
recommended
its good
recommended
this game is one of the best games i have ever played
recommended
this over all a great game the cash store system is very well made i dont feel like its trying to force me into spending money everything can be earned in game through playing the only thing you have to spend platinum  the ingame cash store currency on is cosmetics color pallets cosmetic attachments fo your warframe you still do not have to actually spend money on the game though you can earn items in game and sell teh m to other players for platinum you can earn all the platinum you need fairly easily this way
recommended
highly recommened this game is fast paced encourages teamwork and has space ninjas i mean really space ninjas the missions will keep you interested as long as you dont spam the same one the gunplay is great and the reward system well to put it simply its actually rewarding this game still gets updates as well which is great and unlike certain games if a player walks over credits everyone gets the money and it isnt split so if one person walks over 300 dollars you all get 300 dollars also the customazation seems to go on forever the only downside is that some items you have to buy with platinum which must be bought with real money but it isnt nessacary to buy the platinum for a great time in this game but by buying it you help support this game and make any needed updates come easier and faster i rate this game as a 97 out of 100 just great also you can include your friends and start a clan
recommended
warframe is its kinda you know i honestly cant describe this game and its uniqueness or atleast what uniqueness it has which is a lot all in all this game has everything it has tight controls a variety of map structures for example if you played first mission once it will be a different map setup each and every time with the exception of the objective room that will always look the same however the layout is always different theres a large variety of weapons and warframes warframes the games name warframes areodd i honestly have no idea what they are they could be robots or remotly controlled or even a person in a suit no one really seems to know as for controls you can do many different combat manuvers heres a few of my favorites backflips wall runup and side front flips flying kicks and so much more not to mention this is the most well polished free to play game with the best model of it you can get everything for the paid currency or you can craft it for free simply put i freakin love this game to peices 9510 the crafting takes 12 hours on normal thingsweapons components and 3 days on warframes
recommended
this game impressed me so much that i nearly fell of my chair the first time i saw warframe i thought to my selfhow great can this game be then i played itman did i injoy it <didwhat am i talking about i still love this game the graphics is good by that i mean insanethe gameplay is surprisingly awesome and it has a nice touch of team work if you die your freind can still help you from getting back into that insane battelfeild of course you can play offline but thatshow do i put thiscinda hardyep allotthis game is very fun aswell from shocking a corpus to cutting greneer in half this game is all about going mad insane if thats what you whant to call it so hack and slash your whay through warframe give it a try

the best free to play game ever
recommended
this game has taken away my soul and all my emotions leaving me a shell of the man i once was 1010
recommended
this is by far one of the best free2play games i have ever played my windows computer isnt that great i have to run almost lowest settings the good thing is i get no lag the graphics are amazing and the missions are great the only bad thing is that platinumin game curremcy is a little overprices for how much you could buy over all i would recommend this game to everyone
recommended
by now i have hundreds of hours in warframe and i can confidently say that it is a great game if you dont mind grind oh my god the grind it isnt new spiral knights level grind but it is not uncommon to run missions for hours for a single rare mod that drops from one type of enemy but the gameplay is pretty solid the game looks great and the devs are more than willing to listen to the community about things that need changing or fixing content is regularly being added and de does its best to keep the community involved and in the loop including letting the fans compete to design weapons overall 810 because it just keeps pulling me back in
recommended
i do recommend this game to anyone who doesnt have a crappy computer its free to play so lets keep this in mind as we go along on this wonderful journey warframe in my opinion has beautiful graphics and scenery it does lack in the story department just a tad however it makes up for it in its fun style of game play and etc etc overall if you spend more than 3 hours on your computer this is a game to get one thing i might mention though is the new player experience be cautious ^^ have fun tenno ps this is probably a crappy review seeing as how it is my first game review it may also be extremely crappy because im bored enjoy deciphering it
recommended
warframe the better game i have never seen before  very good game a delicious blend of the finest style of play last years awesome beautiful style etc  a word bravo

its a great multi player free game with a choice of weapons quests pets and money i love the game because its fun to play with your mates and i recommend it
recommended
this game is cool like a coop hack and slash scifi game  tps shooter awesome
recommended
i feel like this is a game im gonna be playing for a while pros  ninja space swords shotguns  coop elements  awesome introduction  multiple guns and a awesome arsenal  also some rpg elements added cons  kinda lags on lowest settings  i prefer first person  some p2w elements but at least they dont scream money at you i recommend this game for the awesome shooting n stuff and cool storyline
recommended
ive been waiting for this and its here finally
recommended
wow just wow this game has to be one of the best free to play f2p video games that i have ever played as you can expect there are some microtransactions howver they do not take away from the gameplay aspect of the game they only thing that money can give you in this game is that it takes away the tons of time you have to spend in this game to get anything good in conclusion this game is definitely worth it i mean for crying out loud the game is free free you can spend hundreds of hours in this game and still have something new to keep you going rate 910
recommended
this is free2play done correctly it offers players the ability to spend a decent amount of time playing the game to unlock weapons and different warframes organically through gameplay or you can spend monies to unlock them instantaneously the requirements to acquire new weapons and warframes and even pet drones that help the player in battle are not overly tedious or grindy they take a while and the work put into getting anything in the game feels very well worth it however there is one f2p practice that i dislike and if i could id discourage all developers from doing paying real money for color schemes so what if i want to paint my warframeweaponsdrone a different color than their standard colors nope give us some money first i understand that digital extremes is trying to make some money off the game with the starter packs buying wepons and warframes in the game with real money without any wait or work but paying for color schemes thats kind of meh in my book anyways despite that one business practice this game is amazing and easily is my second favorite game of all time easily scores a 910 and would get a 1010 if the monetization of colors wasnt in there
recommended
its game about perfect futuristic life form of space knights defending universe against every form of evil 
recommended
very good game its fun and cool with powers like dash slice and other powers like that its really fun but i mostly pefer it with friends i recomend this psfor u who dont know this game is connected to dark sector if u dont know what that game is go buy or watch a playthrough on youtube and youll see how its connected
recommended
awesome game through the ninja description may be misleading you dont get much of stealthy content p although its fully f2p you can get all the fancy items totally free in pretty short time all the items only availble for platinum cosmetics arent overpriced you can get platinum by trading some wanted items which are also easy enough to get and buying platinum is also not so big deal when you get the 75% discount for daily logging in which actually drops pretty often too taking it back to gameplay itself we have a really nice world in means of graphics and lore hard to dig it game is highly optimized highly customizable only downside i noticed so far are bugs a bunch of them more or less anoying still worth a bit of nerves for that fancy game and looking at de work the game keeps on growing getting better and getting fix
recommended
i can play this free yeah ive spent about 4050 bucks and i feel ready to play my way im grinding again a few more dollars will get me what i want but my video game budget is down yeah i love gaming and they love my $ metal gear rising with good controls and mutiplayer and bareboned story gamers like to fill in the blanks but common i didnt buy this but spent my money the way i wanted to gamers are skeptical about microtransactions but i never bought the game in the first placeso i think we all came ahead on wf lets hope the devs keep that in mind and not milk our wallets
recommended
this game is nice if you have a lot of free time on your hands and this is not a pay to win game everything can be made if you have time to do so
recommended
fun and fast gameplay with interesting features would recommend to play it with friend or it can get a bit boring after some time also a bit grindy  but in all id recommend it
recommended
great game
recommended
yes  that simple
recommended
awsome a must play
recommended
warframe has really high flashy graphics integrated with nvidia physx technology all the explosions bullets have make the gameplay more intense and enjoyable however the missions and maps are very repetitive resulting the game to be dull in addition to that the is no really helpful guide in the game i find it very difficult to understand the game mechanics until i have done my research in warframe wikia and warframe forum
recommended
ninjas with guns in space doing parkour plus magic just play it its free you have no excuse
recommended
warframe though it may be slow at first is an outstanding free to play game with a  amount of content and completely new classes and weapons and cosmetic items earned completely free it is also an excellent deal i have spent no money at all and about 60 hours in have constructed dozens of weapons hundreds of mods and killed thousands of enemies give it a try and add me if you need some help 85100
recommended
a very pretty scifi shooter with impressive ninjastyle gameplay levels are randomly generated so if you replay a mission its different every time this can get a bit repetitive when the same room or corridor is used 4 times in the same level though but hey its space efficiency in ship design is crucial p unfortunently there are no free female warframes by default you have to pay for one or basically complete half the game to craft them normally i wouldnt complain about this but warframe promotes heavy character development and customization ergo its difficult for me to get in touch and immersived in such a game while playing a male character other than that its a really nice game oh and free to play of cause
recommended
this game has two things i normally dislike free to play and a strong multiplayer focus on top of that it has next to nothing going on in terms of story or characters however it is a ton of fun to play gradually improving your equipment and facing larger odds and threats is very satisfying and its easy to find a build that feels unique to you or be a boring person and follow a guide i guess it takes a while to get going there are some rough edges its a beta after all but the combat is very rewarding and generally fair and the monetization mechanics are generally not that annoying
recommended
awesome action game to play with friends d
recommended
this game has changed alot for the better from when i last played it it is now in my top 5 favorite games instead of my top 5 worst games 1210 dolphins
recommended
what more is there to do than recommend this game first of all its free to play this means you dont have to pay money to play it it does not mean it will run like those flashgames that represented what was free to play just 5 years ago although free to play used in the manner as it is used in warframe it means you can play without paying but paying could make the experience better nonetheless as a nonpaying user i think for myself that it plays just fine for free warframes looks are equal to or better than most aaa releases and the gameplay is likewise it might take more than a few hours of playing it to understand how to work it properly and it doesnt always tell you excactly how to pull off every move but this also leaves a lot of room for experimentation which i think is one of the points where this game shines rather brightly if you like ninjas scifi shooters stealth actions or slashers warframe is likely to hit you in at least one good spot
recommended
i have no idea who and why am i killing all those things that are who and where but i totally enoyoj it and u can upgrade ur  definetly worth tryin d
recommended
good game if you like free running and kicking the enemys  only bad thing about this game is the bugs and connection issues but then no one likes that stuff anyway
recommended
this game might repeat itself a bit butt in the end of the day it is one of the most amazing f2p there is with hours of playing tons of guns characters and missions to unlock and play not to mention it is coop this game is not one of those pay to play crap in this game if you pay you only rush stuff up everything that costs can be crafted whitch gives even more play time in other wordsdownload it nowww heavy voice
recommended
very good if you have a strong enough computer awesome graphics and gameplay well worth playing
recommended
very futuristic good graphics and effects
recommended
its a very fun game
recommended
now warframe is a special type of game its about you and the so called teno the teno is a high technological grupe thats like assassins and guardians they are all master of parcur the nice thing about this game is that nomatter what your into there is usually somthing you will like fighting there are plenty of maps to play and there is wave maps if you get board builder you can get a clan and if you have a clan you can get a clan dojo which is this giant space ship you can build rooms in supporter you can gather recorses to build on your dojo or make wepons and warframes the downside is that when you have picked your first warframeplayermodle you cant change it unless you buy a blueprint and make a new one or buy it for platinium also the level decine is annoying becaus its the same goddame thing your running through the first 47 maps but else then that the game is great and if you got friends you got a epic team
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
it was fun
recommended
warframe mah gawd
recommended
glory to warframe when i first started the game offered a challenging scaling game with all the updates after it the story progresses and the game gets better de tries hard as a developer to listen to its fan base not so much on here but on their own forums fast paced gameplay ninjas and a great sci fi setting are the hallmarks of this game i still have not yet cleared every map point and the alert missions keep me on my toes as i see chances for good loot and the battles between the corpus and grineer id recommend this game to anyone who has an open mind and maybe a buddy or two willing to give it a shot with u14 a great tutorial launched making the learning curve less of a pain good luck if you take the game up if not best of luck where you end up
recommended
well uh this game has good graphics thats about it \
recommended
this is what happens when you marry the excitement of the mass effect trilogy to the gears of war franchise you would have warframe if you enjoy both those games the visuals of mass effect and all its scifi goodies and just want hords of baddies coming at you get this game

i really love warframe butthey need to add more wild on earth hope that happends

i went into warframe thinking itd just be another orion dino horde after about 6 hours of nonstop gameplay a lack of a need to purchase ingame items with real money jumping into bulletfest after bulletfest and an utter addiction to being a proper freakin gunandswordweilding space ninja i said otherwise
recommended
a surprisingly fun game the combat is fluid and intuitive the pay shop is essentially unnecessary as the different framescharacters can be unlocked with a little bit of play time even so the need to play as a different character doesnt overly change the experience because gear progression is persistent between classes ignore the preconceived freetoplay stigma and just give the game a decent shot teaming up in 4 man missions to defend and objective exterminate a level or just survive is reminiscent of the fun had while playing killing floor but in 3rd person with ninjas and a bunch of different guns and powers ok its nothing like killing floor but its a hell of a lot a fun and it costs nothing to give it a try some good quotes from the goons forum what is this game warframe is a freetoplay coop thirdperson shooter with some melee combat and lootcollection elements set in the far far future where you play as an eyeless mute space ninja here have some lore gameplay comparisons tend to gravitate to mass effect 3s multiplayer and hellgate london major features of the game include procedurally generated levels fast action with a focus on mobility and looking like the badass space ninja you are as well as a fairly sane f2p model which generally doesnt make you want to recoil in horror crazy i know the game is currently out on the pc via the official website and steam and playstation 4 via psn warframes developer is digital extremes previously known for their work codeveloping the unreal series alongside epic more recent titles have been somewhat less illustrious mostly helping with console ports of unrealengine titles such as bioshock and developing multiplayer components of various other titles their proprietary evolution engine was developed during this time and has been used in dark sector the darkness ii and now warframe  gameplay  warframe is a fastpaced overtheshoulder 4player shooter with an added emphasis on melee attacks every player is equipped with primary and secondary weapons as well as a melee weapon each class or warframe has up to four useable skills that are unlocked as your character levels up your weapons also level up independently of your frame and can be sold for credits or used freely on another frame you own as you progress with your weapons and frame of choice youll gain the ability to customize both for added effectiveness and cosmetic taste in general your missions are to invade a ship or outpost to perform a certain task then escape once that objective is completed   monetization no you dont really need to spend money on the game  free to play more like free to pa oh wait no never mind seriously though you dont nothing with a direct impact on gameplay now literally nothing since you can get plat through the trade system requires you to spend real money on it though doing so may prove very convenient if you end up liking the game and playing for a while you may want to drop a few bucks to get some extra frame andor weapon slots you start with 2 slots for frames and 8 for weapons but aside from that you can grind out most of the noncosmetic stuff if you want to spend money on the game but are on a limited budget coupons for discounted platinum ranging from 20% 50% or 75% off will occasionally show up as a login reward and promo codes occasionally pop up for sale if you have spare rare modsprime parts that are in demand you can also fleece pubbies of their plat through the trade system and by spending intelligently a little platinum can go a long way dont be fooled by the prices of weapons and frames in the market the stuff youd want to spend money on is actually quite reasonably priced
recommended
this game makes you feel like a ninja and ninjas do play free
recommended
this game makes me want to tuck my  in whilst playing 1010

at first i have no idea what to do in this game all i do is keep on dying and using revive of course i am better now but still a beginner in warframe this game is pretty fun meaning i quite enjoy this type of hack n slash game as a newcomer this game is not friendlyuser enough or maybe too complicated to start hope the developer will work out on this overall rating is 710

forget the review scores i too thought this was a hopeless laginfected game back in the day but its come a long way silky smooth frantic gameplay gorgeous environments and an edgy scifi storyline that echoes eye divine cybermancy but plays like mass effect thrilling stuff get around it

i spawned then died 1010
recommended
its fun
recommended
been playing it for few days free game but with the usual you need to use real money to progress however it was balanced those who dont want to spend money can opt to grind which is not much of time consuming if done correctly good game with need of improvement particularly on the glitch and the usual complaint of failed to join session when opting to play with others
recommended
this game is fantastic can hardly believe this is free to play the controls are tight accurate and the theme is overall badass
recommended
lets get one thing perfectly clear the trailer for this game lies it does not actually represent the gameplay accurately and this is turning away many who would otherwise greatly enjoy it heres what the game is actually about you and up to three of your companions in highgrade military light power armor insert into a space station or groundside base that is procedurally generated with an objective you are outnumbered you are outgunned you are in unfamiliar terrain accomplish your objective by any means neccessary good luck
recommended
yes play this game its awesome and dont  about its pay to win it takes time good luck ^_^v

best game ever 10 out of 10
recommended
space ninjas nuff said if you want to know more wellthis is game is legit because it is constantly evolving the developers patch it almost every day new content delivered every wednesday livestreams from the developers every 2 weeks tonnes of content in the game the only thing it is missing is a story line
recommended
i must say that after a good portion of hours this game is great with a lot of stuff to do still i like it particularly for the uniqueness of the individual warframes and weapons despite there being a lot of them i also like the crafting system were you gather farm the materials needed some more difficultrare than others and then begin crafting usually taking about 12 hours for weapons to 3 days for warframes yeah it requires a bit of patience unless of course you choose to use their ingame market were you can get everything immediatly should you somehow feel a bit on your toes and have a good n fat wallet yeah i know its pay2win but who cares its mainly a pve game so its really only an advantage having someone on your team that likes spending money you also still have to level up everything when youve bought the stuff its only a way of skipping the crafting part of the game which can be tedious theres also plenty of maps consisting of plenty different game modes survival exterminate etc spread out on a lot of different planetsmoons in our very own solar system i havent really found out how many planetsmoons there are yet but im getting a feeling that there cant be many left overall really enjoying the game and i recommend everyone to give it a try  ps did i mention theres a whole pvp mode  1

its ok

holy crap 5 minutes 5 minutes into a mission was all i needed to know that i would love this game until the bitter end or my add kicked in wonderful 3rd person gameplay intensely stylized graphics and a rewarding and satisfying free2play experience so very often it seems that f2p means paytowin but not with this gem nope warframe will never beg a dime from you and you can live a very happy existence keeping it as free as the breeze you certainly can spend your monies on this game and buy dlc till youre opening up a second mortgage but the beauty to this beast is that you get a quality fun experience without ever feeling like you have to open up your wallet you do however owe something you owe yourself at least one playthrough i bet you wont entirely hate it disclaimer you may need a system that can handle all its bells and whistles
recommended
<updated review> >gets new pc >plays it >game looks beautiful ok instead mlg10 game rekt them all
recommended
even after 200 hours played i still cant wait to try out the next new thing another warframe or a new weapon each one feels sufficiently unique to keep the game fresh even after playing a lotl the thing people criticize is the farming and i absolutely agree i have neither the patience nor ambition to grind my way to whatever goal there is which is why i spent actual money on platinum and i dont regret it one bit yes you can play and achieve almost everything in the game without spending a penny and some people wear the fact that they never payed as a badge of honour personally i think that if a game gave me literally hundreds of hours of entertainment spending an amount that equates to the price of a regular game on this game is more than fair the developers need to live as well and in warframe they struck a good balance so that you never really feel pressured to buy platinum if you dont want to also once you have a littel platinum ready the trade system allows you to buy all kinds of stuff from other players for cheap so if you are ok with spending a few bucks in total you can get a good selection of mods and blueprints for very little money saving you the trouble of grinding
recommended
space ninjas what els do you need to know
recommended
warframe is a great game you can pick up and put down as you have time to play it it requires a lot of grinding type play but the rewards are easily achievable you are not required to purchase platinum but it is useful if you have a few dollars to spend the community is friendly and are usually happy to help new players get into the game
recommended
really good game there are still some bugs runs smooth even on an older computer optimized really great sad there isnt any crossplatform
recommended
this game is amazing so much content and a company that releases updates constantly and its free great story and background team work is a must the whole presentation is crisp and clear i would almost consider it out of beta must try this game not pay to win at all d

more like warfarmville straight up facebook game witht the 100 hour build  timer and the daily thing the fighting ight tho straight space ninja tha  hahah

warframe is a thirdperson shooter similar in style to mass effect 3s multiplayer component you and a squad of up to three other players take on missions throughout the solar system to acquire loot in order to take on tougher missions for better loot a variety of special powers and an almost comically large selection of weapons are available to aid you in your quest along with cards which modify the properties and abilities of your warframe and weapons notably the game does not have a cover system with the developers opting for faster gameplay this choice is further evidenced by the parkourlike elements of wallrunning and vaulting smoothly over ledges and containers the game is a work in progress with frequent updates aiming to resolve bugs refine mechanics and add content par for the course as freetoplay games tend to go i would like to see more context provided for the actions undertaken by players ingame and some players will be turned off by the grind necessary to craft additional warframes and weapons a few technical issues such as crashes and networking issues also afflict a minority of users though thankfully these seem to be isolated problems these slight criticisms have not stopped me from enjoying the considerable time ive spent with the game however bottom line warframe is a concentrated dose of wish fulfillment if you like the idea of being a space ninja this game will probably entertain you for at least a couple dozen hours if you like grinding for item upgrades it may hold your interest considerably longer for the entry price of free its easy to recommend at least giving it a spin
recommended
this is seriously one of the best games i have ever played simply put the game takes the best elements of mass effect 3s cooperative multiplayer and rolls it together with an extensive dungeon system of diablo could the game be better sure i literally cannot wait to see what sort of masterpiece it becomes when that happens for now though easily the best free to play game you could ask for 910
recommended
best free to play i have tried game has solid graphics and an outstanding coop gameplay
recommended
warframe is excellent for a free to play game the mission diversity is interesting and the diversity of weapons that are available keeps the game interesting however if you really want to have an enjoyable time you have to get orokin catylists for your weapons and orokin reactors for your warframes everything is balanced to be fightable against with those upgrades and anyone without them will be hardpressed to stay alive in the later levels that being said the game is fun and the diversity of playstyles is interesting the parkour system also adds a lot to the game and makes it so that if youre really good at it you do feel like a flippin ninja theyre constantly adding content worth playing
recommended
i love this game and i have no words at all i just love this game
recommended
warframe is a great game for those who enjoy scifi action almost alike ninja gaiden and mass effect and many of the other larger titles this game is fun and addictive and is also easy to play so you do not have to be some sort of elite gamer to play this the game will challenge your online social capabilities to work with other players to finish the objectives and gain that nice reward at the end wether it is a new unlockcurrency or a level or even all of the above if you enjoy playing ninja games and shooters then i strongly advise this game for those people it is something new and as i and alot of people have mentioned is still in beta though i can clarify worth the time and perhaps the money for the dlc side
recommended
i almost never write reviews but ive been gaming for over 30 years and few games have engaged me the way that warframe has this isnt a great free to play game its a great game period gameplay and character development are evrything you could ask for in a 3rd person scifi action rpg the story could be more fleshed out but im hoping thats something the developers flesh out in future updates if your wary of free to play like me id say this is one game where you should get over it iap isnt over bearing hear though i will say purchasing frames out right can be expensive but blueprints for evrything can be found or purchased with currency earned in game which i find to be more satisfying than just purchasing or finding the weapos i want so do yourself a favor and download it
recommended
love this game so addicted probably put 60 bucks into it lol
recommended
warframe has that inevitable mmo feature of draining all your time away but its awesome
recommended
really good game but it gets repetitive a little to fast good graphic good control good gameplay the community is a little too small for the game  gets repetitive fast
recommended
do you like to grind if yes then this game is the best game ever 1010 would grind again
recommended
currently one of the best f2p free to play games available right now warframe has top of the line graphics controls content dev team quality sound and even unusual lore this game has got everything going for it right now and no downside what so ever which is almost unheard of suffice it to say its doing right what 99% of the current gaming market is doing wrong its also in beta but for a beta product its more complete than most high end titles in the past 5 years or so also while the game does sell weapons and equipment in the cash shop it is usually far easier to obtain in game than the cash shop price which actually puts cash shop users at a near disadvantage how uncommon if all of this wasnt enough the rate at which updates are cranked out in nearly over polished form is quite amazing warframes cranked out more content updates changes balances new items armors maps and ai types than many high end mmos do in a year and they do it with a much smaller team too this game is a shinning example of what should be suffice it to say warframes cutting its own bloody path to true fame and glory among both f2p and p2p games alike this one is a definite must try for any scifi hack&slash or shooter fan easy 1010
recommended
this game is for u if u like action
recommended
an interesting game i shall say  crafting system coop play and many more fun details
recommended
good for burmese players since its a freetoplay game with nice coop shooting gameplay the drawback is the gameplays repetitive and you have to pay to reduce wasting your time grinding more warframes items and weapons other than that you can get almost all items  edit gonna play on ps4 still bad that i cant import my character from pc to ps4 
recommended
a must have game
recommended
one of the best free to play games out there
recommended
awesome game lots of grinding but thats the fun of it all meeting new players or having fun with a group of friends f2p only charging for cosmetics as everything else is craftablebe patient it can take up days to craft some items overall an 8910 in my book solid gameplay plenty of cool weapons and warframes to give a try just dl it and play already 
recommended
outstanding level of fun and awesomeness on a f2p game nothing such as p2w exists for this one what else could you ask for
recommended
basically you are a homicidal semimercenary parkour space ninja and you murder your way across the solar system it is also freetoplay for these reasons it is almost certainly worth some of your time
recommended
this is a fast paced 3rd person shooter in the short time i have been playing this game there have been 2 major updates both have improved the game play and longevity of the game i have enjoyed both of the live events i was able to participate in generally this is a game where you are going to have to experiment with different warframes  classes and wepon combinations to find your happy place once you learn the intricacies of useing and powering up the mods for your warframes and weapons you are sure to have some fun this is a free to play game with a cash shop but never fear you can find most everything other than cosmetic items through game play
recommended
amazing game that makes me wet
recommended
a great game overall
recommended
im really liking this game and its still only on beta 
recommended
it is good yummy
recommended
this game takes a bit to get used to but with friends it can be alot of fun as well
recommended
while it is not without its share of bugs and need for improvement this game has come a long way and will continue to active community in the forums really is helping shape this game to what the players want the devs listen while grindy and repetitive i still strongly reccomend this game constant updates and content make it possible to always have goals

this game is awesome
recommended
the movement system is a bit off but the rest of the game is pretty fun if you dont mind the grind
recommended
this is a stellar f2p game very fluid looks great gets you hooked just like a well made game should thanks digital extremes this is a great game my only quarrel is the market pricing seems a bit off some things seem to expensive or too cheap for the effort involved in building vs buying
recommended
warframe is a great way of playing some f2p 3rd person shooter action warframe is still in beta and it seems that the devs are happy to take on board advice from the fans so hopefully a few of the details that could use polish still have a chance to be completed with the price of entry a flat nothing it would be a shame to miss out on quite a bit of fun to be had here

this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

its like a real life girlfriend only far less expensive and easier to grind

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

nine out of tenno

really good game mechanics great community lots of grinding

an amazing game with very good content storyline may not make sense but the game graphics and how the game works is very interesting people who love to farm will like this game
recommended
one of the better over the shoulder shooters ive played
recommended
this is an addicting free to play rpgfps with a deverse weapon selection and great matchmaking with hundreds of new people to play with every day
recommended
amazing game to play a bit repititive but the game is still young and is going through alot of changes but for the time beingthe game keeps itself interesting thanks to the coop gameplay which emphasizes upon actual teamworkotherwise youd get ripped apart by the on coming masses what keeps me addicted to itis that it remains challenging no matter how much you grind and on a half serious note youre a ninja with a huge selection of tools from a sword and an assualt rifle to a heavy hammer with a bow and arrow peace

try this game and stick with it for 12 weeks before deciding if you like the game i really do like this game the graphics are awesome the gameplay fast furious and wrapped in good artistic style and the gore isjolly good highly recommended if you like coop game and or action game the only gripe is platinums are a bit overpriced though redeemingly you do not need themt to craft anything in game except to buy slots for your weapons and warframesarmored suits
recommended
amazing game tons of replay value outstanding end game content the game kinda lacks customization but the story makes up for it 100%
recommended
one of the 1 free games on steam

well i wouldnt have 300hrs on record if it wasnt good beatifull game good community user friendly no p2w and a lot of fun when playing coop with friends 1010

i dont know why i like it but i find my self very attracted to this game
recommended
it ing sucks  so i recomend it
recommended
highly recomend this game to anyone who likes fast paced action generous f2p games and a nice upgrade system the game can get a bit grindy at times though
recommended
this game is really awesome  however its a grind game so if you dont like collecting items and re playing maps this is probably not the game for you its a 4 player mission coop game you find blueprints craft new weaponsframes and levelup to get stronger so that you can advance to new arias anyways like it a lot heck its a free 2 play game  give it a try   rating 7  10 steves  gaming feel  repetitive gameplay
recommended
great game unfortunately once your are a top tier i am level 16 i am not sure with everything fully leveled you can even get to 17 yet the game loses a lot of zest the devs have nerfed the unique role based frames into warsame the loadout matters thats it if you have good mods and are a reasonable player you only need a handfull of guns and melee weapons even amongst the prime weapons they are not all end game weapons many of them are just meh i have a braton prime that has been formaed 7 times its still  comapred to the soma or bolter prime grinding orokin runs in the void the rng is complete  running a mission 40 times to get a lex prime part and still not getting is is rediculous according to devs working as intended i guess if they want me to spend money and time elsewhere then yeah its working as intended i could go on and on its a good game but they need to make some reasonable changes like a loot selector after so many runs a real functional difference think old frost or ember in theory trinity frames should matter more than guns but fact is they just done its a good game needs some love welcome to warsame

amazing its free why not try it
recommended
fast paced shooter fun and pretty addictive the graphics can be boosted to oustanding levels and its one of the best free to play games so far i would reccommend this game to anyone
recommended
fantastic game hard to get into though because everything revolves around completion rate material drop rate and lots of time to build everything but other than that i highly recommend it
recommended
despite of all ingame bugs that sometimes trouble me i think this game is a very wellmade free to play game i dont really like third person shooter but this this game is very challenging it makes me want to play it again and again it challenges your brain to really think which step should you take while you proceed your mission and i totally recommend this game for any people who likes tps for a free to play game this is a magnificent tps game
recommended
started out good but is kinda pay to win now which is too bad
recommended
great free2play game

its a tear jerking story of how a war picture was framed

mass effect with ninjas 9510
recommended
pros its free very fun good graphics cons waiting two days for a warframe to be built and weapons common really two days feels very repetitive no story line to the boss colors are not earned other thoughts should of had a premuim unlock so when we buy something there is no waiting time for warframes and weapons instead of rushing with platinum  have colors all unlocked and premium should never go away only to be bought once
recommended
awesome artwork and addictive yet fun gameplay the storybackground is fun and the dynamic events and alerts are unique and interesting there really isint any paywall after you start to level up your warframes and weapons and explore the games extremely large ecosystem and complex crafting trading and modding elements i would recommend throwing a couple bucks towards the game to get a sentinel early and its a cool indie company have fun with world of warframe 
recommended
this game is awesomeyou guys should try it
recommended
great game to play with friends or by yourself
recommended
great game
recommended
fun with friends repetitive levels and will get boring
recommended
by any objective measure its terrible but i cant help but have fun doing stupid flips and shooting nameless grunts with ridiculous guns and then i get stuff to build more ridiculous guns to shoot nameless grunts with very much onenote but its a note that tickles something deep in my lizard brain starting out kinda sucks though the upgrade system your primary way of getting more powerful is poorly explained and the essential mods arent parceled out to new players starter gear is almost universally terrible so it can take a while to get going by the time youre zipping around with a grappling hook and blasting apart mooks with a rocket launcher that shoots exploding acid your crappy newbie rifle will be but a distant memory buy a braton not a braton mk1 from the marketplace as soon as you can it is an upgrade in every way the storefront is kinda whack platinum the realmoney currency prices are all over the place weapons and warframes tend to be extremely overpriced even if youre only buying platinum at a 50% or greater discount but orokin reactors and catalysts very important but limited items arent too expensive and with the trading system you can pick up the essential mods for about a quarter each the rest of your plat will likely go toward buying inventory slots fortunately everything except inventory slots is available without paying real money the crafting system seems like a huge multipart grindfest but once you get in the habit of collecting materials while youre doing missions for other reasons youll end up with a surplus of resources warframe is very generous with free content a small amount of cash $8 in my case and a bit of frugality will get you everything youll ever need content comes thick and fast major updates hit about every two and a half months with smaller updates in between dropping new equipment and special events  if you enjoy the basic gameplay then warframe will give you no end of goals to achieve by parkouring through hallways and murdering bad guys if you dont enjoy the basic gameplay then its not gonna change drastically try it out pick mag as your starter see what the fuss is about
recommended
ok so lets be honest this game is probably one of the best looking free to play game there is out there with so much new content there is no reason not to download this game so remember ninjas play free lets do this
recommended
set in the far reaches of outer space during a new dark age warframe introduces the tenno a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the grineer for centuries this game is very addicting play as a space ninja running around throwing energy and running up walls defend against a ton of different mobs grind for hours and craft new weapons and frames the community is awesome and the gameplay is amazing i would highly recommend this and we havent even touched on the graphics the only problem i can think off is that the dlc is overpriced just my opinion otherwise this game is 1010
recommended
one of the most fair freetoplay models around pretty much everything can be aquired at an extremely reasonable pace and with only slight effort
recommended
this game is fun this game is cool id reccommend it to anyone who wants to kill in style please note if steam sees this message i am hating how it isnt in my libary i spent money it isnt their but anyway let the killing begin and note if you strugle in the game never fear to ask for help its more immportaint around the time you are getting stalked by the stalker
recommended
freetoplay thats actually free its awesome 4 player coop constant developer updates and new content wanna be a space ninja this is the game for you try it now
recommended
one of the best games iev ever played on the other side it costs you a lots of time
recommended
the reason i tried this game is because its constantly in the top 15 most played steam game list i was skeptical about its popularity at first but it was soon dissipated when i started playing the basics classes are warframes each frame has three components you can collect from boss drops at the end of the boss level its rather fast to collect these components no need to buy them from the real money market in which the frames are quite expensive to buy there is no real need for that most weapons can be bought with ingame credits from the market and built with resources gained in game again no need to buy with real money there are some end game weapons  frames that can be collected from end game content you cant buy them in the market the frames and weapons are augmented with mods which are dropped in game they give stat changes such as increased damage fire rate reload speed health etc mods can be combined with other mods such as duplicates to the same mod to increase their level which increases their potency and the cost of using the mod the higher the level of the frame  weapon the more mods you can augment it with the only things worth spending money on are frame and weapon inventory slots which are quite cheap then after that there is an item that can supercharge a frame  weapon gives you more space for mods which can be obtained in game but is quite rare then there are cosmetics items which are purely optional i got about 1800 plantinum for $25 after 20 weapons and 4 frames and some cosmetics i only used up 400 plats the missions are randomly generated at the end of each mission you collect ingame credits mods and resources you can alternate between your primary rifle shotgun sniper secondary pistol throwing knives or melee swords dual swords heavy the movement is fluid you can wall walk slide slide jump slide spin attack leap attack etc it makes you feel fast and like an assassin after 70 hours in game id say this game is ninja with gunsswords in space a thirdperson diablolike item collection game although repetitive when played in coop can be quite satisfying mowing down large amount of enemies
recommended
pretty fun game but it can get monotonous and grindy if you play solo overall you should give it a try
recommended
incredible fastpaced and addictive if youre tired of an endless string of nearidentical covershooters this is for you the acrobatics are incredible and the action unrelenting try it out today
recommended
this is one of the best games i have ever played and its free to play 
recommended
this is one of the best freetoplay games out in the market possibly the best and has a quality level both in production and gameplay that rivals and oftentimes surpasses that of aaa games with the constant updates the game is ever changing evolving and if it ever gets boring it wont be for long as an update is soon to come and spice things up again the gameplay is unrivaled you wont find anywhere else a thirdperson shooter with a combat this deep fastpaced complex and with as much mobility as this one the promise is and im really dumbing it down playing as cyber ninjas in space and ho boy does it ever deliver i can guarantee that 90% of the complaints going around about this game are biased andor uninformed i can understand if this game is not your cup of tea for whatever reason but if it is its definitely a mustplay for it is nothing short of a masterpiece
recommended
surprisingly addictive game fun weapons the warframes are unique and interesting to use and theres quite a bit to do downsides aggressive pay system some resources and items are nearly impossible to get without purchasing them with platinum rng is completely whack for certain mods etc no real end game content so a good game that could become great if the developers put out some real end game content and lighten up on trying to force people into buying platinum
recommended
supreme graphics d ultra gameplay d its optimized very good for pc so you dont need to worry about the game lagging 
recommended
great game with a really active dev team would recommend to everyone everywhere
recommended
i gotta say i loved the beta
recommended
one of the best f2p out there always growing and improving based on the communitys feedback a ust have in your library
recommended
i enjoy this game immensly the mod strategy is a very interesting concept that allows for some strange combos and with damage 20 it got only better
recommended
i read many game reviews before i started to play since i was very unsure about it and most of them were not even close to the reality this freemium shooter rocks yes you really have to play nothing if you dont want to and even if you do it you gain no advantage over the others you just can get stuff earlier and faster or its stuff which is unimprtant to gameplay like colors skins if you choose to invest money you dont have to invest big amounts but you still can the game even provides a sign in lottery where you can get up to 75% rewards for ther ingame currency called platinum you get 50 platinum for free  dont waste them buy weapon slots with them since slots for weapons warframes and sentinels are good to have so you can own more stuff and most other things you get from playing alerts for potatoes actually orokin reactors and catalysts which double the slots of you warframe weapons and sentinels and much other stuff are verry important but you dont have to miss them since the game provides an app called warframe nexus which keeps you updated events while still beta there are already events which are diffrent and fun and are mostly are yoused to get new stuff into the game taking part you can get unique stuff general at first it takes time to get into it you can do more with your warframe then in most fps so you will need to learn how it works until you master it if you just want to turn it on and shoot some npc in the face or chop them into pieces you can easily do it without much preparation but you can also join up to one of the may clans out there play 4 man coop with voicecomms to reach higher goals in the gameladders or else to make it clear its a beta but if you play it it doesnt feel like it until they change nerv buffthings radically so dont get angry its still beta my 2 cents are that it is one of the best and most fair freemium games out there if you liked that become a weaponed to the teeth space ninja
recommended
basically diablo 4 w bill roper as lead designer goty every year
recommended
tis a good game with its pros and cons the pros is painfully obvious you get to murder fascist griiner greedy corpus and numerous soft skinned infested with many tools at your disposal it become very fun indeed combining unique weapon and tools to suit your gameplay but like other games it has its downsides the most major is connection issue this game uses listen server which means there is no central hub server but more like long range lan if you have many friends play this game with you im very reccommend it but if you more of a solo player getting random party expect serious lag issues verdict 7310
recommended
let me be clear on this this game is endless grind its also can be pay2win or at least pay2bestrong but on the other level its freaking awesome space ninjas space weapons teamplay wall running huge bosses its still in beta but its extremely good for a free game the balance in this game is averagely good there are some popular things but anything except your starting gun i think can perform decently if properly modded since its a pve game there is pvp but theres nothing good i can say about it except that it is there theres no need in perfect balance and you probably can choose your first warframe based on aesthetics  it will perform good if you master it there are none completely bad waframes the only con i think is that around 60% of all warframe abilities fall off at the endgame and the said endgame is mostly higher numbers on enemy stats which is a bit disappointing and theres no final goal as you see it but if you arent going to invest thousands of dollars into this game you will probably spend more than a thousand hours getting all the stuff supermaxed or quit trying overall very good pve f2p game 610 if you are not going to pay and 810 if you are going to the most essential things to buy are weapon and warframe slots for new weapons and warframes respectively potatoes orokin catalysts and reactors which improve modding capabilities they can be farmed for but they are so rare that its just better to buy them all other things except for aesthetics of course cxan be obtained through missions
recommended
fantastic free to play game that is gorgeous i have put over 30 hours into this game and have yet to feel the need to put real money into it so it does not seem to be pay to win although it is an option to pay for more powerful weapons and such learning curve is a little steeper than other games which may deter new players but if you stick with it you will actually feel like a skilled space ninja

best game i ever play very fun with friend

this game is really fun and easy to learn if any one want some i help just ask me d

warframe is a special type of game as compared to other games there are few games that will make you fell quite as much of a badass at level one before abruptly reminding you that well youre just that level 1 with your little rifle and weak armour then as you work your way up from there you begin to fell that badassness from day 1 creeping back up your spine youve finally crafted your own weapon and are slaughtering endless waves of enemies with it while your teammates in your imagination anyway stand there in awe of your awesome power warframe is a very interesting experience it doesnt have any pay to win mechanism but more of a pay to shot theings fast mechanism the fact that you can most probably with the right set of friends play the game from level 1 till youve finished mnost of the game so far without spending any money at all is a good sign the item crafting can get a bit tedious sending oyu off to systems that you quite frankly are affraid of you will find that that sweet joy of finally crafting a weapon to your likeness or finding out that the weapon you just spent hours crafting if of no use whatsoever can be almost enjoyable the story and the quests following a sort of space ninja group known as the tenno is slightly watered out to make way for all the awesome looking graphics and weaponspew pew all the way but that isnt saying that the story is weak not at all i have found myself at some points almost talking to the lotusthe ai entity that will guide you through the game and its heavy reliance on cooperative play i tried single player died on every mission makes you sometimes feel a bit depressed as you sit staring at the mission you want to play while the next wave of players steadily approaches all in all warfarme is a very balanced game although the paytoshootthingsfastermechanic can get quite annoying no game is perfect right

this is a really epic game

i have to say this game is amazing its primarily free but its so good it makes me want to buy one of the packs which i will be the gameplay is fun customization makes combat unique and advancing tzhe game constantly provides a challenging experience and the visuals are great if mass effect and metal gear made love and had a child warframe would be that child
recommended
this is basically a mix of thirdperson action ninjas parkour advanced tech and awesomeness highly recommended

this game has a bit of a grind other than that its pretty good

710 if it wasnt for the insainly long patch downloads i would probably play this game more often really fun if you are into grinding the same missions to get your favorite warframe like i have
recommended
this gamei dont know where to start on update 13 it was a great game it had its bugs and its flaws but it was fun to play but with the new update it has improved a lot its beautiful even though the wait was a pain in the  it was worth it it almost feels like a brand new game i dont understand some people that hate this new update so much i simply cant hate it in any way the new tutorial is fantastic  compared with the   tutorial of before if you can call that a tutorial  it shows new players how to play properly and gives you diversity in your first guns depending in your style its great to see the implementation of your own ship and how you control everything in a more fluid way some may say that its less practical but theese people are hayterz just kidding before you could be overwhelmed by all the different stuff that was presented to you all at once  foundry arsenal etc  and it was tricky for me to get the hand of the game now you are showed what you are doing instead of waching some slides that show you what you do they make you do missions to get parts for your ship and guide you through lots of things that are a little complicated for a new tenno its also good to see that theres an actual quest line instead of complete this planet to go to the other planet and so on it looks more fun this way and makes a little more sense there is a lot of work to be done into this game to make it perfect but this was a big step into creating one of the best games that in my opinion will ever come across steam

warframe is the best free2play game i have ever played not only is it a fun game that is constantly getting new content and features as it is in open beta right now but it is the best free2play model i have ever seen in a game like most f2p games it has an in game earned moneytype credits and a paid for type platinum in warframe every single item can be obtained without spending platinum the only exception to this is vanity items and room for more warframes and weapons but you can actually earn platinum to buy those things through the trading system if you have something rare you can trade it to other people in exchange for platinum the developers also have a very active role in the community they have livestreams every week and are active on the games forums instead of seeing the developers as more of an atm for games than anything else ea for example you see them as people who actually want to make a great game overall this is a fantastic system and has actually encouraged me to spend money on the game not because i have to in order to do well in it but because i want to support the growth of this fantastic game

would recommend a very fun pve game with lots of costumization options and it gets updates very often it may get repetitive due to levels being fairly similar but additions are being made rapidly overall a really nice free game to pick up if youve got a few minutes to download it
recommended
probably the best online game released to date and ever expanding constant new content being added weekly and plenty of fun to go around it definetly will not disappoint you

recommended
so what can i say its free to play loads of fun whether its with random players friends or just solo graphics are pretty good and the missions are extremely fun i would recommend you getting this game why not its f2p

beware tenno your ability to be a true space ninja might be greatly hampered warframe is a free to play third person shooter with light rpg elements thats a whole lot of things but what it boils down to is this you are a tenno a secret race of space ninjas awakened by the lotus to bring back peace in the galaxy you do this by operating warframes warframes are combat suits and have different combat capabilities at the start you must choose from three different frames the missions themself are fairly straight forward things like exterminate rescue and defense are your standard fair in these kind of games the weapons are fun to use and more unlock as you gain higher ranks this game is an absolute blast with 2 or more friends 4 people per mission and really soaks up hours without you noticing it not everything is right in the land of space ninjas however questionable dlc and design choices might have you wonder if investing your time is really worth it let me begin by saying that pretty much everything you can acquire ingame can also be bought with real life money converted into platinum this might seem alright on paper but the prices for these weapons warframes and other items are questionable then again you could also forego this and just grind yourself to a better place in the space ninja ranks another thing that hampers the experience is the slew of bugs still present while the development team has been pretty consistent with bugfixes there are still issues with things and the dev team has a tendency of bringing back old bugs on accident while they had been fixed a couple of patches ago your experiences may vary with others but be prepared last but not least is the music if you like a game with a good soundtrack this one is not for you theres only a small amount of tracks and they are all rather dull to listen to youre better off building your own soundtrack for this game if all these lowpoints havent scared you off id suggest you try it out the game is free to play after all
recommended
a pretty fun free to play third person shooter taking place in corridors of space stations and planetside colonies each suit warframe has different abilities to mix and match and theres a wide variety of guns and melee weapons to collect and level up the movement is fun and the wallrunning rolling dodging sprinting all feel fun to pull off and look pretty cool to boot there are fairly regular major updates and the level layouts  although using a lot of the same assets  are somewhat randomly generated as to keep the gameplay from getting too stale however to obtain the higher level gear takes ages collecting materials and crafting or for you to pony up some cash to just buy them its grindy as all hell if youre going for the end game experience and dont want to shell out for high level gear but its still a fun time killer that you dont have to pay for if you dont want to
recommended
great game especially for a f2p you dont need spend money to enjoy or advance in this game everythings pretty much available through plans to assemble items and mats are quite easily farmed in game varied missions and goals mobs and boss fights the addictive part is leveling your character and its weapons
recommended
this games worth a shot

i didnt think id like a 3rd person sooter at firest but im thourougly hooked
recommended
recommended for group players grinders stealthers i paid into this game very early on and i was glad to see it find its way to steam the exciting dynamic of this game is imo its main draw it is exciting and fun to play this game the number of tactical variances is staggering aside from the brute force approach in my experience most maps can be stealthed by that i mean goals approached w minimal enemy threat drawn incremental advance seems the most useful but ymmv a good group of tennos can go very far and i think this a good weekly game for clansfriendsgroups if not daily also i like the item affinity progression this game meets my requirements for a viable freetoplay game
recommended
amazing game after hard working and spending hours the game is really cool and fun i recommend for all people who has patience and love space ninjas d
recommended
one of the best free to play games out there a third person shooterhack&slash and an awesome coop and pvp mode sponsored by nvidia with great graphics and 97% of the content you can have it without paying real money the other 3% is just cosmetic i would recommend this to anyone this is how free to play games should be made d
recommended
i just keep coming back to this one its a mainly cooperateive first person shooter with a strong rpg element it seems simple at first but theres considerable depth to the progression and clan play plus the fps mechanic is fast solid and fun really didnt expect to like it as much as i do two thumbs up from me
recommended
one of the best f2p games ive played in a long time it has its bad moments but all games do definitely stick with this game you wont regret it
recommended
absolutely fantastic and addicting game the use of the mod system is genious it allows for multiple different gameplay styles for the same character warframe
recommended
definitely a fun game for people into thirdperson action type games 33
recommended
probably one of my favourite freetoplay games
recommended
fun but alot of  to learn
recommended
i started playing the game cause my friend told me to i started playing it and it was fun i rate this game a 9 out of 10
recommended
wonderful thirdpersonshooter based on stelth and guns you are a ninja in space so yea the end no in warframe running up walls and on the roof are common being shot run up walls then end with a back flip or as i like to call it matrix mode
recommended
great game lots of content frequent updates and free login rewards has some bugs but what game doesnt overall its a solid game 230 hours on ps4 and 40 on pc and love every minute of it
recommended
this game is amazing there is little a time that i get on a game everyday and see something new going on not to mention the forge where have to work to assemble your gear
recommended
this is a very enjoyable game but you have to be carefull if your used to making small purchases in games like this i went from telling myself that i would spend no more than 60 dollars on platinum to having spent a few hundred dollars on this game over the course of the time ive been playing it
recommended
cool cause ninjas and space now all we need is pirate no we have those too
recommended
update failed some content could not be dowloaded from our servers please restart warframe to try again the update will restart shortly whew thats what it is saying all day  plz fix this problem this game looks toooooo cool
recommended
amazing movement and combat system unlike any before but does cost money eventually no matter what and will need to have its finishing quality added the character leveling and custimization is great but once you realize theres not much more to do once you have a couple warframes and a good couple levels up you realize all of the work you put into making a badass godlike superhero ninja is only to continue puting more time and money into each character and there is never any sort of player to player recognition for your time invested in your character games like world of warcraft have all of the intricate mini parts of the game like warframe but no matter what you get tangled up in you always know grand total the game is still alliance vs hordeprimarily and warframe and its creators needs to finish with its own distinguished main reason to play the game something that makes you take all the time you spend making your guy just as awsome as you want him and then actually lets you use him for a purpose other then more leveling or material farming my vote is for hundreds of warframes to eventually meet in head on 360 degree warfare in online servers on the supposed new part of the game control points weapons and warframes would be great
recommended
the game is fun and has a bit of innovation its free to play aspect gives players a free way to play and you really dont need to buy anything for it is it worth paying sure you can get things you want like in any game however this isnt a mmo many people i talked to say it is its a coop game where people have the option of hop in hop out features the things i dont like about the game is it is linear you have minimal options on where you can roam the game play is repeatitive and i know most games are like that but this game really has nothing but the same sword slashing and gun slinging as any other game i ever played for a free to play it is fun but even the levels lack creative imagination they look like theyre basically the same level over and over again players well you get good and bad players for all games but the ones on here will leave in the middle of a session and leave you to fight hoardes of enemies by yourself and they lack the consideration to revive you when you die i give it a thumbs up for a free to play game however if it was a pay to play game or even a game to purchase i wouldnt recommend it
recommended
this is a great 3rd person shooter game that is not to be missed out on especially considering the creators are kind enough to hand out such an awesome game for free
recommended
very fun and addiciting
recommended
what to say about a game thats just funfrom the begining i really enjoyed it the dynamics of this game make it diffrent it has been more fun than any shooter i have played in the past and i would definatly recommend it to others but with a word of warning to them that it can be adictive and hard to put down lol the graphics of this game make it seem like your really there and on top of that can be adjusted pretty good for those with slower machines without dropping the quality too much the game could use a bigger player base and possibly an ingame broker type system but other than that i really have nothing bad to say about this game the landscapes are quite beautiful and the indoor facilities are quite nice to explore the weapons on his game are great i wish i had one of each of them and the audio for them are perfect the audio for the environmental is great too nothing like what i have experianced in the past the designers of this game have done a fantastic job of making this game and i plan to play it for a really long time 
recommended
lets play this awesome
recommended
cool game
recommended
fun to play very addicitve
recommended
it was the best halo i everplayed
recommended
this is a fun game 
recommended
great game with a friendly community
recommended
quite the grindfest but still enjoyable nonetheless has a lot of different abilities and items to collect and level making customization another strong part of the game the game can be played without spending any money however the largest roadblock is the limited number of slots for storing weapons and warfarmes classes one needs to spend real money to unlock these slots however the slots are reasonably priced and i am happy to support the developer the game is continually changing and having new content added it is still in beta so we dont know if the developer will put forth the same effort once the game is released overall ive had a lot of fun with warframe even though it does get repetitive

so epic game ever i play  d

is awsome but beware the bright lights of explosions and death

this game is just awesome a frre to play tps with lot of action and great combo system you can customise your character with different color armour and skins it is the same for weapons i recommend this game to everyone it totally worth it d
recommended
if you like to play thirdperson shooter with awesome rpg elements with 3 other people and in a scifi setting this is for you seriously give this game a try its free
recommended
great game with loads of playtime the only problem with it is its highly repetitive there is no real end game the whole point is to upgrade to better equipment but after a while you have it all and are left waiting for the next patch to provide something new to farm an possibly never use even with that this thing is amazing for a group of friends or even solo attempting to stealth every misson can provide months of fun the graphics assuming you have the capability to run on hig ae amazing even at low rendering
recommended
if you got time this is the best f2p third person shooteraction game out there market is expensive but almost everything can be obtained by playin the game laking real end game content is its main downside at the moment you can quickly obtain most end game items by grinding it for a couple of days or buying it off the player market for in game currency or trade items you have collected the rng will make you come back for more or turn you completly off
recommended
i can easily say this is the best f2p game ive ever played discounting tf2 the gameplay is fun its fast paced and tricky your character moves in amazing ways with awesome parkour combat can be a little dull at times due to just having lame guns for a while to start but the melee combat is excellent all in all its free it looks great and it plays great rally some friends and give it a shot if youre bored oh and you can be like raiden
recommended
1010 would play

ninjas in space ing rpg nade launcher rocket pistols energy beams mind control and rocket powered hammers and explosions damn this game is so good best f2p i have ever played
recommended
dis game started days after it went into open beta was stable as if it were a final version commercial release absolutely wonderful to play with friends although the objective fun in it is in setting your sights on a new warframe and working towards it with 13 frames theres a lot of work ahead for you to keep you busy and it doesnt require too much money to get you those 11 extra slots
recommended
i dont like the game but there is no reason you shouldnt like it
recommended
an epic 3rd person shooter that envolves space ninjas i mean come on space ninjas you have about 8 warframes to choose from each with a unique play style and abilities i recommend this game to anyone who likes scifi adventures and anyone who likes ninjasin space
recommended
although this game does get extremely repetitive i find this to be a brilliant game why community  most games that i have played or even heard about has got a bad annoying community with people raging whining and trolling however this game has a freindly community with people that will respond and have a bant  i do think that this mught be due to the fact of the game not being pvp and that you are able to be op updates  i love it when a game does recent updates with new items and this game does this precisely with new equipment weapons warframes and missions most people will never get bored always being busy  warframe doesnt really have a objective so you need to make your own which is what i love but some might not this might be from farming xp to trying to get a rare mod what annoys me slow  having to constantly go to the same mission to get new materials or mods is the most annoying thing for me grinding to get the things you want can bore you or make you determined to get what you want ive been trying to go from rank 6 to rank 8 for 2 weeks now and still working on it which is a  but i am determined to get there plus it makes time fly repetitive  for the game being slow to start with the game can get very boring as it will be repetitive having the same maps as well get boring as you want every map different for a new experiance which could make the game short for some costing  for me i am unable to put money in a game so i want to be cautous of what i buy however the market of waframe is very expensive which would put alot of people off i deffinitly would not call this game free to play as you would easily spend 40 quid in a short time luckily most items can be made with credits and materials can be found in and after missions overall i have been playing this game for a long time and i love it this is definitly a game for people who always want to be busy determined and who want a nice comminity

this game is alot of fun and quite addictive when you get into it the game is constantly being butchered to death balance wise by its developer though there are also a ton of bugs and really strange design choices that wonder if the people in charge are mentally handicapped or have actually ever played any video games before great game overall though just be prepared for bugs bugs and more bugs be prepared for things being nerfed when they dont need to be and things that do need to be nerfed being left alone

a fun 4 player coop game that is relatively easy to understand been a favourite amongst my friends and i for a while now would recommend the gameplay is wonderful bringing together elements from thirdpersonshooters rpgs and mmos and combining them into something new the graphical design is nothing short of beautiful dazzling the players with a variety of levels and effects the audio quality is great there is nothing nicer than hearing the drums of war start to play rhythmically as you enter battle finally the community is large diverse and friendly
recommended
devs are very focused on their community and adding new content been playing the game a while now and theres still plenty to do basically imagine star wars battlefrontninjaslots of gun costomizationlots of live events and mission types
recommended
warframe is an 3rd person shooter  hack n slash the game is grindy like monster hunter since you will have to grind for materials to make stuff if you log enough hours into it though a lot of materials no longer need to be grinded for the game also has a bit of a learning curve and can be difficult for newer players due to how weak the starting weapons can be and that new players dont have mods to really help boost their weapons another downside for newer players is the wait time on crafting weaponswarframes weapons take 1224 hours to craft and a warframe takes 12 hours per part and 24 hours for the final product to make you also only start off with 2 warframe slots and about 10 weapons slots i know the above statement is very negative but it is to let readers that are new to the game look at what they are getting involved with now besides those negative points the game is very very good for new players they give you 50 platinum which is the real life currency this allows you buy some useful things such as a reactor or catalyst or a warframe slot or weapon slots in the game you also never have to put on actual currency since you can get catalyst reactors and helmets can be obtained from alerts you can also make every warframe and weapon excluding event and founders equipment you can also get the real life currency by trading certain mods and prime partsblueprints to other players the game features a lot of weapon types and the endgame weapons are expanding so that there are becoming more weapons that hold up in late game survivaldefenses so it isnt just one weapon to use later there are becoming many options this game is in a beta state and is changing so what is good now good be mediocre a month from now what is top tier could get overshadowed later and other things may change
recommended
amazing graphics that dont kill a computer
recommended
ok so i have played this game for awhile i have a pretty poor attention span so any game i play for 500 hours as of time of writing is pretty special its is a bit slow at the start to get upgrades but after a couple days of playing you will be able to get multiple weapons and war frames a day if you desire netcode is pretty good multiplayer coop is seamless and stress free unless your trying to play with specific friends it can occasionally give failed to join errors or such you can certainly enjoy this game without spending any money on it after playing for 500 hours though i dont mind spending some
recommended
its f2p and loads of fun

i dont like spreading my opinion too much but seriously look how long i played this i can almost asure you that you will enjoy this game what isnt there to like about it third person ninjas cool weapons acrobatics robots modified humans killer fractions and beautiful graphics like i said this is my opinion and shouldnt be taken too seriously just try the game first its free after all

after playing for a year i can say that this game is amazing but it still needs impovement so expect some things to happen
recommended
one of the best free to plays on steam
recommended
some very very beautiful and fun scifi action it took a bit for me to get used to the 3rd person but the pace of the action is awesome
recommended
theres really no point in writing anything creative here everyone else already covered all the bases look at the other reviews all i can say is this really is a great game and you should get some friends together and play it its best when you have friends or family who play with you and voicechat via skype or steam chat this game can get kinda grindy for some and it does for me too but that doesnt stop me from coming back the staff members are phenomenal quickly fixing issues from recent updates with a patch within minutes they dont have that im in this to get every cent out of you that i can while giving nothing in return feel either they encourage players to buy cash with coupons as daily login rewards which in my opinion was worth every penny i spent on it  tldr  this is the first and only game in 8 years of playing f2p mmo games ive ever actually spent any money yes its that good
recommended
pretty fun and fun to play with friends nothing can compare to what this game plays like and the setup

warframe space ninjas with parkour and grinding abound this game does many thing for my inner space ninja that aside the story line seems to be a bit lacking however i still find the game rather entertaining with good friends
recommended
ill try and keep this short when i started playing warframe i never expected it be a truly freetoplay game it was only after 40hours of aimlessly grinding the first 4 planets that i figured out how to play this game progress and become stronger i realised after becoming bored with my weak starter gear and building a ton of new ones to try out for  and giggles that crafting your first few weapons is what gets you out of the frustration zone the game was almost instantaneously opened up to me especially after upgrading my newly crafted gear and i now found the gameplay to be quite satisfying and fun i started to become more skilled at playing and was offered a spot in several clans i picked one and found its members to be some of the most helpful people out there and i quickly learned how to trade some of my stuff how to find rare and valuable items and how to properly prepare my equipment for each mission it wasnt long before i had enough platinum to purchase my first cosmetic upgrades and extra slots for weapons and warframes dropping into a mission next to a friend and catching their reaction when they see your hardearned individuality  the alternative helmet the syandana the new vibrant colour scheme and the intricately detailed weapons  is a hugely satisfying experience i cant describe  its even more satisfying to make their day by telling them you havent spent a single cent on the game there are constant updates to this game that fix bugs balance current content and add new content for you to enjoy and its not slowing down it continues to grow and grow and become more amazing just about every week giving it a rather polished feel for an open beta its going to be huge one day and theres no reason that you shouldnt play this and be a part of its amazing development tldr dont listen to people who say this game is pay to win they are simply stuck in the same place i was in they want to progress and platinum deals are becoming more and more tempting with each passing day as they struggle to find the answer that is literally staring them right in the face i could go into detail about how the ingame trading channel can you make enough platinum to buy anything you want for absolutely none of your cash at all but i did promise i would try keep this short  so give this game a try get involved in everything it offers and really go for it i mean who doesnt wanna be a badass spaceninja of untouchable epicness thats a huge plus right 1110

a seriously fun game if you have the patience to repeatedly do missions to gather materials for better weapons

best free to play game in awhile most free to pay are freemium wear cash can make overly powered but this not the case with warframe there is in store cash only items but most weapons and warframes can be got with simply time and effort combine with combat composed both mele and ranged it makes for a fairly enetetaining mmo

freaking awsome game 1010 will lose my life to this game

look im not typically one to support f2p games but if you enjoyed dark sector this will be right up your alley it is f2p so there are microtransactions which can be on the expensive side but very few noncosmetic items are purchaseonly essentially you can play all of the content of this game without paying a cent minus some color choices and various conveniences like extra weapons or warframe inventories its primarily a pve affair though there is the ability to go to pvp conclaves this game is solid mindless space ninja fun with a lot of variety on weapons and warframes

best f2p game on the market

great time sink multiple levels farming simulator

a lot of people have varrying views on this game there have been bugs in the past which have annoyed some my friends included but i love this game so many hours just spent playing it theyre always updating and adding new stuff whether it be different warframes or weapons and new areas community missions are fun to try and rack up some points the warframes themselves are unique and fun to play around with my favorite being saryn that poison op just about anything you can get by just simply playing the game which cant be said for most free to plays run on walls shoot jump slam and explode your way to victory xd

warframe is a fantastic free to play game about space ninjas with seemingly endless weapons and unique character abilities while some may find the third person combat repetitive the gunplay is satisfying and solid every weapon feels different and provides unique challenges for example the phage fires multiple converging beams of energy which inflict enemies with a debilitating viral infection in contrast to the graceful power of the paris a bow which magnetically accelerates arrows through your enemies there are also an astounding number of melee weapons with equally high variety with a surprisingly deep combo system and several acrobatic maneuvers to keep things interesting perhaps the most interesting parts of the game are the warframes themselves each character has four abilities much like a traditional moba game these abilities range from a grappling hook which can be used to tear enemies in half and navigate the terrain to a power which reanimates the enemies youve killed to fight for you each frame is vaguely themed around an animal or element and fill different roles on a team zephyr a hawklike fighter specializes in mobility and high burst damage while rhino a heavy tank frame excells at soaking up damage and crushing enemies that get in his way the art design in the game is fantastic and provides a unique organic armor feel with distinct enemies and factions this is complemented by the solid sound design which aids in the immersion perhaps my favorite thing about this game is the random encounters as you complete missions you may find yourself at odds with a specific faction youll get a message in your inbox warning you that further actions will have consequences further defiance will result in the appearence of assasins who will track you down and appear in your missions creating a sort of miniboss fight there are frequently community events which feature special rewards and game modes requring players to work together to accomplish a larger goal alerts appear several times a day providing more of a challenge for a specific award often special items that normally require premium currency  while the game is free to play it does not suffer from many of the typical problems of the genre this game is not pay to win while the weapons given to you at the start are clearly inferior to endgame weapons they are still relatively viable literally all noncosmetic content is avaliable without paying a cent daily alerts can sometimes reward players with special rewards which are normally only avaliable through the marketplace boss fights will reward players with otherwise locked weapons etc the only downside is that this results in a good bit of farming although depending on your preference this may not be a bad thing sometimes you may just want to load up an easy mission and slaughter hundreds of soldiers other times you may want more of a challenge and the game provides the means to do this lastly the developers are incredibly open about their work providing one of the most transparent development cycles ive ever seen often taking advice directly from their users into consideration and providing a livestream about the games progress every week patches are released nearly weekly and significant content updates almost monthly adding new missions bosses and reworks which address the concerns of the community i would highly recommend this warframe keep in mind this game is in open beta so there are bound to be problems but being free id say its worth a shot even if this isnt your type of thing

the game is really repetive after playing it for awhile but guessing thats the reason for players to continue to get different weapons in the arsenal
recommended
pretty fun game ill admit its satisfying to get a kill once you get the hang of all the neat tricks you can do the only con about this game are the microtransactions the microtransactions are annoying and limit very much to your gameplay they keep you from getting better and cooler items as a decent game i give it 710 gotta make money somehow right

not a ninja so i cant play this free cost me alot of money and keyboards that i have bashed in rage

back in april 2013 when i first played this game upon initial open beta status this game was absolute garbage environments were almost totally dark textures were crap ai and physics were very subpar no minimap or objective markers and the list went on however its now july and a friend got me to give the game another shot there have been massive improvements and i really think they initially made it open beta too early theyve likely lost a lot of potential players due to bad reviews and bad experiences but give this game a shot as long as you have friends to play with this game will provide hours of group fun even when doing something as mundane as farming materials for crafting items i think warframes devs have made a lot of improvements and more are coming this game is gong to be around a long time additions 62114 so the game has continually been updated things like damage 20 melee 20 new weapons and warframescharacters the game has some issues still and certain changes theyve made recently that i dont care for but and this is a big buthaha this game has something truly unique devs that for the most part listen to their players even if they dont actually make changes or additions suggested they do read them when things have been added to the game the community hates dedigital extremes will jump up to fix them they understand we keep them going they dont take us for granted theyre adding in new enemies and weapons that players have suggested and provided concept art for too theyre even adding in a new player experience in a couple of weeks with update 14 along with an actual pet system as in we get a space dog and have to actually take care of it its not just an extra piece of equipment but a companion all in all while some mistakes get made or bugs happen thosere bound to happen we still are lucky enough to have a developer that actually cares what its players think of their game

i think this game is good
recommended
pure awesomeness this is the most enjoyable game ive played because i always come back to it i think it has to be the most beautiful freetoplay game at the moment and it probably will stll be so for a while
recommended
let me start off by saying this game is addicting it is not only an exemplary example of a third person actionshooter but of a game utilizing a f2p model digital extremes has done a wonderful job ensuring balance across the board whether its between the creditsplatinum or between the weapons and warframes themselves in addition they have written a narrative that is dare i say it relatively fresh and original while simultaneously tying in dark sector for which this game is a spiritual successor to i am genuinely excited to see where warframes story and digital extremes shall take fans of this game next
recommended
great graphics awesome gameplay a very enjoyable game which is easy to play
recommended
this game is very worth a play not pay to win which is a nice change for a free to play
recommended
good game kinda suprised its free

before you play this game ask yourself these questions do i like jumping out of ceiling tiles do i like spending half my day looking for upgrades on pathetic weapons do i enjoy a broken economy where 50 bucks gets me a ratchet  katana if you said yes to any of those grab this gameimmediately

warframe a freetoplay cooperative game that implies the title of freetoplay the story of warframe not too much is known but a basic understanding of it is  its a spiratual sequel to dark sector which pulls some ties in from said game like the technocyte virus etc you are tenno a species of human mutated from the technocyte virus the suit known as a warframe is the suit that gives the user increased power the lotus the one who guides the tenno asks of you to restore the balance to a universe at war that is a very broad understanding of the story there are various bits and pieces of lore in the codex but ill keep the story asset brief the aesthetics of the game are pretty original mostly harkening with the warframes especially everything looks sleek and organic its charming to say the least as for the game itself it is pretty fun while people start out with a minimal amount of equipment which can be considered a subtracting point the player is given fifty starting paidfor currency enough for a mixture of warframe slots and weapon slots these slots allow you to acquire more warframes and weapons throughout your career as a tenno the starter equipment aforementioned which excludes the unique choice of warframe is nothing to write home about  a slowfiring automatic rifle a basic sidearm and sword but those arent your only weapons you can acquire a plethora of weapons can be utilized at the players own discretion things like heavy automatic rifles to whips to lightningchaining weapons the only problem being with the weapons are the samey aspects of them most bulletbased weapons behave like a laserbeam accurate at all distances with little felt recoil as well most of these weapons arent unique very few can be considered unique but that doesnt stop the same aspect as above the warframes themselves are unique each one respects a different element in themselves while it may take a few runs to get the components this will be elaborated further they are a powerful addition to anyone who can utilize them effectively ember can use her flames to scorch the masses frost can utilize his abilities to protect hardpoints or teammates alike things like these help make the game varied with different ways to play with weapons and warframes comes building them you can buy these from the ingame market coming in two flavors  the platinum paid edition or the diy edition buying with paidfor currency not only yields the weaponwarframe in question but it being supercharged more mod points and a free weaponwarframe slot diy is where you need the components and resources to build said item things like alloy plate plastids to a warframe chassis helmet and systems all funnel into the crafting system the crafting system is not stateoftheart as you cannot create multiples of the same item ie i can only build one health restore wait until it is finished building then craft another one but this is where all of the aspects show the freetoplay mantra everything can be acquired in the game trough the usage of ingame currency and time if you want to build a warframe do you have at least a few days you can build himher want that shiny new weapon have twelve hours to a day to spare build it to elaborate further weapons and warframes can be enhanced even further with the use of mods they are just basic alterations that can squeeze out more power out of your weapons basic damage upgrades to elemental damages things like that can help you progress even further simple as that getting an orokin catalyst or reactor will fuel more mod points into your weapons and warframes respectively but that doesnt mean that there are essential mods which make certain mods more useless than others i wont go into detail into that but some mods are unquantifiably essential than others another part of the game is grinding it is part of every game to increase the longevity of the game rng rules all in this department whether it is to get a component or a mod this might be a slight turnoff point for many and is a slight brick wall youll have to do a lot of said act to acquire the best gear it takes a large sum of time to get maximum power to lessen this is trading you can trade mods or paid currency to get those mods you cant get or cheese through the effort of getting one all in all warframe is fun if you can get passed the grinding better with a group of friends as most games are the only problem is the earlygame grinding and some of the waittimes would i recommend it it is free so why not if you get this far then thanks for reading have fun
recommended
great game with high potential just that it must stay free to play

ive seen things you people wouldnt believe attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion i watched cbeams glitter in the dark near the tannhauser gates all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain time to die
recommended
an excellent little gem of an mmo this freetoplay has no point that demands you to enter pvp or cough up for some premium currency though both are an option this is only further complimented by the mix of platformer and thirdperson shooter thats balanced just right the only reasons you could hate this game would be if you couldnt stand the lore or simply dont like the games composition there are sections that cater to every level of skill and force nobody to stay within or go beyond them get into warframe but bring friends if you want a crew to work with you for more than one or two missions
recommended
u basically play as a space ezio
recommended
takes a while to get the hang of it but is very fun
recommended
if this game was a bowl of ramen then it would be a very good bowl of ramen

its good but the community is mostly idiots its impossible to coop stealth because everyone else just charges in blasting everything and gettting you detected
recommended
amazing game to play with your friends very awesome and it takes true skill to be good
recommended
its a bit hard to get the grasp of the foundry and modding system at first but its well worth the task once you figure that out its smooth sailing from there it has a good survivability and technically doesnt require you to spend one cent even though its easier

ah yes warframe the game that did beat my favorite game in that one mmobomb tournament so it is only natural that i try the game to see how it works for the record what happened with that mmobomb tourney is all said and done and what was said will be the last time i mention it in this review looking at it for the first time the game doesnt really stand out its a third person shooter set in space and while space games are a viable genre its a known genre you take control of a warframe out to defeat a faction hell bent on taking complete control of the solar system or a massive weapons manufacturing company wanting to exploit secrets of a past life being one of which is your frame or tasked with wiping out an infestation of mutated beings from the first two factions sounds pretty run of the mill but it works graphics are solid the frames themselves seem realistic or as realistic as they could be for a scifi shooter and one can definitely sense the textures used on their suits the environments are nice looking as well ranging from industrial grit to hightech polish to overgrown biomass strewn all over the maps i cant say that i was too immersed in the game but with a game like this immersion is almost impossible so what the game does it does well i do feel that a few of the newer frames do seem out of place  theyre over designed and have too much going on with them leading to messy textures to gaudy coloring  but for the most part everything feels solid the weapons are nicely modeled and textured as well weapons that are from a particular faction look the part though some do stick out a bit namely the infested type weapons which dont seem to fit in the game as well as the others sounds are good as well though i do feel that the enemies  namely the corpus  do get annoying with their gibberish turning the sound off is easy enough however the ui is also good in this game its clean easy to read and unobtruisve which is what every ui should be i have seen screenshots of the game in its infancy and i am glad they changed the ui to what it is now which makes the game look a lot more professional looking than before the gameplay is where the game does shine though as stated this is a third person shooter so the game isnt too groundbreaking however what it does it does well everything seems to fit seamlessly together with intuitive for the most part controls and fluid motions using melee is a bit awkward at first to use it quickly one presses e and one has to bind a key to switch to melee altogether but in the end it makes sense as e is readily accessible there are a few more problems though wallrunning is a bit akward especially if one is trying to run up into a vent it does not always work and often leaves me annoyed another is switching weapons which is done using the f key rather than the middle mouse wheel like other shooters but i am assuming that can be rebound crafting is straightforward enough in order to make something you need a blueprint and materials blueprints are often bought from the marketplace the rest farmed from missions are bought from your clan dojo for in game currency while the player farms for the materials simple enough and once that is all done you hit build and wait about 12 hours i do find that the time is a bit silly 12 hours for a gun on top of that there are few weapons available that can be bought with credits which is the in game currency the majority of them are bought with platinum which is the cash shop currency though platinum can be traded between players it feels cash grabby and arbitrary to have those timers as one can rush build them for platinum now for the drawbacks of this game one is the mastery system which requires players wait a full 24 hours before each attempt especially the first test where new players are screwed because of the starting gun this could be solved in many ways  one attempt the test as many times as you want if you fail this is a video game why should you have to wait two give new players a better gun or three make the test somewhat easier i know many are thinking that i suck because of the gun being used but for the record i have switched to a better gun and as expected i passed normally i would say that it depends on player skill for these tests but with the damage system in the game its the gun that makes the difference moreso than the player in short remove the 24 hour restriction it is pointless and all it does is add frustration or if de wants to keep it give new players a better gun or make the test easier the next drawback is the elevators in the game they seem simple enough call for the elevator get in wait for your team and trigger it except almost every team i ran with forgot the third part wait for the team i know that this is more to do with the players but de could put in a way for everyone to tag the elevator before it can be triggered otherwise  and this is what happens usually  you have one person who shows up too late and misses the elevator if its a short ride this is no problem but in some cases waiting can be a real pain and all it does is thin out the party de has a checkpoint system with the dual locked doors but something in the elevators that forces everybody in the party to tag it before triggering would work wonders third and probably the biggest drawback of the game is the fact it runs out of steam very quickly what i mean by this is simple one can reach the end of the game pretty quickly even with lower levelled items this could be for many reasons the build timers could be one or the fact that certain materials that are required for some weapons are far off and by the time you get the materials you either have a better weapon than the one you want to build or that you have your weapon modded enough that the one you want to build is actually worse it feels awkward and makes me want to play the game less why would i want to repeat the process with a frame or weapon that is worse than the one i have maybe its just me but i feel the game just runs out of steam in all warframe is a great game its not anything groundbreaking but what it does it does well and makes for a fun hackandslash game that can keep you entertained i do hope that it is expaned on in the future though and not just with events but things that acutally expand the gameplay aside from that its definitely a game to check out
recommended
great game all i can say
recommended
story game has lore but not much of a story line the devs do put a nice touch on lore with the ever frequent events gameplay movement is my favorite part of the gameplay from wall running to dodgerolling out of enemy fire with a creative mind you can get almost anywhere gunplay and melee is also great the massive amount of weapons in the game allow for you to have any type of build run and gun pick up an assault rifle like to pick people off from a distance plenty of longrange weapons feel like going rambo and shooting exploding arrows go ahead warframe has enough weapons to satisfy hundreds of hours of bloodlust f2p vs p2w probably the best reason why you should give this game a try the devs are extremely careful with how the microtransaction system works on the game every weapon warframe and sentinel are easily craftable viaingame or you can help the devs out a bit by purchasing them in the market the only thing that isnt available via crafting are some cosmetics and expcredit boosters overall warframe is a great f2p game that has a vast deversity of niches you can get yourself into the community is great although a bit quirky at times the developers also take great care in working and communicating with the community in order to make improvements on the game
recommended
great for quick coop action good balance of a third person shooter mixed with rpg elements a number of glitches can be identified but seriously its f2p so no complaints and its still in beta 7510

this game if i remember correctly i found warframe right before easter 2013 everybody i knew was getting bored of me3 multi or still playing skyrim i found warframe one night tooling around on steam looking for something to replace them and what a replacement i found warframe gave me the pve and the grindycollection i was looking for its missions can be so fast paced that you will loose track of time and if you are like me make other games seem like they are lacking digital extremes updates and patches this game so often that it is almost a completely different gameplay since i started playing way back in april im not going to sit here and tell you its perfect everything has cons every once in a while hotfixes or patches will break something in the game and we the players have to report it to de for them to fix it usually they are pretty good at clearing these things out but hey its technically a beta to keep blabbering on about what a good game it is would be repititious so ill leave you with this if you like pve 4person coop extreme character agility ability powers and all with somewhat grindy crafting system that you can make a multitude of unique weapons with interchangeable mods you will like this game
recommended
warframe has undergone a ton of changes since i played it in august of 2013 almost all for the better the gameplay is surprisingly fun and addictive its a fluid 3rd person combat where you can transition seamlessly between ranged and melee combat theres multiple frames with unique powers and builds plenty of weapons a handful of environmentstilesets and a neat trading card type system to level up mods for your weapons between ps4 and pc ive probably put around 100 hours into this game and digital extremes is doing a good job of adding things that make you come back for more theres always something to unlock something to level up and plenty of shortduration events for awesome rewards and specials the game isnt without its flaws however there are some f2p shenanigans im not wild about if you want a new rifle you may have to buy blueprints with ingame currency farm materials of varying rarities and then wait a day or two while it bakes theres plenty of room for shortcuts though you can use platinum realmoney currency to buy the gun outright or speed up the build time in the 100 hours i played i didnt pay a single dime which says a lot for how much content is accessible without being overbearing since its coop and many things are gated by a proficiency level which is based on how many items youve leveled up theres no real sense of p2w there are some technical issues with the game some of the environments start to repeat a lot there are only a handful of tilesets and 3 factions of bad guys movement is sometimes clunky and unresponsive which isnt normally a problem but some of the finessebased platforming means you feel more like a dumptruck and less like a ninja all told having put 100 hours into this game and not having paid a dime for it i can say its worth playingyouve got nothing to lose

i think warframe is fun and most peeople would enjoy
recommended
warframe is like ze best 3rd person shooter i have ever played tried it d

i personally like this game a lot but i feel like not enough people play it its a very creative and beautiful game that sets itself apart from from other games with its levels but after a while it gets slightlyh repetetive in my opinion i give this game 8510

dis gam is so gud that i soiled myself upwards of tree tims

its a bit like pve third person quake with mmoelements you run through linear level and guncut down lots of enemies enemies drop ressources credits and modifications with which you can upgrade your warframe class and your weapons ressources and credits can be used to build new warframes or weapons weapons and warframes level up which allows them to use more modifications you can build new warframes and weapons with ressources and credits both found in missions quake because the gameplay is pretty fast warframes are very mobile including options for running up walls and sliding the controls are well done one of the few shooters where i didnt change the settings by much the f2pmechanic is really f2p while you can buy pretty much everything with real money in the game the game doesnt force you to do so the gameplay is always nice and the farming isnt very time consuming until very late in the game the only thing i would critizise are the few slots for warframes and weapons but its possible to somewhat negate that with the starting platinum platinum is the real money ressource and you start with a 100 of it so you can spend that to get more slots the gameplay is somewhat repetitive though there are about 10 enemy types per faction with 3 factions and 6 mission types 4 of the missions play out very similarily and the other 2 are pretty much the same it also doesnt really matter if you play an exterminate mission against grineer on one planet or another aside from the enemylevel the developer has added 2 recently more which play a bit more uniquely the weapons and warframes somewhat offset that because they play out differently the endgame is pretty bad from what i can see though some weapons and warframes are really overpowered one faction is heavily underpowered so once you get your angstrom or ogris and max it out there is no real reason to play the game anymore especially since the game is a bit to easy if you play it with 3 friends anyways the graphics are pretty good for a f2p game it isnt really performant though and quite odd in that regard it runs more fluid on a computer of a friend of mine even though my computer is stronger for example so overall nice gameplay with lots of options you can melee shoot sneak somewhat and are pretty fast fun fair f2p model big amount of content good at not frustrating people mods are reuseable discarded weapons give you a bit of money back no f2p tyranny repetitive bad endgame bad balancing bad difficulty scaling with more players i give it a 910 for a f2p game i would give it a 65 if i paid for it try it out if you have time to kill and dont hate science fiction or third person shooter

i was a little skeptical abou tthis game because i heard it was still in beta but after i played for 20 hours on a friends computer i am now hooked with the great graphics and controls the game just feels really fluid theres little to no glitches and all around just a great game try it out for yourself and see
recommended
i was a bit cautious about playing this game because i was afraid it would be paytowin but is actually possible to get everything in the game through standard gameplay weapon mods parts and blueprints can be sold to other players in exchange for platinum the premium currency the game is very fun to play and there are guns and warframes essentially characters to accomodate just about any playstyle whether you enjoy sniping from afar while cloaking yourself and sneaking around running around shooting lightning from your ing hands using magnetism to crush your enemies into oblivion running in guns blazing and raising hell getting up close and personal with your enemies and ripping them to pieces with one of the many many melee weapons weapons warframes and sentinels can be built leveled up and modded with special abilities and perks with a surprising amount of customizability all in all this game is very very fun and i would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing thirdperson shooters with online coop the community seems generally nice and willing to help out new players from what ive experienced
recommended
seriously the only f2p title that ever kept my attention first i thought ugh another pay to win title and worse being kind of a mass effect ripoff then hey whatever it is its fun it is tremendous fun i like the fact that it is only pve and pvp doesnt factor in at all most of the community is nice and fun even if there are some dis around so even playing with random people is fun playing with friends is the best

set in the far reaches of outer space during a new dark age warframe introduces the tenno a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the grineer for centuries players enter warframe on the cusp of the grineers victory over the tenno until they begin to arm themselves with warframes  an ancient exoskeletal technology only they can operate hidden within the orokin derelicts of a lost civilization new warframes lie dormant and undiscovered these artifacts are the tennos only hope for survival with the lack of a pay to win system and easy engagement for new players warframe offers some quality time as a freetoplay game warframe is a nice surprise that sets the base for a promising future warframe isnt anything special its not revolutionary exceptional or timeless still  every time i returned to the game it kept playing for at least an hour without regret digital extremes has made an enjoyable engrossing spectacular game especially when you find yourself a team or  even better  invite some friends if you need a new opportunity to slaughter aliens you should try warframe

warframe is a great game to play with friends since it is very much a coop game and teamwork is essential for success on top of everyting its free also this is not a pay to win game since all ingame items can be crafted or won in ingame events without spenidng a dime the graphics are great and sometimes i just play because of them though there is no actual story there are planets items guns clans and anything needed to make this a great scifi game thatll give you hourse of fun just beware if your computer is very slow lag may affect gameplay
recommended
ive been playing warframe for a year and a half now and i can say it is the best mmofpsrpg game ever the graphics are amazing the customizability is exstensive and the gameplay itself is addicting this game is not for everyone particularly in the sense that its not a normal mmo
recommended
its very hard to believe this is a free to play game it takes many machanics from other games i enjoy and uses them in a way that makes you want to keep playing you will lose hours
recommended
a really cool game for heavy machines and even normal ones
recommended
this game is pretty great if you like space ninjas and eviscerating things this game is the one for you

this is a very fun and adicting game with a fast pace and shooter aspect fun for all types of gamers

this is on of the most amazing games ive ever played on steam and i know why everyone is talking about it  the amazing space ninjas and great weapons plus that sweet parkour is the best mix 3
recommended
i downright love this game its chaotic fast action with space ninjas play however you want with a wide variety of weapons and abilities which you can then further customise with mods addons to your weaponry and warframes that add effects such as increased stamina or fire damage honestly one of the best freetoplay games on steam and its still in beta however i do recommend a decent computer
recommended
youre a space ninja with an obsession for grinding you grind for more space ninjas and space ninja weapons so you can grind for better grinding weapons the end game consists of trying to grind the hardest and surviving literal hours against waves of increasingly more difficult versions of enemies youve fought before possibly over thousands of times before ive lost control of my life10
recommended
great game with a unique aesthetic frequent content updates and fun combat unfortunately the lack of an overall story or objective tends to make it feel like an endless grinding simulator if you can look past that warframe will provide hours upon hours of free entertainment its a good game to kill time and have stupid fun
recommended
ninjas with guns in space doing parkour plus magic just play it its free you have no excuse
recommended
warframe though it may be slow at first is an outstanding free to play game with a  amount of content and completely new classes and weapons and cosmetic items earned completely free it is also an excellent deal i have spent no money at all and about 60 hours in have constructed dozens of weapons hundreds of mods and killed thousands of enemies give it a try and add me if you need some help 85100

a very pretty scifi shooter with impressive ninjastyle gameplay levels are randomly generated so if you replay a mission its different every time this can get a bit repetitive when the same room or corridor is used 4 times in the same level though but hey its space efficiency in ship design is crucial p unfortunently there are no free female warframes by default you have to pay for one or basically complete half the game to craft them normally i wouldnt complain about this but warframe promotes heavy character development and customization ergo its difficult for me to get in touch and immersived in such a game while playing a male character other than that its a really nice game oh and free to play of cause

this game has two things i normally dislike free to play and a strong multiplayer focus on top of that it has next to nothing going on in terms of story or characters however it is a ton of fun to play gradually improving your equipment and facing larger odds and threats is very satisfying and its easy to find a build that feels unique to you or be a boring person and follow a guide i guess it takes a while to get going there are some rough edges its a beta after all but the combat is very rewarding and generally fair and the monetization mechanics are generally not that annoying

think of castlevania hd on the xbox its the type of game that you would not enjoy if you are playing it solo however add a couple of friends in the mix and you got yourself a rootin tootin time the game lacks a true story mode or a single player experiance but makes up for it in the sheer amount of content various types of mission have you and your friends going through shooting baddies and collecting material to build your next mass murdering machine the game even has boss battles that put your warframes and gear to the limit although the game free to play f2p most content can be obtained with a little effort on your part you can even go as far as selling that hard to find mod modification cards to increase the stats of warframes or weapons or insanely difficult blueprint used to craft new material and obtain money from a willing buyer in the community that can be used to obtain weapon slots to add more weapons to your arsenal or buy some cosmetic items to make your warframe a fashionable kililng machine theres nothing to lose when playing this game so it wont hurt to give it a try like said before this game would be geared towards someone who is looking for that new multiplayer experiance with friends

i have put near 500 hours in to this if that says any thing about it a masterful game with strong game play and with a high skill cap plenty of gear and levels to play war frame is best played with buddys and id recommend dropping five or ten bucks on it and forgetting the free to play you can earn any thing in the game by playing events offer any thing from new guns to cosmetic items but buy plat will make getting started a lot more easy the only draw back to warframe is the truly insane crafting times to build new frames a and clan gear but that is vastly out matched by its meany other achievements at its base warframe was made by people and scott who love ninjas and space and robots and zombies and pirates and made the perfect combination hack and slash and shot and space magic with rougelike elements and rpg to bring you warframe a game about having fun

this game has come such a long way since release now i cant stop playing it everything in the game can be unlocked as long as you put some time into it so even if there are a lot of purchasable items and equipment you can still be on par with those players the combat is extremely fluid physics are wonderful graphics are fuing amazing and the diversity in the frames and weapon builds make it fun to show off to your friends

this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

ive been playing warframe for a while and i have to say that it is a pretty good game any bugs that are found ingame are almost instantly fixed by the next day in their very frequent bug fixes and updates i feel that this shows a dedication to the consumers to provide a very enjoyable gaming experience i feel that the gameplay is very invigorating and engaging keeping you on your toes most of the time its a multiplayer game even though you do have the option of playing solo you have a wide variety of customizations for your warframes cosmetically and stat wise overall i think that this game is great and that anyone who reads this should give it a try its free to play even though you can pay real money to make microtrasnactions ingame for special items i give warframe a 910
recommended
really fun and enjoyable you have to have patience while playing though building anything can take quite a few hours

ive played this game so much that when i try playing a different game i just find myself playing more warframe

warframe where space ninjas do battle to ensure their very survival and uphold balance in the universe this game put simply has been an interesting and amazing experience there are people willing to help there are constant updates to keep you interested and has an immersing ui system the endless possiblities of modding your weapons or frames the amazing color packs if you decided to get extras and the actual visual gameplay i am proud to say that de has made me hooked on this game good job and congradulations to any awards you guys may win i look forward to playong more of your creations

warframe is a pve focused cooperative scifi action shooter game where you get to play as one of this spec ops people with exosuits who are infected with technocyte virus that gives them supernatural powers its meant to be based on the dark sector universe but in a distant dystopian future theres about 5 female and 5 male warframes currently with their own unique abilities and appearance and still more coming you can go around collect cards which work as weapon or warframe upgrades from the missions you play level up your warframe to be able to equip more of those upgrades and fuse the mods together to make these upgrades even more powerful nearly anything can be obtained through ingame progression and be crafted after a bit of grinding and farming so you dont necessarily need to spend any real money to get the good stuff there are several yet similar game modes and environments most of them fun and replayable but still has room for more improvements all that being said the game has near to no customisation aside from alternate helmets and colour palettes theres no genderswap option which is a huge downside for me personally and the upcoming pvp feature {much much later} which i dont care for in the slightest this game is definitely worth a try if youve got friends to play with pugs arent an option as everyone seems to be either speedrunning or trying to be a  going solo is always an option though if you want challenge updated august 2013 the company behind the game seem to want to turn the whole game into a tedious repetitive grindfest cashcow where youll just get stressed or bored enough and resort to buying what you need from their store rather than a replayable funfest its their first mmo and theyre learning thats all fine but im afraid theyre learning from the wrong people stay away unless you dont mind the grind otherwise still a regularly updated fun game

get this  now its ing awesome

one really enjoyable game especially with friends also you can play it for free without needing to buy anything also space ninjas are cool

if you got the time and effort this game is fun and easy paying makes the game boring and short lasting appeal i mean yeah colors are cool to buy but the items that you can buy for free not cool bro i find it funny this games a beta and if you have friends or strangers and the good guns you can have some extreme fun or just hangout in your clan dojo or shoot a random army down and i played this game 2 months after beta release so i know what im doing this game is phenonmal i cant imagine whats in the full version lost out

recommended for third person view style lover nothing more to say to this awesomeness wish i played this 1 year earlier 
recommended
this game is one of the first games i got when i got steam i love this game this is an amazing game its almost hard to believe its free love it
recommended
pros  good customisation  good combat  sound quality is excellent cons  no clear story your just thrown into the battle with no real reason to kill the enemies apart from your told to and that theyre shooting at you  repetetive environments jungle factory maybe if your lucky a bright factory  odd weapon unlock system overall i would reccomend this game for the combat and customisation alone however if you look for fun and story telling in a game then this isnt the game for you the gore may give you some giggles for the first few times you make an enemies torso fly into space team rocket style but once youve seen one decapateted enemy sliced and diced like mince meat youve seen them all
recommended
all those of you who like hardcore coop shooters like warframe will be delighted with its content although its reliability of you spending real world money on a free game is kind of unfair
recommended
warframe is great its lore is fantastic the setting and artistic designs are excellent and its gameplay and replayability are quite recommended i easily found myself wanting to know more about the tenno the lotus the other factions the infestation viruses and mysteries within the solar system orokin and the void anyone but the game explains very little outside the minisolo vors campaign this game could have easily been my game of the year if it wasnt for so many issues regarding its game design the most infuriating one being > its clearly a not player friendly game  youre early forced to choose a single warframe and weapon composition at the very beginning of the game and commit to it whether you like it or not  the vor campaign feels like a mini tutorial its a fantastic way to explain the game mechanics and part of its lore yet once its finished the game feels kinda empty plot wise and very little is explained failing a mission will result into a totaltimewaste inc  playing stealthy is pointless i found myself going sneaky bow bo and kunai fighting when to my surprise the matchmaking kept throwing players at my game gunblasting and speeding throughout levels therefore ruining the solo experience i had enjoyed so far  soloing survival  capture  defense missions is a titanic task matchmaking is then mandatory and it may result into godlike 1000 grinded hours players or hi i just killed vor and i barely know how to warframe bro players so good luck grinding for crafting materials throughout the solar system in a wide variety of missions is fun grinding a concrete annoying boss im talking about at you alad v and your pesky zanuka for a rare material that may or may not drop in order to craft an important part of the game such as warframes helmets is not 80% of the mods you find are just salvage  vendor meat map repetitiveness predictable ai from the enemies and very little purpose on doing some missions makes you lose eagerness to login daily quite easily learning curve is quite blur and once you master the sprint  slide  melee attack drill thats pretty much it aside from warframes powers dont get me wrong most of what ive played from it is incredible for a f2play game combat is fluid build options are quite wide 2handed shotguns spamming lightning warframes stealth tankymelee etc and coop features clans and the like will have you willing for more still the game grabs you in hooks you up for a while and tries to milk the platinum out of you at some points youll feel like playing dark souls 3000 some missions are plain t to go through alone or no money invested again having to wait 3 days for your new hardearned warframe to come out of the foundry or not being able to customize it with the colour you like cosmetics aside is not cool yo i wouldve definitely paid 40 bucks for a solid well put together single player campaign and a patchable online mode with 100% of the content reachable by crafting but since the game offers the chance of not paying i will continue to login every now and then and grind with no purpose at all since the real cool stuff like orokin reactors formas and its like are something out of the plebs reach at this point and considering all of the above im quite certain to say that free 2 play model has screwed warframe up see you next patch tenno

its really worth it to play this

recommended
great game requires quite a bit dedication for farming materials and pieces but the action and playability is great
recommended
warframe may be just another online game but a fairly decent one that can last a while for those who can stomach some of the grinding it is being constantly updated because it still isnt really out of beta after all of this time it is just too buggy to be considered a full release the guns and melee system are keen and work fairly well but the ai arent that great the game needs work done but can be fun if you are willing to overlook a few glaring problems
recommended
once you get this game youll be playing it nonstop
recommended
this is one of those rare games that isnt addictive because youre grinding for the best gear or hunting achievements or any of the other conventional gameplay gimmicks its addictive because simply playing the game is so damn fun the gunplay and swordplay mixed with fluid parkourstyle movement around the maps makes the action in this game very dynamic youll want to log in and bash baddies not because you need materials to make that new gun although thats also a worthy goal youll want to log in because playing the game is like living out your own personal scifi action movie with ninjas in space space ninjas almost forgot to put that part in here
recommended
great game and free content every month  long time fun guarantees  no pay2win

amazing guns blazing or stealth shooter for anyone who likes space and or ninjas d

overall game is good  but it lack in tutorial of the game and helps section
recommended
the game is great  one of the best free to play games ive ever played  only played 123 hours so far the amount of grinding that needs to be done and missions to complete of different difficulties makes it so that the player can never say ive done everything without properly playing the game for hours upons hours a good selection of warframes different characters basically to make and use missions like survival make it fun to play with friends for a long period of time and with so much bosses and items to collect one can not be bored ill give this a 810 due to the fact that i havent tried the pvp nor have i ventured deep enough in the game ie the highiest missions to give a full review ill mostly give this a 9 after venturing further and maybe a 10 once i get in to the pvp and so fourth also there are many glitches and beta issues that pop up from time to time for example people getting disconnected as soon as a game starts  people getting kicked from the party at extraction and so fourth but overall for a beta  this game is pretty awesome so 810 for now and it can only get better in my opinion try it out

i spend most of my time hitting random storage containers with a sword good way to waste time 1010
recommended
cybernetic ninjasevents and constant updatesthe developers are keeping this alive and i am pretty damn happy about how far they have come with all the content that has been added to the game itself
recommended
this game is just awesome you can choose from just a few weapons when you start but then you have the chance to craft your own weapons and there are like alot the graphics are awesome too about how it looks and how efficient they are you can easily get 40 fps with a fairly old computer the detail i personally like is that its not p2w atleast not completely if you get kia you can spend a revive wich is bought from the market or you can be revived by a teammate in coop the only things i dont like about it are the unstability of the game servers and just a few bugs in the connection system and in the steam launcher
recommended
one of the bestif not the bestf2p games ive played to get this out of the way this game is not pay 2 win in fact the best gear is only obtained through playing cannot be bought warframe strongly encourages working in a team though that doesnt mean that you cant go solo theres a whole option dedicated to that and with a large list of weapons and warframes to choose from therell always be something to do the only bad thing i could say is that if youre looking for a story or indepth game this is definitely not for you the missions will get tedious for those that dont like killing things over and over again still it is a very well developed game that delivers several hours of ninja fun
recommended
this game is great plus its free the game is fast paced and hard
recommended
its a game you dont always have to play to advance in but it has to build stuff like clash of clans if you do play warframe which you should join my clan
recommended
good game  but craft is bad
recommended
awesome game huge selections of warframes to choose from each with unique playstyle and skills hundreds of mods to customize your build and weapons everything other than weapon and frame slots can be obtained by playing well a lot of time or get it with real money

ok pros fast paced shooting mechanics decent sword mechanics good mobility customization not that good but workable teamwork can still play solo however and a stealth and freerun mechanic nvidia graphics and physics cons you will never get into pvp becuase of your inventory  doesnt meet the requirements unfair if not almost cheating ai cash store always dangled in front of your face when the game adds a new playable warframe it feels like you must pay in order to play it feels unrewarding buggy beyond beleif but thats because its an mmo near impossible to join a guildclan notorius time waster lotus voice overall i enjoyed this game for a few days but between drm lack of commmunication with other players and cash store ads i reached my pain enjoyment thresh hold it just seems like a time waster and you never feel like you accomplish anything unless you sink in $$$ of course if you need to waste a few hours go ahead but it just felt to as if there was no point to doing all of the same repeating missions over and over again its up to you
recommended
this game is filled with ups and down but over all the gme is very good in all the aspects of the fight and firefights i verymuch enjoy this game and will being playing this game until my eyes bleed but i dont think i will let it get to that point althought i cant make any promises so if your thinking about playingdownloading this game do it is seriously awesome and i recommend it to everyone i know
recommended
i would recommend this game to people who are used to the diablo style of grinding as well as have a group of friends to play along with this game can get very tiresome fast unless you form a clan or join one and do missions with your clan mates pvp is also not were it should be it has a lot of balancing to do but has a ton of potential
recommended
damned fun game takes some time to get into but its great for a f2p

this is such a good game

oh my god the best thing ever

where do i start with this game to hold your attention warframe is a fast phased action packed thrill ride with marvelous graphics in an ever expanding universe with its own level up system upgrades parkour magic spaceninjas you name it and the devs who brought this game are very talented people who do their best to daily bring new things to the table however this game does lack a proper endgame as of yet and suffers from repetition but its the constant content which will keep you coming back for more it really is a great experience with lots of potential for years to come

i havent played this a lot but for the time i have played i enjoyed it i wanted different tenno though but thats really grindy and really hard to get if you dont have a good group with you the controles may seem wonky but if you change them to your liking then theyre amazing the only thing bad i can really say is the melee its weak and everywhere but if you know how to make your tenno its strong and everywhere and sometimes the only freaking thing you use the maps are practically all the same but different routes the weapons are the same just different stats just like dust 514 and its easy to get out of control thinking youre a badass and getting yourself mauled overall its a pretty good game not something id play all day every day but still good enough to catch my attention especially considering i dont like super fast paced anything or thirdperson games oh also the lighting the lighting is too extravegant so if the flare bothers you turn off lighting effects it helps speed up the game and its better on the eyes and makes it feel more natural

u can do wall run like in prince of persia i think i dont need to tell u anything else
recommended
great game to play i have already put hours into it and it gets better with every update
recommended
its a great multi player free game with a choice of weapons quests pets and money i love the game because its fun to play with your mates and i recommend it
recommended
this game is cool like a coop hack and slash scifi game  tps shooter awesome
recommended
i feel like this is a game im gonna be playing for a while pros  ninja space swords shotguns  coop elements  awesome introduction  multiple guns and a awesome arsenal  also some rpg elements added cons  kinda lags on lowest settings  i prefer first person  some p2w elements but at least they dont scream money at you i recommend this game for the awesome shooting n stuff and cool storyline
recommended
ive been waiting for this and its here finally
recommended
it absolutely ruined my life 10
recommended
this is one of the best third person shooter i have ever played wwith good graphics and a nice soundtrack with energetic and fast pace gameplay makes the game very enjoyable and also the choice of stealth or aggressive gameplay and also the choice of support roles if you dont like to lead in games the main problem with the game is that it is a freemium so you can play it for free and be just as good as premium players it just takes a lot more effort and grinding to obtain the really good items but for me personally i dont mind but i can tell some people dont like stuff like that
recommended
complicated but once you get into it and understand how to play it is one of the most fun games i have ever played 1010 would recommend
recommended
im enjoying warframe immensely the cooperative atmosphere among the players is refreshing and the gameplay is varied and fun your loadout will become tuned to your playstyle in so many ways its astounding i have a good friend showing me the ropes and helping me get some of the items but its just as playable with random strangers youll quickly learn some things and slowly learn others a few bugs speckle every play session but not enough to frustrate me out of playing highly recommended
recommended
im hooked warframe is so well done one of the best 3rd person action free to play game i have ever played keep up the good work digital extreme
recommended
its quite fun but mostly the clears throat you know what i mean right if you are one who likes to grind things with friends and  them off like me then this game is for you if you enjoy the excitement of crafting things then this game is for you that is why i myself renamed this game something inappropriate c
recommended
great game love it a ton free to play just makes it all the better controls are easy to adapt to and the freerunningparkour aspect is amazing but slightly buggy 9510 would play
recommended
best free to play i have ever played no need to spend money at all major plus the game acts and looks as if its worth at least $50 highely recommend
recommended
really well thought out game not your standard fps mmo this is like a hybrid of a mmorpg an online first person shooter and a collectable card game really fun to play once you get used to what is going on biggest downside is that the mapsenemies get a little repetitive a solid 810

recommended
still better than cod
recommended
as i near my near my 200th hour in warframe i still consider this one of the best games i have sunken my time into mmos are sort of my thing i have played hundereds of hours in many diffrent games and warframe is by far the best i have played part of what makes it even more increadible is that they are still olny in beta i have been around since alpha roughly patch 90 and i have been impressed with every minute i love the feel of the game the weapon system the seemless incooperation of melee weapons and especially the movement system i alos appreciate that as a free to play they have a live pay market but that they have managed to make it possible to earn or craft nearlly anything in the game making it not pay to win as it stands i consider this one of the best scifi games on the market one of the best mmos and by far the best f2p mmo it is especially great if you enjoy small group multiplayer friend olny squads and resource based crafting while it currently lakes in story hopefully to be fixed soon it makes up for it in shear quality of game mechanics i rate this roughly an 875 to 95
recommended
plays like most fps with smooth graphics and more coop missions few real soloonly mission so ban open upmost any map to let others spawn into you game and work as assault teams custom mods allow for a lot of variety from weapon upgrades to cosmetics like many other games this can quickly go paytowin however it is not required if you want to go slower and enjoy the experience as freeto play very pretty and fast graphics

awesome action game to play with friends d
recommended
this game has changed alot for the better from when i last played it it is now in my top 5 favorite games instead of my top 5 worst games 1210 dolphins
recommended
what more is there to do than recommend this game first of all its free to play this means you dont have to pay money to play it it does not mean it will run like those flashgames that represented what was free to play just 5 years ago although free to play used in the manner as it is used in warframe it means you can play without paying but paying could make the experience better nonetheless as a nonpaying user i think for myself that it plays just fine for free warframes looks are equal to or better than most aaa releases and the gameplay is likewise it might take more than a few hours of playing it to understand how to work it properly and it doesnt always tell you excactly how to pull off every move but this also leaves a lot of room for experimentation which i think is one of the points where this game shines rather brightly if you like ninjas scifi shooters stealth actions or slashers warframe is likely to hit you in at least one good spot
recommended
great game timeeater but giving satisfaction from completing a quest or crafting a new frame
recommended
feels like a fullgame every time i play i forget its freetoplay
recommended
this game is pretty fun i did not enjoy it that much but if you have a gaming computer on high graphics you will not bee dissapoint

really fun and a good way to be introduced to an mmo
recommended
it was fun
recommended
warframe mah gawd
recommended
best raiden simulator ive played yet
recommended
glory to warframe when i first started the game offered a challenging scaling game with all the updates after it the story progresses and the game gets better de tries hard as a developer to listen to its fan base not so much on here but on their own forums fast paced gameplay ninjas and a great sci fi setting are the hallmarks of this game i still have not yet cleared every map point and the alert missions keep me on my toes as i see chances for good loot and the battles between the corpus and grineer id recommend this game to anyone who has an open mind and maybe a buddy or two willing to give it a shot with u14 a great tutorial launched making the learning curve less of a pain good luck if you take the game up if not best of luck where you end up
recommended
well uh this game has good graphics thats about it \
recommended
this is what happens when you marry the excitement of the mass effect trilogy to the gears of war franchise you would have warframe if you enjoy both those games the visuals of mass effect and all its scifi goodies and just want hords of baddies coming at you get this game
recommended
i really love warframe butthey need to add more wild on earth hope that happends

i went into warframe thinking itd just be another orion dino horde after about 6 hours of nonstop gameplay a lack of a need to purchase ingame items with real money jumping into bulletfest after bulletfest and an utter addiction to being a proper freakin gunandswordweilding space ninja i said otherwise

recommended
so i played warframe a lot during the beta maybe a little to much to where i out did my self on the game and then it just got boring it started to get boring though when shotguns came into play and anyone who had one could whipe the floor of any mission later on i come back and see they changed everything while some is nice i hate most all of the changes made not to mention the gameplay is still boring however all co op style games are boring and are even more so if one person is able to do all of the work for you kinda like boarderlands 2 its dull as hell i havent yet beat it because after the first 30 mins its just straight up boring to me warframe is fun playing it alone though as a single player or sometimes with one other person if they do not have something overpowered i got this one guy in my clan into the gamehe is addicted he has over 3k almost 4k hours into it
recommended

this is a grindy f2p game so if you dont like to grind then you should turn back you can buy the weapons and warframes you want right from the start excluding the primes if youre willing to dish out the cash or you can buy them with the platinum you can get by trading items ingame i worked my way up to rank 14 by grinding and the feeling of accomplishment is worth it anyways the game might get boring once you get to rank 8 and above cause they dont really have many weapons that are unlocked with high ranks so basically when you reach rank 6 youll be able to get the endgame stuff the game is constantly updating with hotfixes or new content every week to keep the game from feeling too boring i would like it if they added newer game modes which they have done a couple of times before so it is expected that they will bring more later on the community is bustling and you can make clans and alliances i like being able to edit your own dojo but once again that gets boring after a while and also takes a lot of forma this resource in game that can only be grinded after you grind for keys and its not like you get forma a lot anyways besides the tedious grinding it adds to the experience unless youre really far into the game otherwise it might feel more like a hinderance loyalty to the game is also rewarded for logging in every day and you get stuff like weapons you can only unlock from the daily rewards and also discounts on platinum loyalty is also rewarded if you check the updates or site often cause they usually put up these events with exclusive rewards that you can only get by doing the missions newer players may have missed many vandal weapons but there are other weapons that are better than them ingame so youre not missing out much the only things that you may be missing out on are the exclusive mods from the events where they could go for 100 platinum in a trade if you want to get stuff like this just be sure to check the site occasionally i highly recommend the game its fun the community is pretty good but once in a while you may run into a troll or showoff so yeah anyways i hope this review was helpful
recommended
a seriously fun game if you have the patience to repeatedly do missions to gather materials for better weapons

maybe this is what are you searching for  warframe is freetoplay cooperative third person shooter video game  and you should give it a try because it worth
recommended
warframe is a great scifi thirdperson shooter the shooting feels great playing in the suits or warframes feels great the abilities are fun to use and it seems to run fine on my old laptop the game is still being updated and there are events quite often there is actually a story in the game not the best not the worst the game uses a easytouse cardbased modding system to up your abilities weapons etc plus great variety of weapons and warframes everything in the game can be get without purchasing except warframe and weapons slots you get 70 platinum ingame currency to use when starting i recommend spending them on weapon and warframe slots clan system and customisable dojo big and easytouse cardbased modding system to upgrade your gear lots of different planets and missions play with your friends using the ingame invitation system or play with random people via the ingame matchmaking randomly generated levels cons the levels are randomly generated but they look the same a lot the prices in the shop are sometimes absurd a few bugs and glitches here and there but the game is in openbeta some of the mechanics are sometimes unexplained like the parcour mechanic foundy crafting is really irritating joining a session via matchmaking is sometimes pretty irritating and sometimes just doesnt work the game is still receiving updates and new weapons warframes etc i give this game a 8510
recommended
i reccomend to people who likes guns and weapons
recommended
this game is perfect to play with your friends and still fun to play with yourself or with others online 100% free for all the needed parts but pay to get an advantage try it out and youll enjoy it
recommended
i was pleasantly surprised with this one its a great pickupandplay game since i do not have a lot of spare time i love being able to grab a quick halfhour or fifteen minutes having played many playervsplayer games ive found i do prefer coop since it encourages unity rather then turning on each other warframe fits that goal perfectly together everyone achieves more than alone even though the option to solo is there the variety of warframes seems small at first but i quickly learned there are dozens of types and i can see there being a lot of evolution over time as i play this game being able to fight my way through the planets of the solar system is really fun and you can always go back and replay old missions with better equipment that can benefit beginners and veterans alike a great thing about warframe is being able to play it on my hp g56 laptop which is not powerful and yet i turned down half the graphics to minimum that was a mistake and it looked pretty awful then i turned all the settings to minimum including resolution turned off antialiasing and suddenly it looked a lot better so the point is if youre going to turn down the graphics turn all of them down once i did that the game was smooth and i can play without any framerate drops and no detectable lag through wireless connection to a sky fiber modem in the uk all in all a great game that should not be underestimated i can see there being framecons and people reproducing their frames in rl at conventions that seems like fun to me this game should also be made into a liveaction movie i cant wait to find out what happens next oh and the ai is pretty interesting i found myself chuckling at their behaviour which was unexpected five stars

this game is one of the best fps coopperation games i have playedfrom dense action to ninja like silence is the game filled with some bosses have a very unique design and a good back story and few information about their mechanism can turn the table weapons have their own unique mechanism stats and complex design that every weapons i worth a try and mastering the style of use is a key the battle groundneither good or evil the tenno stands never alone against his foes the warframe is the strongest weapon and deep story can hide behind the shell what is known is that they are hunting for us fellows tennos so be on the look outto not get hunted down by the stalker

my favourite steam game definitely worth at least a try i didnt think i would like it at first but then i tried it amazing quality both visually and contentwise does not take an amazing computer to run it
recommended
hello everyone i got two minutes to write a quick thing about this game around the internet you could probably read something good and something bad i think this game definitely deserves the good side of the review first of all the whole engine of warframe is of indie manifacture its an independent project quite successful seriously the whole thing is really light not sources lightness but still and scalable the gameplay is seriously good various combos quick reflexes actions and complexity of combat expecially with some specifical warframe  which is the type of your armor aka your classroleset of skills will keep you intrigued only to see how much combinations you can get with basic attacks the game doesnt use a real cover system there is a flexible system with the objects around the map here comes the first maybe of the few bad thing you cant change your aim side stuck with the character on the left the aim point remains on the center anyway its just a matter of perspective now the second real thing is the level up system youll level up weapons warframes and obviously your account leveling up will unlock more mods slots which are equipped with cards having each a cost going from 2 to 10 the freetoplay system is really cool you cant get anything ingame which you cant obtain without game money at least at the state of thing right now maps arent really vary but theyre critically and intensive opening new areas when you do new missions and also having hazards in the midst of the map fire ice biological things all sorts of things ending this and for too long to read warframe is definitely a free to play third person shooter without pvp for now so the whole cooperative side of the game is true you can obviously try to do missions alone but youll simply and quickly regret that decision did i mention the whole crafting thing has crafting times of a browser mmo and the story unveils quietly surprising too this is great seriously
recommended
great game solo or with a clan its tons of fun youll meet new friends and enemies on your journey master the way of the space ninjas the tenno
recommended
i enjoy this game one of the best free to play games out their at the moment the combat has a flow to it as you switch between shooting and chopping people up the idea is simple but well executed the game requires some patience at the start but once you start leveling its very addicting because of the hoarding and loot that you get later on over all its very enjoyable and i recommend it to any player that wishes to try something slightly new
recommended
new hud every month blur bloom flashing lights expensive colors expensive scarves expensive skins expensive robot parts  network laggy servers ded community im still playing it since alpha so it must be good for something 1010 would go blind again

after watching the legend of the drunken master starring jackie chan and every bruce lee and tony jaa movie known to man i was finally qualified to join the warframe community after picking my first warframe loki i traveled across the stars slaying untold horrors but my blade was sturdy and my spirit strong infested grineer corpus i cut them all down hordes of enemies like a flood would droun me if it werent for my amazing ninja abilities i would have been defeated warframe is amazing and its free only other game on my steam library with over a few hundred played it is well worth it the graphics are just beautiful for such a game and they dont even put stress on your computer the warframe varities levels modifiers weapons and customization leave you satisfied not to mention the many different game modes to choose from and massive amounts of planets to trek across you are a badass ninja fighting through the galaxy with your amazing suit warframe abilities and destructive weapons that can all also be modified with mods you find best free game i know of i highly recomend it

warframes combat is awesome this is a thirdperson shooter where you dash around shooting or slicing your way through robots heavily armoured marines or infested zombielike creatures or you use your powers to stomp so hard they either die or float around discharge thousands of volts into their systems or stab them with a dozen javelins the gameplay doesnt get boring easily you have a variety of enemies to fight against with different game modes to satisfy your desire to either fight endless waves of enemies capture a specific target and more boss battles are interesting with a couple of them now possessing separate battle phases with different required strategies and weakspots to target while the weapon customization can keep you busy creating the best loadout to slaughter different enemies with collecting different frames and weapons allows for a multitude of playstyles too with different focuses depending on how you build your mod loadouts however warframe lacks a story that draws you in sure its fun to kill hordes of ever growing varieties of enemies in different environments and ive enjoyed all that however youre essentially farming for materials to build your frames and weapons with sometimes killing the same boss over and over again hoping that rngesus gives you the drop you want why are you killing this boss well the lotus says this and that while youre on your way to kill him but is there enough lore behind the game not yet sure digital extremes is working on the lore especially with the codex but why not have us live through the backstory a bit more the events are nice adding to the constantly evolving world that warframe is set within but backstorywise warframe lacks the substance that should be there overall warframe is a great free to play game  the only paidonly items are cosmetic or weaponframe slots which you get starting amounts of cash currency platinum to buy a few with and if you insist on not paying a single cent on the game you could always keep building and sell weapons to keep slots free for new content you get relatively frequent updates with developers who actually listen to the players and respond on their forums pay to win is not a problem  this is a coop pve game in essense after all and all the weapons and items can be obtained with enough time and effort and honestly its pretty fun to play ive wasted enough hours of enjoyment on it to say that
recommended
one of the coolest free games ive seen absolutely fantastic reminds me of dead space which is an awesome game which i would like to purchase on steam and re play i like how you dont need to pay for anything and with the packs you can buy they arent overly expensive great gameplay and story
recommended
this game is really fun and its free to play a recent update allows people to build up a dojo which is a housing for your clan where you can perform research build new rooms etc etc as you play you upgrade your gear install new mods onto them and upgrade your mods you can also farm materials and craft equipment and other things from them each warframe has a different set of skills and there are several warframes to play join me in this awesome game and join my dojo
recommended
if you liked the me 3 multiplayer youll love this lovely little f2p game that has a lot of potential in the beta stages
recommended
an extremely fun fast paced and challenging third person shooter different warframes provide a wide variety of play experiences and the number of different mission types and environments stops the core gameplay getting boring definitely worth a try
recommended
great game for a beta it has a few glitches here and there but thats what all betas have right
recommended
the best freetoplay from launch ive ever played this game is fast fun stylish and very enjoyable so much so that i paid for it after the first 40 hours try it out and see if you like it youve got nothing to lose but time

this game is a great oppertunity to burn a few hours and have tons of fun doing it for a game in beta it is fantasticlly built they have a great community and is in a very fast paced setting and its free to play when the developers release an update they pack so full of fixes and additions to the game youd think that they were adding a mod but then again a update is basiclly a mod i enjoy playing this game for two main reasons 1 the fact that it is very fast paced and requires lots of thinking in the now because the ai is very sophisticted and reactes accordingly but could get some improvements 2 the amount of fun that i have just grinding away to get a cool item i personally spent 40 hours grinding away to get two really cool items in the game and i really enjoyed grinding that when i dont know what to do in the game i go and play with my freind the first few missions im now going to write about some minor issues in the game d when i played the tutorial it was preety laggy the first time so you might want to take that time and change settings ive only chrashed twice for no appernt issues but on review of those logs my pc stopped two important files from working but i recommend this game greatlly and i cant wait to see where this game goes
recommended
one of my top games at the moment it is currently in open beta it has been in open beta for a while pros there are very few bugs i have noticed a massive variety of classes weapons and sentinals basically pets that attack accompanies many play styles many ways to travel around freerun stealth charge what ever you like a insane amount of mods cons you can only have 2 warframe slots a warframe is basically your class unless you pay more also a limited number of weapon slots annoying to play without using any money on the game other than the in game lore tab you can read there is no story running hand in hand with the game
recommended
this is very much a pay to win game if you want the good  youve either got to put in many hours of gameplay and crafting or you can simply buy all the advanced equipment straight off the bat its certainly not a bad game just a very reptitive one
recommended
free to play still in beta but worth a try if you havent checked it out yet great aesthetic addictive and visceral gameplay that manages to be smooth and fluid lots of variety in play really worth a shot and free so what have you got to lose
recommended
so far this has been my favorite free to play title the amount of time ive poured into this since i started is kind of insane
recommended
many gamers have that game the game that you will spend hours on farming for one item the game that you would willingly spend more time than sleeping on for me that game is warframe i origianally started warframe as a skeptic the name is somewhat vague and the gameplay looked fairly ordinary however the pathetically high number of hours i have logged are evidence of why im glad i stuck with it warframe calls itself a beta so they can get away with major changes to the game that a full game wouldnt that being said i havent seen an update i disagreed with not even the almost complete rewrite of the damage system it was a wierd adjustment but i feel it works better now if you want a game that is a full polished product then you should skip over warframe the name itself is a little strange that is until you get into the game when it is explained a warframe is the armor that you a tenno wear into battle each warframe is equipped with unique and powerful abilities these abilities include a time shattering stomp invisibility setting the world on fire and sooo much more on top of these insane powers you bring weapons into battle as well a primary weapon which can be a rifle shotgun sniper laser cannon or even a bow and arrow your secondary can be a pistol dual or single wield a hand crossbow throwing knives and theres even an exploding gel gun for chrissakes the melee weapons get just as fun there are of course swords and daggers but you can also wield an energy whip dual hand axes or a freakin hammer there is very little pvp in warframe its really just for settling big  contests and for friends to test their new gear the game is entirely based around pve whether youre slaughtering an endless horde or trying to take out one specific vip theres always something to shoot smash and generally  up if youve read this farthank you but despite my praise there are a couple cons to this game as well the game can be hard to start for one thing the beginner weapons are beyond noobish and if you pick the experienced warframe as your starter and dont like himleveling up will be a complete pain in the  adjusting to third person can also be a problem for some playersit was for me another problem i do have though is with the grinding there is a lot sometimes you need one material to make the last piece for your new warframe and you just cant get it this can get demoralizing but just take a break play something else for a day or two and come back fresh also tramwork is sometimes in short supply many players are just grinding for materials or trying to finish off a planet because of this you rarely find anyone who will run with you this is less of a problem it could be thanks to independant looting if a rare mod is dropped its there for everyone and most players will run back to revive you should you down if you want to talk thoughyou had better have some friends all in all warframe is a great game that never really gets old the devs keep in regular contact with the gaming community to fin the problems and fix them as well as cranking out new updates with weapons and events on a regular basisi honestly think de could charge people to play warframe you wont regret downloading this gem

action packed to the letter definately worth a playthrough if you love incredibly smooth controls that guide you into cleaving a fascist clone in twain also comes with rogues necromancers clerics fighters paladins various mages of the elements and giant diseased dogs

if youve seen me on steam at all recently youve seen me playing waframe its a great game it is a great example of how to do f2p you can do everything in this game without ever paying a dime if you want to work for it if youd rather put money then time into getting gear thats possible too everything that the pay currency can be used for in some way is a shortening of time yes once again time  money the action is fast fluid and fun space ninjas that line should sell itself ever want to do a wall run flip off and take out three enemies as you fly over their heads this is your game the movement system is probably the best you will ever play its still beta and its not hard to find the beta points but its already a ton of fun and things keep being added more polish and this will be the best game ever

wonderful graphics good gameplay joining random games is not suggested when starting out play alone or with friends one of the key point i enjoy of this game is the amount of customization you can have 4 of the same warframes tennos in the same match and can still all be completely different due to mod card customization its a fun game maps can get confusing but it takes some getting used to as do most games i give it a 45 also you can get blueprints to build your own weaponsarmorwarframes instead of buying them with creditsin game currency or platinumrealmoney

warframe is a scifi based thirdperson shooter it is a very fun game with replayable stealthy or action played levels coop mode is very fun and interactive apart from the fact people steal my kills >< other than that i like how i can change my armor customize my weapons and use different colors on my character and my trusty blade me personally i like to play it stealthy on all missions but if youre not that type thats your way of playing  overall i love this game with its parkour aspects where as i can run across walls to get to the other side of a pit of lava or acid and i can climd up on a box to straddle over a railing to find myself six feet from an enemy very fun and lots of cool features i highly reccomend it to shooter fans

this game is quite awesome for being a freetoplay title fastpaced action a levelingmodification system with depth and spacealienninjas what else could you want

it is awesome please play

fun as hell just be sure to bring your friends along for the ride

for being in an open beta stage warframe is an amazing game to play it is really fun but sure it takes some time and effort to get into it that is if you craft or earn everything in some aspects people can view it as a paytowin kind of game but people tend to craft more than buy besides blueprints you can craft every single item in the game too and some of which you can craft you cannot buy but anyway i am not about to go into a full depth description of the game to make a long story short warframe is awesome
recommended
amazing game slow at first but quickly speeds up highly recomended
recommended
really like it so far best free to play game ive tried on steam
recommended
great game great customization and replayability
recommended
game is difficult to start out with but once you understand the flow of the game it defines entertainment do note that this game might become repetitive after so long however constantly getting new equipment will mostly remove the dull of repetition
recommended
when it come to freetoplay warframe really stands out everything in the game except for exclusive offers that do not make the game paytowin can either be purchased with either time or money if you want a character asap you can purchase them or if youre more patient you can find all the parts and build them yourself everything from the combat to the graphics have been done amazingly and are always being improved ive watched this game develop over the past year and its almost unbelievable what this game has transformed into i missed the chance to become a founder and everyday i regret it theres a huge variety of weapons warframes characters powers each warframe has their own power ups maps and game styles that make warframe addicting they have recently added challenges that are loads of fun to play with others online that greatly pay off they have also listened to their fans and have added pvp matches even when they said they did not see pvp in their vision of warframe the developers know what theyre doing and their ears are open to their players if you have not played warframe yet then i highly suggest that you get on it right now this game is so much fun and can be even more fun if you play with your friends if you have played warframe but its been a few months then you should give it another chance there have been many updates and the game has been improved in every way
recommended
warframe is one of my favorite games it has some of my favorite things lots of guns swords and anything to fit your style tons of costomization play with frinds play alone very graphic free crafting rp hard
recommended
this game is kinda fun
recommended
awsome game you should get this i have the worst computer and it runs really well
recommended
this game is very fun it was one of the first f2p i tried and honestly its one of my favorite you play a a in space ninja running on walls awesome tile sets fun clan system fun to just mess around in the clan or the void only dowsides is that some weapons are clan research or some are only possible to get though the use of platinum which is real money and that once you farm for dayz to get the needed resources you must wait for either 12 hours up to 72 hours or 3 days to get the item you farmed for dayz to get but other than that i think it is an awsome game well worth the time you spend on it
recommended
warframe can be buggy at times but the devs are always coming out with new content and hotfixes warframe has a bit of a steep learning curve and can seem confusing at first to understand the damage mechanics of the game but there are plenty of tutorials online and there are few guys within the comminity who create really excellent videos that can help you understand the different weapons and warframes and how to mod them the game can be quite grindy but the rewards are sometimes worth it i personally love playing warframe it has a futuristic feeling with a large and ever growing assortment of weapons and gear to chose from and the game is quite challenging you can play parts of this game solo but it can become very diificult at higher levels so you must work as a team in order to finsih missions would i recommend this game  yes i do recommend this game and quite highly it is not for everyone but it is free so you have nothing to lose by trying it out for yourself
recommended
this is the best fps game i have ever played 1010
recommended
this game is all about shooting killing  and sneaking and if your that type of person you should get this game
recommended
good game lighting isnt the best though and it could be improved a bit
recommended
im not reccomending this game because of its core dynamics farm fo dayz im reccomending it because it can be something better within the coming yearsmonths my only plea is that they make sure that the main story line is good for holding out for so long and to decrease some mod drop rates and to decrease the time needed to create warframesweapons this game has a lot of potential and i enjoy watching it grow
recommended
warframe is a very nice looking game with pretty decent performance compared to the graphics this game may take some time to get used to but in the end it will become very fun there are lots of items to craft and collect and lots of weapons and warframes to choose from 8510

warframe is a coop game up to 4 players inwhich the player choses 3 warframes upfront being vangaurd volt and loki to start their adventure through the galaxy you are an ancient warrior designed to do specific tasks you will go through levels solo or with your team completing various objectives finding loot and leveling up your gear and it never gets boring the levels randomize every single time so you will never play the same map on any level though only 3 warframes can be used for free upfront that does not mean they are the worst some consider them to be the most powerful or atleast equal to the others in their various playstyles there are roughly 68 other warframes currently which can be made in real time 3days by blue print bought from the marketplace with credits and parts dropped from bosses or platinum bought with real money platinum is extremely expensive and i do not reccomend buying it to get a warframe or gear youll be able to craft everythingas far as im aware though it will take some time you save the money in your pockets trust me ive made this mistake there are tons of things to keep the player intwined with this game for hours between difficult missions random events and playing with their friends the only cons about this game thus far are the high priced platinum and the beta stage bugs that occure but not very often it seems that each day there are bug fixes there is much more to be described about this game but due to the lack of space i have left >> i can not go over everything another con that some might not like is how long it takes to level your avatar ive spent well over 12 hours and im only lvl 1 though everything availiable to you right now only needs lvl 2 your avatar lvl is seperate from the gear lvl which goes much faster and maxes out at 30from what ive heard for a free to play game and a quick download i highly reccomend this for you and your friends

`warframe` is a very good game and slightly like prince of persia where you can sprint across walls the reason why i think this game is good is because you can purchase weapons and most of all play and enjoy all of the missionsi would definately recommend this game to any sort of player
recommended
fastpaced high octane space ninja action what more could you want i mean come on space ninjas
recommended
the best f2p game i have ever had in fact the best game i have ever had in general runs really well on all but the worst computers
recommended
warframe has incredibly imursive gameplay it is free to play and is not pay to win sure you can unlock most things much quicker but everything in the game is accessible without paying except for skins which is really cool the multiple experiance systems really brings a strong dynamic of replayablity and scaling to the game
recommended
this game is pretty fun but i would say its kinda easy maybe make it a little less predictable
recommended
for a free to play game it is simply amazing the amount of customization and changing gameplay beats many paytoplay that i own the best part is this title is not built around model where you are forced to pay $ to progress everything can be created through collecting resources and money put 20 hours and still finding new types of missions and more features that i didnt know were in the game
recommended
warframe is a f2p game based on a story of a forgotten civilization who awakento stop the forces of the enemy that grew this game is all about playing for fununlocking new content having a clan  socialize with people and more fun this game is a teambased game  with a coop feature  a private feature and a solo featureyou begin as a poor tennothen you will become a master of the old ways you will find yourself with other people hunting for rare items or even going to kill the bosses that terrorized their armythis game if fun i recommend it if you want a help you can contact me in game w ufcolonel and me and my clan will assist you d
recommended
this game is seriously the best free to play game i have seen come out in awhile its really fun being able to play with your friends or just others online however i noticed that plaing solo can be challenging for new players and the whole upgrading your warframe weapons etc isnt very clear it took me about a week to finally figure out how upgrades really work and how you use them the graphics on this game are amazing even at the lowest setting the levels never really get boring and its chalk full of different ways to play me personally i like to sneak around and kill unsuspecting enemies overall the game is a well put together game note this is a 3rd person so keep that in mind based on your preference if they had put this game up for sale i would buy it thats how great this game is even if your not a 3rd person kind of player i suggest downloading it and just play 1 or 2 rounds youll understand why there is so much hype for this new game now the other con to this game is that many of your weapon arsenal will have to be paid with real world money which is sometimes for those budget gamers a pain in the  but they give you an option to buy a blueprint find all the things needed to build it and then actually build it this doesnt cost real worl money but it costs game money which is fairly easy to obtain once you really get into the game you really wont notice that your gun is bad in fact they can stand a really good chance against most enemys so having a new gun isnt a must have you can make your warframe look amazing you choose skins and all different kinds of things you start with 50 p and later you would have to go buy more with actual money if you want to customize more hope this helps you guys out

really awesome game full of ninjas
recommended
have you ever wanted to be a ninja how about a samurai how about in spaaaaace well too bad youre not but if you play warframe you can be fling fireballs cut things with swords throw kunais electrocute your enemies run across walls and even get repeatedly bounced into the air in this squadbased missionbased overtheshoulder shooter and maybe have some fun while youre at it you stickinthemud

one of the best free to play games ive ever had the fortune to play plenty of guns warframes and enemies to keep you busy for a long time and the story is great over 100 weapons classified between primary secondary and melee and you can change the way each weapon acts by modding them with 8 of 250 modules the classes in this game are the different warframes that you collect and build giving you different skills and stats that help you depending on the mission your trying to complete allowing for you to play whatever role you wish be it stealth healer support tank or just plain old damage and once you have completed the main missions in the solar system there is the void and derelects to clear and loot giving you wealth and power it also has no pay to win you actually never have to pay a cent in your entire career as you can trade modules for the real money currency platinum i did this over a 1 week period and made 50$ worth of platinum i found playing this game solo was pretty boring being much more enjoyable with atleast 1 other person but you can have groups of 4 which is very interesting trying to compete for the most damage done or simply just destroying all the enemies standing in your way another great aspect of the game is the deep storyline which you can read all about on the wiki or simply read codex entries inside the game personal rating 455
recommended
really good at pinching
recommended
do you like an intense storyline too bad do you like epic characters deal with it do you like space ninjas with freakin assult rifles pistols and an op meelee weapons this is the game for you
recommended
this game is bad  and its free give me a reason you dont want to play it

this game is amazing i love all the weapons and the customization of your warframe and there is a lot to do in the game like going to all planes and you can builed weapons and you can get mods for your weapons and warframe there is a lot to do on it you will be up all night have fun and be the best ninja warframe you can be
recommended
if you like grindingfarming  space ninja style warframe is a game for you if not dont bother downloading at all
recommended
this a great game and fun to play with friends the powers acrobatic and gunplay and swordplay are amazing but this game is money hungry to get weapons and different classes youll have to to wait and pay alot of ingame currency and it tempts you to buy another ingame currency that you have to buy with real life money which allows to buy weapon and classes and not have to wait hours to make if you can look past not having all the great weaponsnot the best at the begining or for a little while this game is for you
recommended
the best online shooter ive ever played
recommended
ive been playing this game since way back in march 13 and warframe has come along way it is still as grindy as ever but it is also still great fun to try out new weaponsframes and mess about with friends and randoms alike this game is improving all the time and i cant wait to see where it will go in the future you should at the very least give it a try as it is free
recommended
this game is really fun and very addictive everything on the game is achievable all have fun
recommended
this is a great free game ive spent so much time playing this game that my real life problems just seemed to disapear such as money women and activeness this game is an amazing looking game that when i feel like going outside i just go on the earth map and stare at the sun but for not to long because i dont want to go blind the relistic feeling about being outside is really amazing that it hurts less that i havent left my house in 3 years but overall this game is amazing it would be awasome if i had people to play it with but everybody just isnt as cool as me
recommended
great game

its ninjas in space and cool abilities
recommended

super ing awesome

warframe is an action packed alienninja game that is combines a strange passion for weapons
recommended
i like warframe because its fun and awesome
recommended
extremely fun particularly with friends new tilesets are being added almost every update and where once there were a handful of reused levels theyre moving rapidly towards one or several unique looks for every planetary sector player customization while unfortunately heavily cashgated is constantly growing weapon variety is everything you could want and again is still growing enemies and bosses are varied and even with that variety the devs have confirmed a fourth hostile faction to be added at a later date in short this game has quite a few strong points that grow stronger with every update one caveat be prepared to exercise either patience or your credit card new stuff is either crafted very slowly or bought for an assload of dosh i can forgive the bugs because its still open beta and they do correct them fairly quickly however the frankly absurd exchange rate of platinum versus actual goods bought hurts it in my opinion as that gating has turned almost a dozen of my friends off from joining 810
recommended
this game is ridiculous
recommended
what can i say about warframe that hasnt already been said space ninjas grinding awesome combat thanks to melee 20 look it up or better yet play it i would recommend joining a clan though the best gear is clan research the grinding can be reduced by buying boosters or actually buying the items from the store however thats horrifically expensive and makes me think that the devs want you to grind and play the game the shops there for the few impatient people who need everything and need it now tldr play it its free
recommended
game owns
recommended
the best game of all time and guess what its free
recommended
this is a great ftp game with ways to earn all the weapons and suits that you want the paid transactions allow you to gain access to items faster cosmetic items and credit and affinity xp boosters but in a game that is mostly about cooperation it does not affect the overall balance the developer is good about getting out bug fixes on a regular basis as well as the major updates the overall community is great and are very helpful there are a great variety of maps throughout the whole game as well as weapons and character types there is some pvp elements but they are still a work in progress the only issues that have cropped up are the random and sometimes amusing bugs and some of the newer areas they add do not have a lot of areas to randomize and they will repeat more often than not overall this is a great game for coop play and well worth any time and if you so choose money
recommended
this is one of the best free to games that i have ever played basically its about space ninjas and every ninja has its own powers and stats you can also build your own weapons which is really fun to do because you have to travel to all differant places to get the resources required to make the item you want the game gives you a lot of things to do but it is a little rough to get into totally deserves a better rating
recommended
is rly gud
recommended
this game is freakin sweet if you have the desire to level things this is the game for you it almost feels endless
recommended
its an awsum rpg game i love the gameplay and its a very extensive game amazing graphics and playthroughs ive already logged in almost 50 hours in a weeks lol

probably my favorite free game our there right now others include path of exile ghost recon online league of legends and loadout this is a great example of how the business model in a f2p game should be any item that you can buy for real money you can easily get for free anything that you cant get for free is purely cosmetic graphics are great for a free game and crafting a new gun or warfame just never seems to get boring it is kind of a grindfest though and after spending almost 200 hours into this im starting to get burnt out its still in beta and ive heard that the devs are gonna start to change things a bit make it more interesting as it stands now its a must play its free so theres nothing to lose 
recommended
ever played mass effect 3 multiplayer this is very similar except it most of the game modes are more akin to dungeon runs than static defense that being said shooty stabby space ninja super funtime is quite entertaining very fast paced gameplay
recommended
its fun to pass the time and having patience will get you anything in the game
recommended
this game really has gotten my attention it probably has all i could ask for it has tons of action an rpg mechanic which makes you want to farm those mods to become more poweful play with friends levelup gain new weapons and warframes and rank the  up 
recommended
game type mmo  third person  free2play but in a good way  shooter  hack and slash  rpg this one is very different from most pay2plays out there you can reliably get almost anything ingame that you could want i am sure there are one or two things only available to people who have paid money into the game but any weapon or warframe worth having can drop during the game all without endlessly farming for the same materials you can end up with great weapons skills and warframes the games answer to a suit of mech armor i guess just by playing the game regularly no extra obnoxious farming although you will probably be farming for hours anyways levelling up your everything is key to having the most powerful weapons and skills skills oh my god if i could describe how the skills can vary from person to person warframe to warframe weapon to weapon it would take me a degree in math and i would still have to write an entire article in order to describe it a tutorial would take an entire wiki you level up your account on a fairly regular basis but can only take the test to level up once every 24hrs this however doesnt impede your ability to progress and make gains on your characterframeweapon combination as each fight may drastically alter the way that you choose to play your game permanently or perhaps just for certain missions anyways its been said before but never by me the possibilities are nearly endless they are legitimately endless if development continues on the game and the growth is exponential with each update no need to worry about micspamming kids in this game the voicechat is nearly unusable and encourages the use of teamspeak my advice get a group together either irl friends or use the lobby to quickly put together a squad of unstoppable ninja and get into this game its the only way youll understand and remember when playing  the wiki is written by people with experience and will save you hours of potentially wasted time good luck and honestly try it out you will probably like it
recommended
space ninjas you cant beat it
recommended
its a very fun game its repetitive at times but theres a very steady stream of new content and it always adds variety the visuals are sleek and the combat feels really cool its definitely worth playing for that coolfactor alone its also a very enjoyable multiplayer experience with friends
recommended
theres a reason warframe is a launch title for the ps4 honestly its probably for all the pretty particles thatll be flying around when you cut space marines in half with your space ninja sword while sliding on the ground after wallrunning from across the map because you are a space ninja with all the powers of space ninjutsu in all seriousness this game is fantastic not because of the terrific graphics not because the co op with different warframe you character with a set of stats and powers that allow for great synergy between teammates but because this game gets free 2 play at no point have i felt the need to pay for the game but i have because i like it a lot everything can be aquired without real world money and it all seems fair and balanced this is a brilliant game and i recommend it to anyone looking for a great co op game or something to really show off to next gen console friends
recommended
this game honestly wasnt what i epected when i started playing i figured oh an action mmo so were looking at a massive world full of people all doing random quests only with guns wrong the world is divided into small maps that you play with teams and completing each map unlocks the next the combat is fast requiring you to go back and forth between shooting things to slicing them up with melee attacks the sheer depth of customization options you have is astounding and the way that skills are handled is a nice addition the graphics themselves are nice and players can drop in to a map in the middle of play so you may start a map with only you and another player but end it with 45 people there is an element of grind present as to manufacture gear once you have the blueprints you need materials for which youll either have to pay platinum the realmonet currency or play maps over a few times to get what you need from enemy drops easier to do on survival levels also leveling up yourself is a seperate things from leveling weapons and frames and ranking up as a player requires completing challenges which you need to wait 24 hours to try again if you fail i have a few problems with the game first youre kind of thrown to the wolves when it comes to initialy setting up your character but the wiki helps secondly i feel that while the graphics are wonderful and the visuals themselves nicely done the biomechanical look of the game could have been done better thats not to say that it looks like crap just that the disproportionate bodies of the enemies can look out of place compared to the avatars of the you and the other players sometimes the game wont remember the mods ive added to weaponsframes after i exit that menu but that might be something im doing wrong and not the game itself youre best option if you try the game and enjoy it is to buy the $40 starter pack youll seriously need the ingame and real money currencies as well as the other bonuses to help get yourself started otherwise youre stuck with the most basic of basic gear for quite a long time
recommended
this is the best free game on steam ive ever seen d
recommended
i love this game its well made good graphics and fighting mechanics all bugs are dealt with quickly so they arent much of a problem a wide range of missions well suited for leveling up as it doesnt rise too fast nor too slow a massive selection of weapons with challenges to get the materials to craft them adds even more fun to the game i really do recommend this game to my friends and the public especially since it is a great game for being free get it now youre missing out on all the ninja fun
recommended
the first thing to notice is how nice the graphics look especially for a free to play game you get to play as a tenno a kind of a space ninja which is pretty darn cool there are many weapons to craft and use and even more mods to upgrade them with when you find the blueprints for a new warframe you can craft it and play with a new character each character has a different playstyle also depending on what mods you decide to equip running trough the missions and blasting and cutting our way trough the enemies feels good not much communication happening in multiplayer everyone just races to the finish thankfully players can still be very helpfull the game is still in beta and many things need some work such as droprates lag and mob balance missions can feel repetitive because most levels look the same the rooms are always randomly connected to eachother so the layout is different it is possible to finish the game without spending real money on it but it will take a bit longer it is free so why not give it a try and see for yourself
recommended
impressive parcore and long ranged combat personally i love having the melee combat in a game like this it adds a whole new realm of combinations that are available to the user
recommended
this game is really easy to play and fun for the first few hours but eventually itll get very repetative either way you can get a good few hours out of this at best and its free d
recommended
great game get this game its fun to play with friends
recommended
it is the awesome game ever but it has some complications to it you use chips to buy responds if you die in the game you respond back but eventually you waste those chips and you have to use real money to buy more and i love the game but please who ever made it get rid of the buy more chips it is super annoying

there is a voice inside me somewhere deep down in the fossilising lobes of my brain resides an eager mouth that calls in from my past it is a youthful me filled with irrational exuberance it looks at the art and scifi glamourgloom of warframe and says this is the stuff

warframe is a coop thirdperson action shooter the player is given a nice variety of weapons they can work towards though knew warframes will be what you spend most of your time working for this is as this is a very heavily grind based game and you will revisit the same missions over and over depending on what you need to make your next item the acrobatic mechanics add a very nice ascpect to the combat allowing flips and wallruns all of this is very nice but in the games current state it lacks variety in enemy an missions an the lore which seems very nice is given to you very lightly leaving the best part of the game obfuscated warframe 710 good what is stalker
recommended
this game will just keep you entertained for hours on end sure its a f2p game and really tries to get you to spend money on it but the hours and hours spent grinding for that god damn gallium was sure worth it i would like to thank the devs for this great game

warframe uses an interesting combat style that includes the use of maneuvers like wallrunning and walljumping that add to the skills one can have in combat these maneuvers are complemented by the large assortment of weapons that range from traditional weapons in shooter games like assault rifles and pistols to weapons like bows and throwing stars that have been upgraded to fit the futuristic scifi theme of the game one thing that must be noted about this impressive arsenal is that while one must pay money to buy ingame currency platinum to buy most weapons and warframes these same items can be just as easily built through the purchase of blueprints in the ingame market using credits earned from completing missions or by using blueprints found during missions i am not normally the type to pay in places where it is not needed so having this option appealed greatly to me on a negative note i feel that at this point the stages and enemies are overly uniform with not enough variation between planets and individual stages though at this point there have been changes made to some of the stages and enemies and i assume that more individualism will be seen between them especially considering that at the point that i am writing this the game is still in beta also the fact that the stages are generated differently each time it is played helps to keep it from seeming too much the same as well as keeping it fresh instead of being able to just memorize stages i have enjoyed my experiences with warframe so far and i would recommend it to others who may be on the fence about playing this actionfilled game

you can run up walls and shoot things gg 1010 would play again

best free to play game out

i could write essays about this game but instead ill go ahead and recommend it its actually one of my best f2p games on steam86100

this game is very well done for a beta hell this might just be the best thirdperson freetoplay game i have ever played most of the things in here are grindable so you dont have to spend real money to get everything you need so good luck tenno

good graphics different playmodes cool interfase and free to play d

this game honestly wasnt what i epected when i started playing i figured oh an action mmo so were looking at a massive world full of people all doing random quests only with guns wrong the world is divided into small maps that you play with teams and completing each map unlocks the next the combat is fast requiring you to go back and forth between shooting things to slicing them up with melee attacks the sheer depth of customization options you have is astounding and the way that skills are handled is a nice addition the graphics themselves are nice and players can drop in to a map in the middle of play so you may start a map with only you and another player but end it with 45 people there is an element of grind present as to manufacture gear once you have the blueprints you need materials for which youll either have to pay platinum the realmonet currency or play maps over a few times to get what you need from enemy drops easier to do on survival levels also leveling up yourself is a seperate things from leveling weapons and frames and ranking up as a player requires completing challenges which you need to wait 24 hours to try again if you fail i have a few problems with the game first youre kind of thrown to the wolves when it comes to initialy setting up your character but the wiki helps secondly i feel that while the graphics are wonderful and the visuals themselves nicely done the biomechanical look of the game could have been done better thats not to say that it looks like crap just that the disproportionate bodies of the enemies can look out of place compared to the avatars of the you and the other players sometimes the game wont remember the mods ive added to weaponsframes after i exit that menu but that might be something im doing wrong and not the game itself youre best option if you try the game and enjoy it is to buy the $40 starter pack youll seriously need the ingame and real money currencies as well as the other bonuses to help get yourself started otherwise youre stuck with the most basic of basic gear for quite a long time
recommended
this is the best free game on steam ive ever seen d
recommended
i love this game its well made good graphics and fighting mechanics all bugs are dealt with quickly so they arent much of a problem a wide range of missions well suited for leveling up as it doesnt rise too fast nor too slow a massive selection of weapons with challenges to get the materials to craft them adds even more fun to the game i really do recommend this game to my friends and the public especially since it is a great game for being free get it now youre missing out on all the ninja fun
recommended
the first thing to notice is how nice the graphics look especially for a free to play game you get to play as a tenno a kind of a space ninja which is pretty darn cool there are many weapons to craft and use and even more mods to upgrade them with when you find the blueprints for a new warframe you can craft it and play with a new character each character has a different playstyle also depending on what mods you decide to equip running trough the missions and blasting and cutting our way trough the enemies feels good not much communication happening in multiplayer everyone just races to the finish thankfully players can still be very helpfull the game is still in beta and many things need some work such as droprates lag and mob balance missions can feel repetitive because most levels look the same the rooms are always randomly connected to eachother so the layout is different it is possible to finish the game without spending real money on it but it will take a bit longer it is free so why not give it a try and see for yourself
recommended
impressive parcore and long ranged combat personally i love having the melee combat in a game like this it adds a whole new realm of combinations that are available to the user
recommended
fun to play with other people d
recommended
this seems like a good game i havent played for very long but i beat the first couple levels with a friend of mine all i can say is that its a fun game especially with an xbox controller
recommended
fun if you can handle some repetitiveness
recommended
make this game in mac plz not on mac but fun
recommended
this game is probably one of the best mmos out there its very amazing to play with friends and just as fun when you solo as well the gameplay is quite addicting to the very point that itll constantly draw you back into the mix if this appeals to you in any way the beginning like most games is quite the grind fest but once you get past that point it only gets better while melee is not the best in this game they offer quite a wide variety of weapons and warframes which signify the classes the game can get quite tedious but try to look past that and youll be addicted just as easily as i am my only complaint about this game is that there are so many weapons and warframes that i cant have them all because you need platinum to buy slots which they generously give you 50 to start out with for extra warframe or weapons slots if you enjoy playing with friends this is the game to download teamwork needs to be handled very carefully or you can end up failing a mission that you could have easily won while the game doesnt have the best soundtrack it makes up for it with the ambiance id recommend you to try this game at least once if you are curious about it
recommended
overall a very very good game great graphics epic and intense combat and wellspace ninjas aside from some bugs here and there my only complaint is the levels get repetative but its not a game breaker for me highly recomend this game its a lot more fun then it looks and it already looks really fun
recommended
its an amazing looking game with great mechanics i love the feeling of being a space ninja in the middle of a solar system war i rate this game a 910 smackaroos unfortunately even on the lowest settings i still get the occasional lag spikes when my computer cant handle the graphics
recommended
cybernetic ninjasevents and constant updatesthe developers are keeping this alive and i am pretty damn happy about how far they have come with all the content that has been added to the game itself
recommended
this game is just awesome you can choose from just a few weapons when you start but then you have the chance to craft your own weapons and there are like alot the graphics are awesome too about how it looks and how efficient they are you can easily get 40 fps with a fairly old computer the detail i personally like is that its not p2w atleast not completely if you get kia you can spend a revive wich is bought from the market or you can be revived by a teammate in coop the only things i dont like about it are the unstability of the game servers and just a few bugs in the connection system and in the steam launcher
recommended
one of the bestif not the bestf2p games ive played to get this out of the way this game is not pay 2 win in fact the best gear is only obtained through playing cannot be bought warframe strongly encourages working in a team though that doesnt mean that you cant go solo theres a whole option dedicated to that and with a large list of weapons and warframes to choose from therell always be something to do the only bad thing i could say is that if youre looking for a story or indepth game this is definitely not for you the missions will get tedious for those that dont like killing things over and over again still it is a very well developed game that delivers several hours of ninja fun
recommended
this game is great plus its free the game is fast paced and hard
recommended
its a game you dont always have to play to advance in but it has to build stuff like clash of clans if you do play warframe which you should join my clan
recommended
good game  but craft is bad
recommended
a very good games it has a lot of potential but it is ruied by a none fluid gameplay and of course a pay to win systeme 610
recommended
hey you have to try this game out pretty standard and easy plus online play is fun
recommended
holy crap this is as good as f2p gets there are 3 basic weapon types melee primary and secondary each unique i give this game a 1010 i run a good 60 fps and the graphics are outstanding for free to play
recommended
its sexy good time
recommended
no reason not to recommened this great visuals fast and fluent gameplay and some awesome animations and whats more its a free to play nonpaytowin in my opinion 810
recommended
think of castlevania hd on the xbox its the type of game that you would not enjoy if you are playing it solo however add a couple of friends in the mix and you got yourself a rootin tootin time the game lacks a true story mode or a single player experiance but makes up for it in the sheer amount of content various types of mission have you and your friends going through shooting baddies and collecting material to build your next mass murdering machine the game even has boss battles that put your warframes and gear to the limit although the game free to play f2p most content can be obtained with a little effort on your part you can even go as far as selling that hard to find mod modification cards to increase the stats of warframes or weapons or insanely difficult blueprint used to craft new material and obtain money from a willing buyer in the community that can be used to obtain weapon slots to add more weapons to your arsenal or buy some cosmetic items to make your warframe a fashionable kililng machine theres nothing to lose when playing this game so it wont hurt to give it a try like said before this game would be geared towards someone who is looking for that new multiplayer experiance with friends
recommended
i have put near 500 hours in to this if that says any thing about it a masterful game with strong game play and with a high skill cap plenty of gear and levels to play war frame is best played with buddys and id recommend dropping five or ten bucks on it and forgetting the free to play you can earn any thing in the game by playing events offer any thing from new guns to cosmetic items but buy plat will make getting started a lot more easy the only draw back to warframe is the truly insane crafting times to build new frames a and clan gear but that is vastly out matched by its meany other achievements at its base warframe was made by people and scott who love ninjas and space and robots and zombies and pirates and made the perfect combination hack and slash and shot and space magic with rougelike elements and rpg to bring you warframe a game about having fun

so much to to in a free to play game is amazing 1010

great and funny game recommending it
recommended
being a warframe is badass the path of a tenno is violent and satisfying progression feels naturally paced as a free user i dont feel like im really missing out it can be played solo but is much more fun with people even random strangers its really easy to get into a game with others events where you have a limited time to complete a mission keep things fresh are very rewarding often giving access to realmoneyonly items  mitigating the need to spend real money ie there is no need badsides occasionally games are laggy though thankfully this is rare there is no player versus player but that hasnt bothered me to much the bosses can be real bullet soakers some of them take a long time to kill the mission types can wind up feeling generic yet despite the fact that all you do is kill hordes of enemies it still feels fun certain keybindings are less responsive than others i had trouble with the e key binding for melee but when i switched it  i had no issues the controller doesnt have this issue yet i prefer mouse and keyboard in this game
recommended
910 this game is just fun to play also a bit addictive since you cant stop getting more gear and customizing your warframe ingame character i give it a 9 because at the beggining its a bit overwhelming for new players so many features and options not to mention things to do anyways i played in an old account after dropping this game some time ago and may be thats why it was so overwhelming its free fun and the community is great give it a try
recommended
yes it is repetadive as hell yes the diffaculty ramps very fast no your levels means almost nothing well picking maps yes they want you to spend real money to get anything cool fast yes the knockdown stackdamage is uc<ing stupid yeah the whole ninjalasergunningswordswingingflying bs is kind of hard to get use too but eh this is a super casual mmofps i would not recommend this if your about compatition or quick satisfaction from anything other then slicing some dude in 12 well getting lead sprayed at your backside edit forgot to say you must wait a real 12 to 24 hours for most things to complete or for a chance to do them again take that how ever you like

warfrmae is a game ive been following since alpha and like many other games i never loose intrest in playing it yes this game isnt for those who just want it all now an not wait but i think that the grind and trial to obtain warframes without using real money makes the warframe that more rewardable the game just amazes me every day its one of the only games that actually feel like a living breathing world every weekend has a new global event where the developers have us go up against a grineer vs corpus rivalry or a sneaky corpus tradesmans escort every warframe adds a new field to play with within the randomly generated levels and i love all the customization and loadouts that are avaliable you can play how you want to play be a tanky rhino and destroy the fron lines or a nova who assists the whole team in a damage amplifier or be a sneaky assasin like loki or ash and stealth an entire mission oh and dont get me started on u11 in the lastest update they have added more amazing rooms and decoration to the clan built dojos alot of the content in warframe is not visble at first glance but if more people gave this game a chance i promise they would love it plus its free  btw i play warfame from the website and not through steam i actually have 450 hrs on the game not 19 hrs  
recommended
this game is seriously addicting it has a ton of different elements from almost every game type there is which is incredible immense customization innumerable combinations of weapons and mods this game really has it all
recommended
awsome game d
recommended
you can play with the spaceship on the loading screen 1010

once i had regained my password warframe had still turned out to be a grind you will spend ages rerunning levels and hoping for drops for specific pieces or patterns to unlock equipment for those of you with fat wallets and little time to earn the gear legitimately you can pay to unlock the weapons its a bit of a shame none of the vanity items can be earned in game though luckily the game is still fun in a very visceral sense gunning down grunts while they swarm at you on defensive missions is one of the best parts though it does appear theyve rebalance a large portion of the game since i last played the emergence of a story that does not require you to go browsing forums and creators notes is refreshing as well 710 would be better if you didnt have to spend so damn long or so damn much to unlock some of the gear seriously stop charging so damn much

starts slow but honestly this is a diamond in the rough a game that needs to be played to be understood i never knew i what fun it was to play a space ninja but after about 15 hours its got a few hooks in me and not bad for free im in my mid twenties in rank with the starter gear and am pondering the grind for new equipment or simply cashing out and having $10 or $20 to ride on for a while the missions of mercury are a bit dull but once you get the venus the missions open up a bit and become a bit more engaging in terms of polish it isnt the shiniest stone but it isnt the buggiest by far i would put it on par with a payday 2 or tribes ascend sort of feel
recommended
grate game love it nbetter on ps4 but its fun
recommended
the fact that you have to read this in order to understand the level of amazingness that comes from this game may god have mercy on your soul if you like completlely custom game play with ablility to build every thing you can buy all within a free gameeach game mode even while farming missions is completely different great graphics even when compared to a buyable game and a community of helpful peopleand other stuffs then this isnt your game because your too busy reading what other people think about it have some faith my childdownload it add me on steam i can personally tell you how awesome this game is either way your lack of faith is disturbing
recommended

oh boy another ftp game bet its pay to win im pretty sure thats what youre thinking right now but i would possibly come over slap you with a glove and say no wellit does have some pay aspects to it but thats only if youre the speedy type who dont like to wait ill go into detail over this in a second all in all the game is still in beta and it has been in beta for a while so dont expect it to come out of beta anytime soon that being said digtal extremes here on in this review will be known as [de] does interact with the comunity of players new and old from talking to others in the forums and holding weekly twitch livestream events they do it all they even give shout outs to the user submissions as well as join some players sessions i can personally vouch for this when i had a fangasm when [de]s on rebeca joined in on my game during a mission if youre reading this rebeca it was amazing to coop with you  youre probably thinking why has it been in beta for so long well [de]s still working on stuff like performance improvements in networking maps ai etc and overall performance of the game mechanics it self while tossing in new enmies more content and more lore they also hold events in the game for extra nice things too like rare mods for your warframes weapons and sentinel pets coop plenty of coop youll run in a team of four it can be with your friends or random people who can quickly become friends with considering the userbase is full love lively people you know who you are >d what about pvp theres pvp in the game as well though i dont dabble to much into that so i couldnt tell you much about it clan wars yes brand new clan wars get up with a clan and go take on other clans by destroying thier solar rails which are things that allow you to go into other parts of the game for extra things too what about customization heres where ill get personal i like to customize from macho man randy savage zombies in l4d2 to motherhumping thomas the tank as dragons in skyrim it makes it all the better to me now theres no client mods for warframe but you can customize your stuff in the game itself either by paying for currency called platinum which isnt all that expensive and in my opinion wait untill you get a discount from login rewards oh yeah did i mention there were login rewards because there are and the more you log in the better they are anyway the cosmetics in the game can be bought with platinum or be recived through alerts login rewards or events also you can technically earn platinum by trading rare item drops for them oh yeah you can customize your weapons damage effects too nifty eh d those you dont have to pay plat for that i thought this wasnt pay to win you lied to me toyo no i didnt also turn off caps lock its not getting you any brownie points weapons come in two different flavours you can pay for one and get it right then and there with a booster to allow more damage customization or you can buy the blueprints with ingame credits grind for the needed resources and build the item and wait for a bit you wont get that boost like i mentioned before but you can get those via login rewards alerts and npc faction wars jsut gotta grind and build those too when you recive the item the games set up where you dont get a winning advantage just for throwing money at the game the only thing that does is get you cosmetic items and such [though i will admit i have thrown money at the game for some shiney things im not proud of myself but at the same time i look totes cool yo] what about end game stuffs theres one right now and it will be a grindfestwell the entire game is a grindfest if you really think about it and dont mind waiting for your stuff to finish building theyre actively adding more content with weekly updates to the game with various fixes tweaks and new items which for me keeps the game refreshing and not so stale like some other f2p games i know but wont mention all in all its a very fun game to play and as you can see i played the game fairly religiously [drank the koolaid maybe i dunno] so yeah that 750 hours isnt just having the game runing in the background that is actual game time where i physically played this game its free so what do you have to loose besides not be a badass ninja with a badass sword and parkour skills 1010 will keep playing till my hp hits 0 irland maybe in the afterlifehopefullywonder if they got pcs in the afterlife

im going to start by saying if you dont have patience then you wont like this game in other words it will leave your steam library within 5 hours alright after that your here for the review my experience with the game is amazing other than that annoying so called crafting the game is great melee 20 reveloutionized the games melee system giving it a whole new aspect first heavy weapons actually have a purpose other than more damage they have different attacks but still more damage smaller weapons such as the glaive attack faster and deal less damage and is throwable this pretty much wraps up the review one of the best prequels to a game ever not storyline wise but gameplay wise 95 out of 10
recommended
pretty outrageous game but incase it very good to ply ninjas
recommended
an absolutely amazing title that entertains for hours definite recommendation

recommended
i have not had this game for long but so far it is a great game with the weapons and the add sword making it feel like you are a master at using different weapons im really hoping that this game will get a new update where its pvp with you and your team vs the other in a battlefeild with small buildings that cover you and tall buildings for snipers and close quaters for people with shotguns or machine guns they could also make it control point one level free for all and team death match if this is based in the future they could put jet packs in and making the characters have a light up suit and or having a customisable character where u could also change your characters helmet and body amour and guns but over all i give the game a 810
recommended
this game is really fun and should be played by many i may not have many hours playing it but in those hours i have been playing it ive had the most fun in my life
recommended
really nice game
recommended
compared to most people im an f2p mmo fan i bounce between mmo to mmo just looking for something to keep me occupied warframe has done a pretty good job with mixing social building hack and slash shooter and just plain ninja elements together to create something interesting and addicting ive ended up getting 4 friends addicted to this game without much effort and the other 6 friends are still playing on a regular basis the game provides enough satisfaction to keep rabid game hoppers still for some time the graphics are gorgeous and the gameplay is 95% smooth the other 5% fails due to the occasional glitches and like its worth checking out it is free afterall
recommended
awsome game need beefy computer
recommended
beautiful game love it yes i played for a while in the closed beta and i love it even more in the open every warframe is now mine mauhaahahah
recommended
gets kind of repetative
recommended
excellent gameplay and tutorial i would recommend anyone to play this game

recommended

recommended
awesomely good game for free to play awesome active devs lots of fixes and big updates allmost every month beats many nonftp games 100 play it
recommended
okay so warframewhat to say well first off its a fun progressive game more you progress the better you can play with this being said it isnt in the slightest like other games that do the same deal warframes combat and just just overall friendly feel will keep you coming back as many times as ive tried to take a break from it it always managed to pull me back in the community ingame is amazingmost helpful bunch youll ever meet overall its an extremely addictive game and vets might aswell connect your warframe to steam for the free acheivements its definately worth it i debated it for a bit but finally broke down and did so the game lately is going through some awesome changes with a new melee system new damage system and above all the new gui and upgrades to what the games been for awhile events that give you some neat and pretty powerful gear voids can grant you the power of an ancient race of beings through weapons and frames unlike alot of ftp games it isnt p2w everything can be earned in game with time played yes there is a transaction option for people with less time and those who want to overall just support the devs need i say more i possibly cant without writing a would be book try it for yourself its constantly updated with new gooodies go on download it 
recommended
this game is a great blend of melee and fps with fun acrobatics and spells mixed in i recommend spending enough time to create your own warframe after running through the tutorial to get a feel of all the customization available this is one of my favorite games with a great matchmaking system good loading times and cinematics as well as skins and colors available for purchase if you want to personalize your tenno even more
recommended
ive played this game more than any other free to play game the reason is it gets you into the action immediately everything is free aside from weaponwarframe slots and orokin reactors and catalysts and purely cosmetic stuff it looks beautiful great weapon variety great playstyle variety fast paced action and quick loading times decent enough community to help you when you need it there are a few issues you should know about the game is a bit buggy and sometimes will crash doesnt happen very often anyone who is not a hardcore gamer will be turned off by the large amounts of repetitive gameplay and grind the game is a bit on the easy side and whatever isnt easy is usually cheap theres no real balance of difficulty your favorite weapons or warframes might or already have been nerfed to the ground making them almost useless overall i enjoy the game though and recommend it
recommended
this game is awesome ^_^
recommended
i love the unique aspect of a multiplayer campaign with multiple mission types really makes it a fun and unique experience
recommended
ive played a bit just a bit its pretty neat
recommended
i dont know how this is free i cant stop playing it
recommended
this game is a ton of fun and does a very good job in the free 2 play model i level up more than fast enough so i dont feel cynical about being driven toward some clowny xp booster and all the good stuff in the game can be researched and built by you the only thing you have to have real money for is cosmetics and extra hanger slots if you cant bear to sell back old weapons tldr its chinese space ninjas in space flipping out cutting peoples heads off and being awesome
recommended
this game got my pregnant
recommended
best game every play as a ninja and its free
recommended
this is one of the most attractive games that i ever played it is hard to get inside it but once youve passed the firsts steps this game becomes a place for ultimate enjoyment
recommended
various abhumans battle thru the heavens cheap as free shoot many things and collect much stuff in the pursuit of sweet nectarine power your search is potentially endless but enjoyable would suggest participating if you enjoy guns and space
recommended
i have spent unbeknownst to me over 300 hours playing this game and i have nothing but positive things to say despite the fact that many freetoplay games often require you to pay in order to progress this isnt true with warframe as ive learned from the very beginning you could play for hoursuponhours without having to spend a single penny it wasnt until i was nearing 100 hours that i realized how much i enjoyed this game not only that but i also thought that investing in platinum for the game would only help make my alreadypleasant experience even better warframe has evolved alot in the small amount of time that ive played it through player purchases the developers have added new maps new mods a killer melee battling system and outstanding and unique missions and modes that only add to the spontaneity of this game just imagine a game that mixes ninja gaiden with call of duty with vanquish from my own personal experience its worth checking out  especially if youre a college student like myself and are strapped for spending money on the new games coming out everysooften give this game a shot and im sure you will come to find at least a few things that make warframe a fun great and unique experience game on  lenny
recommended
rating  very fun game however you do need to put some time in it and get into the game to get good gear and stuff like that one very big plus of this game is that all gear can be crafter with resouces you gain troughout the game so even if you dont have the money you can still have everything that somone who pays also has with the exeption of a few decorational stuff wich does not affect gameplay
recommended
everything is over priced
recommended
this game has everything you could ever want
recommended
good game been playing for quite some time now and all i can say it doesnt explain much in the start and its too repititive graphics are very good aswell and this is not a pay to win game but you can pay for cosmetics which you can easily earn by selling mods and keys for platinum
recommended
this game offer a new way to be a ninja
recommended
warframe is goodlooking smoothworking and lets you be a futuristic alien space ninja why are you still reading this and not playing the game
recommended

love this game been playin since befor i used steam and was using raptr awesome gameplay easy to use controller support vived lush graphics excellent voices tons of content with new content added regularly and fun coop super fun game to play for free now for gripes though very few the story is very lacking its not really in your face you have to be looking for it but there is one also this game gets seriously repetitive and if your not playing with friends or a team that talks as you play you get bored and last but not least this game is a epic grind if you dont wanna spend money to get other warframes or speed up the process of leveling and crafting this game will eventually make you put it down because of repetitive grinding that being said this game is awesome and i recommend anyone give a shot its free for goodness sake and lets not comment on the epicness of playing this on a big 1080 tv with surround sound and dualshock 4 and steams awesome big picture mode

how i lost my life to warframe to me for the longest time it was one of those games that ill see and hear about early on and decide nah thats not my kind of game i wont bother getting into it anytime it pops up the same thought is there and nothing budges eventually lots of friends were getting into it playing all the time that game has never seemed fun or my kind of game i still wouldnt like it so i wont get into it still even though theyre playing it so much theyre prolly just overhyping it ive always felt it wont be fun to me but then i decided for whatever reason hell ill try it out at least and now im on the other side as friends watch me play constantly and wonder how its even possible its just a plain fun game pretty to look at and play and even its f2p tactics feel good in the long run i was pessimistic about the waiting and grinding involved but pacing your gameplay helps to enjoy things longer without burning out on things right away dont wanna wait 12 hours for a weapon to build just take a bit of control sleep it off wake up to a nice new shiny toy therell be more to do in the meantime the new player experience is just a bit slow to get you off your feet is all

warframe is a good game it may dont have a story or exact campain but hey its an open beta what are you waiting forthis game contains an xp system if you keep using your char excalibur loki ash rhyno etc it will lvl up with each lvl up you can add mods that you can find on missions they are very unique and the mods depends of how you equip them if you are lvl 4 you can add a mod that is lvl 4 lvl 3 or lvl 2 with another lvl 2 the missions are pretty big after an update you can spen from 30 to 1 hours at exploring the big map it worth it because you can find more ammo health and credits killing enemies with a specific weapon it makes it worth even more because if you only kill with your braton mk l your rifle will lvl up and you can add mods to your wep you can use a primary weapon a secondary wich its always a pistol and a melee that you can use if you spam that damn e button after you finish a mission you will recieve extra points you can only recieve this points if you killed a lot of enemies or depending of how much enemies you killed this extra points will not help all your weapons to lvl up it depends of how much you kill with them lvling up your tenno and your weps makes this game very entretaining and long and pleasedont go to a mission where the enemies are lvl 50 and you are lvl 20 with lvl 10  20 wepsthey will kick your  so fastso lvl up everything you can before doing those missions go for them tenno yes i know i didnt review the online stuffbuts who cares just click on the big blue button that says online and choose if you want to do your missions alone with a friend or public forgot to mention this game actually have bosseswitch them are generals or bigass robots they are very hard to kill so if you are a high lvl guy go for them if you are notjoin or make a lobby and let your tenno buddys help you with the damn general or robot
recommended
great game for a free to play lots of cool weapons and warframes classes with awesome abilities
recommended
i recommend this game to everyone
recommended
ive spent so many hours on this game and with update 13theres no word in any language that can express how much i love this game so uh yeah play it worth your time
recommended
i found warframe to be a very fun game one that ive spent a lot of time on however if you plan on getting invested in it without spending a lot of money you will need to invest a lot of time into it i was only able to create a new warframe by the 40 hour mark so keep in mind stuff takes awhile in this you can get the option to just pay for a new warframe but most you can make if you got the patience for it it takes awhile but once you unlock most of the missions youll have access to most of the parts you need to make a warframe however when you start the game you will only have two warframe slots so you can only have two warframes if you want more you have to buy them with platniumreal cash or use the 50 platnium the game will start you off with overall if you want to give this game a try i would recommend it but just know that it takes awhile to get some of the other warframes so be sure you know what your starting warframe is
recommended
its a great game so much detail and missions its just unbelievable its a free game i just played 7 days without anygame and its still adictive like i just started the game
recommended
heaps of fun leans more towards the pay to win but you can play free and still get the same benefits best played with friends
recommended
space ninjas after playing the destiny beta on xbox one and loving the pve coop i was looking for something similar to kill the month and a bit until destiny is released in warframe ive found that and more destiny its not but for a free to play title it has a lot to offer you have a range of parkour type moves that help you rapidly navigate the levels once you learn how to combine them to vault slide flip wall run and more your way around so fast the enemy cant keep up you can take the fight to the enemy at range with your primarysecondary weapons or get up close and personal with your melee weapon gather enough energy from fallen enemiescrates and you can unleash your true space ninja powers to devastate the enemy aid your allies or boost your mobility depending on the warframe youre using the freetoplay model is well done and you could conceivably play the game for hundreds of hours without paying a single dollar i will personally spend some cash on the game just to support the developers but you can get along just fine without doing so its the typical f2p model with cash either saving you time or letting your characters look just that bit funkier the game also offers pvp if thats your thing but its not mine so i havent checked it out yet to comment on it if you are old enough to remember mdk fondly or enjoyed too human then you owe it to yourself to check this out
recommended
wow this is incredible for a beta
recommended
pretty good free to play game
recommended
love the game
recommended
warframe an amazing third person game which would be pretty accurate to say is the epitome of robot ninjas which in turn makes this game extremely fun to play besides the repetition of levels and the occasional glitches this game has everything pretty much down pat from awesome graphics to a solid fighting system which makes this game even better to play and its all for free so i highly recommend adding this game to your library and you will get quite a few hours of entertaining moments out of it
recommended
warframe is not only my favourite game of all time but it is also a game where legends are born my friends let me explain why this game is where patience and dedication is needed because most of the time you will need to gather resources to build the weapons and characters which suit your play style how this game works is that you the player must travel across the galaxy and battle against the three main fractions which are constantly fighting each other and you you the player are known as tenno who are this badass super race which existed in the past generation and have just awaked from a deep sleep from here you fight enemies and gather different resources to build your equipment to use depending on the enemies your are against there is a huge verity of weapons which are never ending because as we speak more weapons are coming out you have three different weapons at your disposal the main weapon your secondary weapon and your melee weapon i can sit here all day and go in great detail but that would take forever lets just say the combat system is so indepth its like sitting a science exam its so indepth the weapons you have are insane were talking cannons laser rifles swords axes scythes gauntlets rocket launchers and even weapons made from the flesh of your enemies im serious there are so many weapons in this game there is something for everyoneeven cowboys but ill be honest here the main thing to make this game shine is timeallot of your time as ive already said you need to gather resources to craft your weapons different planets have different resources so you will have to farm for your equipment so if you thing you can go all badass right at the start your wrong this is not that type of game if you dont spend time gathering resources then this game is not for you if youre not nice to the game the game will  you off and trust me its very easy to get  off with this game as long as you are patient enough you will start to get the ropes of the game and you will be smiling the whole time there are different mission in the game to add some verity like capture mission exterminations and defence so you wont get board anytime soon with just one type of game mode and this game had events that appear from time to time which reward the player which especial and unique rewards for completing the mission for this reason you will be constantly be login to the game to see if anything special comes up you can play with three other people friends or no so you always have someone covering your back but the option is there to play alone but i wouldnt recommend it if your liking this stuff so far then it gets way better you can craft different types of character you can play as which are called warframe thats where the title comes from warframe have special abilities they can use in battle to change things up one warframe controls fire while another controls ice once can controls the minds of their opponents and one can even raise the dead to fight for you the characters are awsome and have so much unique play style you will never bet board through the game you will collect pickups known as mods these mods drastically change the gameplay in warframe they can be used to upgrade your warframe and your weapons upgrades like more damage or more health there are huge amounts of mods in this game so you can customise your warframe and weapons to suit your play style speaking of customisation you can change the colours and appearances of your weapons and characters so you can swag your way thought the universe in style for those who are interested in the setting of the game its defiantly interesting its a scifi universe but there is just something about playing as the warframe who are pretty much gods which gives this game a really different feeling the graphics are top quality and the soundtracks are solid it dosnt end there you can also create a clan for your friends which you can trade and make deals with or even fight against each other to see whos the strongest clans can even make alliances with other clans and best of all clans can claim part of the galaxies by participating in missions knows as dark sectors this is where the higher level players play at completing and conquering the dark sector means your clans symbol will be displayed to all other player to show that your clan is one of the best there is so much more to talk about but for the sake of my hands and your interest ill just stop right here this game is never ending and is constantly being updated and fixed with patches which also give new weapons and characters to play as its endless give this game a try there is something for everyone but as i have already said you must but the time into it one more thing for those idiots saying that this game is pay to win no these are the types of people who dont know how to farm for their equipment anyway im done play warframe
recommended
bcuz i dont have it swag duhhh im downloading it right now noobs suck my bootyhole
recommended
150% better than the time it first appeared d good job guys  play it now and become the ultimate warrior
recommended
love this game
recommended
got stuck in a wall as all of the enemies lost control of their limbs and flailed around 1010 would have a seizure again
recommended
this is like metal gear rising with a bit of slow close combat but replace with badass guns 3
recommended
top notch create graphics fun community and over all a dam good game if you like gears of war or anything similiar id recommend this jam
recommended
started playing this game two days ago and has been running smoothly so far the coop gameplay is really impressive and fun to play theres always the option to get into a mission by yourself and hope that people are going to join you but some missions arent wellbalanced for solo play the graphics of the game is okay and most critically theres no lag or ping display anywhere theres a good variety of guns to choose from including really powerful bows that can pin enemies against the wall i think the swordsman archetype was a little overplayed the melee combat here is also satisfyingly weighty charged attacks that can cut enemies clean in half are their own reward one of warframes significant issues at the moment is its failure to display important information especially in the missionselect interface other than that the game was pretty well made and i will recommend this game to all who are looking for some fun in coop gameplays
recommended
best game ever totally hooked d
recommended
i can not openly recommend this game to anyone not with the problems the game still has some of the worst connectivity issues i have seen in an online game terrible physics issues and even worse terrible ui issues if i were to give this game a rating as it is now i would give it a 3510 but it has a potential for a lot more so despite hating all the problems i am going to look where this thing goes most importantly if you are reading this you are doing it wrong dont read recommendations or meta scores on f2p games make the decision yourself
recommended
one of my favorite coop games on steam having a friend to go into this with you is a must great game especially for the fact that it is free 55 must play free game
recommended
very fun
recommended
for those who love the fps or even a group mission to look for the best looking gear in todays fasion this is it an fps in 3rd person and the outfits are so colorful functional too
recommended
fun game probably one of the best freetoplays out there almost everything is obtainable through progression
recommended
warfame is an awsome game i love itits a very good gamemy preference is first person shooters but this game is a great exception this game maes it not even matter it is so awsomesadly for me i do not like how u have to pay for more charecters or craft them which takes forever but besides thatfact the charecters are well balenced and it is a great game
recommended
suggest you play this game if you like violence shooting 3rd person and scifi d really good and free to play unless you want to buy platnium
recommended
the game is so fast and i like that in a game 
recommended
pros good graphics fun gameplay lots of weapons to choose from cons expensive items in market expensive ingame currency but it a fun game you know but im not sure why platinum is expensive its still in open beta would be better if there was credit to platinum exchange or be able to buy everything in the market with credits i only reccomend this game for people who have lots of cash to spend on to support the devs or for people who want to experience a fun coop sci fi action game with friends or other people
recommended
ive had so much fun in this game it is simply amazing and impressive an interesting concept with nice asthetics across the board to boot and fun gameplay its main drawback is an endgame of a massive grindfest depending on where you want to go but even so you can still have fun with what you have in all it was a fun experience to be part of and still is today
recommended
quite fun to play online and alone only thing that felt bad was limited inventory slots that you have to buy with real money
recommended
fastpaced pve scifi with an incredible art direction and its free and its fun
recommended
got a ton of hours lol and dota2 just not filling your daily grind and like to jump around being tech ninja then warframe is chances are for you a game still rising up from a beta status its pretty damn repetative for sure but it at least offers you some goals to reach out towards better gear upgrading gear upgrading cards to enhance gear and the long grind to get just one more warframe suit to use it will take you hours inclduing after the recent updates to see progress but in a f2p enviroment thats kinda given isnt on that note for the most part it is pay to go faster as  anything outside of colors and extra slots  can be earned without spending a cent onto the gameif you are pacent enough anyway
recommended
this game is fun and comes out with lots of new content it is simply awesome
recommended
totally awesome but ive been playing a while now and its crying out for a new race
recommended
this game is too good to be free to play become the space ninja you always wanted to be slice your enemies and use your powers and abilities to eliminate your foes in the snap of your fingers grab a couple of friends and save the system good game
recommended
the new standard in which all freetoplay games should strive for digital extremes has raised the bar once again since they first created unreal tournament warframe is simply pure bliss to play
recommended
well this game is kinda out of my expection not just a simple shooting and cuting gamethis game has a very unique weapon and mods system and you can also craft your own weapon and gear that means you dont need to waste your money in the online shop unless you love showing off although it is almost impossible for low level players to solo most of the maps it is a online gamesowhy not make a team with other people  ps the main reason why i love this game is because hint metal gear 
recommended
warframe is one of the best multiplayer games out there which is worth playing it the game is simple you play a role as a tenno and fight enemies in outer space when i started playing the game for the first time i found it a bit hard to understand the interface especially on how to mod your warframe & weapons how to use the foundry to build tools how to obtain resourcesplayed before update 11 was out because it somehow lacks the tutorial for suchi guess its one of the cons excalibur was my first warframeactually it was loki but then i made a new account to link with steam and chose exca instead after a few rounds i found it being addictive especially when playing with friends or random strangers online the graphic is good and lovely the dev really put aan effort to make the game more realistic despite making it fun and enjoyable to play it kinda has this mass effect feel to it due to the space environment and being a 3rd person the beautiful environment really brings up my mood to play the game more getting credits to buy stuff in the game can be hard since the items in the market require a lot of credits plus most of the items sold require platinums which you cant never get ingame and have to use real money and purchase it online but that doesnt stop you from obtaining cool items like premium users instead of buying directly you can buy the blueprints of the desired weapon from the market and build it in the foundry but you have to spent quite a lot of credits on the blueprint excluding the materials you need to build the item and of course building cost and a long waiting time some items like warframe can take up to 3 days to be built in the foundry and require rare materials such as orokin cell neural sensors etc which is time  consuming so if you cant buy the weapons straight away you can use the alternate way but itll cost you i dont think this game has any storyline but somehow it can be related to dark sectorprevious game made by the same dev so i cant say much about this because you dont have any clear goals other than fighting enemies bosses and farming materials but this game is always updated by the dev so there are surprises comingnew mission warframe weapon boss etc so keep yourself updated so far i really enjoyed playing it got new warframes and weapons in my inventory and unlocked a few systems overall i would say its a pretty decent game and i suggest that gamers out there should try this game play solo or with friends or with random users it can never seize to amaze you so tenno get framed up and fight cause ninjas play free
recommended
in all honesty and entirely an opinion this is a very well made game having patches pretty much every week or so de manages to pull off some amazing things with this game now onto the game itself its a scifi third person shooter this is one of those rare f2p games which can be enjoyed with friendsrandom people or just going in solo the gameplay is pretty much what you would expect from a tps but you have a lot of movement and actions to pull off in this game making you have that ninja feel if youre a person who does not mind farming for items or rather just enjoy that this game has plenty of that but after all that and finishing up your warframe or weapon youll have the satisfaction of just playing with a new toy you made you have a wide variety of warframes consisting of different powers to pretty much choose from and see what interests you the best weapons are always being put into the game to make things more interesting from kunaisdual swordsscythes rockets etc the lore is another eye candy for those who love to read into games to learn their story now onto the topic of paying real money you really dont need to give money to play this game this game in no way is a p2w i would say 7080% of the items in the shop can be bought with ingame money or alertsmissions in which will give you special drops from time to time but if you are to pay money its only for cosmetics or space in your inventory which in all honesty is not that bad since you can delete weapons which you dont feel you like anymore and move on
recommended
made by the same crew who did dark sector feels and looks very polished even though its in beta very fun im looking forward to the new content the devs come up with
recommended
probably my favorite free game our there right now others include path of exile ghost recon online league of legends and loadout this is a great example of how the business model in a f2p game should be any item that you can buy for real money you can easily get for free anything that you cant get for free is purely cosmetic graphics are great for a free game and crafting a new gun or warfame just never seems to get boring it is kind of a grindfest though and after spending almost 200 hours into this im starting to get burnt out its still in beta and ive heard that the devs are gonna start to change things a bit make it more interesting as it stands now its a must play its free so theres nothing to lose 
recommended
ever played mass effect 3 multiplayer this is very similar except it most of the game modes are more akin to dungeon runs than static defense that being said shooty stabby space ninja super funtime is quite entertaining very fast paced gameplay
recommended
its fun to pass the time and having patience will get you anything in the game
recommended
this game really has gotten my attention it probably has all i could ask for it has tons of action an rpg mechanic which makes you want to farm those mods to become more poweful play with friends levelup gain new weapons and warframes and rank the  up 
recommended
game type mmo  third person  free2play but in a good way  shooter  hack and slash  rpg this one is very different from most pay2plays out there you can reliably get almost anything ingame that you could want i am sure there are one or two things only available to people who have paid money into the game but any weapon or warframe worth having can drop during the game all without endlessly farming for the same materials you can end up with great weapons skills and warframes the games answer to a suit of mech armor i guess just by playing the game regularly no extra obnoxious farming although you will probably be farming for hours anyways levelling up your everything is key to having the most powerful weapons and skills skills oh my god if i could describe how the skills can vary from person to person warframe to warframe weapon to weapon it would take me a degree in math and i would still have to write an entire article in order to describe it a tutorial would take an entire wiki you level up your account on a fairly regular basis but can only take the test to level up once every 24hrs this however doesnt impede your ability to progress and make gains on your characterframeweapon combination as each fight may drastically alter the way that you choose to play your game permanently or perhaps just for certain missions anyways its been said before but never by me the possibilities are nearly endless they are legitimately endless if development continues on the game and the growth is exponential with each update no need to worry about micspamming kids in this game the voicechat is nearly unusable and encourages the use of teamspeak my advice get a group together either irl friends or use the lobby to quickly put together a squad of unstoppable ninja and get into this game its the only way youll understand and remember when playing  the wiki is written by people with experience and will save you hours of potentially wasted time good luck and honestly try it out you will probably like it
recommended
space ninjas you cant beat it
recommended
its a very fun game its repetitive at times but theres a very steady stream of new content and it always adds variety the visuals are sleek and the combat feels really cool its definitely worth playing for that coolfactor alone its also a very enjoyable multiplayer experience with friends
recommended
this game is very promising a beginners guide would help after the initial training session i was taken to a big overview mapmenu with basically no information on how to navigate itwhat to do
recommended
one of the best free to play game ive ever seen bit boring when things get repetitive but when you do missions with a team its good fun amazing graphics stunning animations and skillset effects plus you cant go wrong its free
recommended
sick game p
recommended
more fun than a fat girl and a tub of crisco i recommend that anyone who loves fpss and mmos give this a try
recommended
warframe review level space comrade ninja bunnies one of the most interesting projects of 2013 that flowed into 2014 that ive seen the game has all what a gamer needs guns fancy karate gimmicks swords two words space ninjas what is actually good that the game even tho is f2p but it does not follow a shadowy p2w path you might be confused in the beggining as getting the stuff crafting locations and controls but when you get over it you might as well like it another aspect that drives the attention constant new content updates from very friendly developers i might add that devs do take in considiration players ideas and implement ideas and throughts into a real thing almost all the stuff ingame can be aqquired just by playing the game you just need to get over the beggining but this game is still in beta there could be bugs there could be flaws currently devs implement tons of content every two months aprox in general this is a game that you might totally like or just play for two minutes and uninstall playing with friends is recomended
recommended
do you recommend this game of course i will because its damn good and fast action game its about team work and you would not miss it because it is not like other games like pay to win here everything depends on your skills and reaction about your accuracy and moving style so go on and download it you wont be disapointed
recommended
with no doubt one of the best f2p games first of all it is actually free meaning everything in the game is obtainable without spending a single penny thanks to the ingame trading system that speaks to des generosity fantastic customization options for both weapons and frames stunning visuals addictive gameplay and a lot more have made me to spend more than 600 hours of my time into this game recommend it to any and every gamer
recommended
awesome games good graphics good gameplay and many more love this games 
recommended
fun and exciting game thats like all i have to say
recommended
the pinacle of mmo adapted to fps third person adds to the overall experiance custimization is to die for graphics are next gen i would advise this game to anyone and find a single person who didnt enjoy
recommended
good game for cooperative players fun misions overall 710
recommended
good game for free to play with fun and interesting combat and teamplay but it has several severe flaws which are that it has a bad payment model things are overpriced and you are required to buy more slots for warframes and weapons i u want more then two secondly the game becomes very repeatitive and there is not very much metagame the last thing is that it is very difficult to get interested in this game starting off due to its repeativeness
recommended
warframe has a few quirks here and there but you should not just give this a glance invest at least a good hour and youll form a new passion to the freetoplay lifestyle 8510
recommended
this game is an example of free to play done mostly right which is very rare you a member of the tenno race are equiped with suits known as warframes each with unique stats and powers it is your mission to aid in the war between the tenno grineer corpus and infested admitadly the game plays like a standard third person shooter where it really shines is all of the different weapons and mods just waiting to be discovered like bows to assault rifles health increases to abilities its not without its problems though the game is littered with microtransactions and while optional grinding isnt fun unless you have friends oh yeah this game has a standard 4 player coop system too which it is usually designed around overall i would suggest getting this game with a very open mindset
recommended
despite my username and avatar i dont go in much for fpss i still love this game its a lot like mass effect multiplayer with the addition of martial arts flick acrobatics good balance so far in the freemium aspects  new equipment comes along fast enough particularly when playing with friends that i dont feel screwed by not paying money for it looking forward to how this game develops over time
recommended
good coop 3rd person shooter graphic is good enough for a free to play game games mechanic is a bit hard to learn but youll get the hang of it soon enough the action during missions is often fast paced and some of them are a real challenge i would eecommend this game to those who like dead space mixed with some mmorpg mechanics farming loot craft better equip etc not recommended for those who dislike farming and crafting
recommended
very fun and entertaining
recommended
warframe is a pretty enjoyable coop game as you level you get to understand that this is one of those games in wich leaving a team mate behind is not a choice because solo is not a option at least on low levels it lacks pvp maps like lets say halo combat evolved had in wich 5 or more players on 2 different teams fight to accomplish one common objective may it be killing each other or capturing a certain objective capture the flag for example would be a pretty cool game mode in warframe since players have high mobility with the shift  jump  ctrl combo you can make your own warframes and weapons wich is kinda well though its still in open beta but i hope when it goes live it turns into a better experience ill give it 7 out of 10 points
recommended
better then firefall game imo a lot of stuff to do
recommended
this game is good
recommended
ya its pretty cool but way to heavy on the pay to win area that part is mega fail
recommended
a very enjoyable game to play the combat style is very much like mass effect 3 from a 3rd person point of view if youre looking for a battlefield 4 level of graphics look elsewhere but if you like games such as the diablo line of gamesthe constant runs through certain levels to try and obtain specific items and dead spacemass effect 3 then this game in my opinion merges all of that beautifully and even with at least some kind of a story i would like to eventually see more than just 4 players in some of the game modes though like the survival modes this game also offers an offline play mode and just having that makes this a great game for me because i am currently working on an offshore oil rig with limited wifi capability
recommended
so far the best 3rdperson freeonlinegame out there
recommended
warframe is an innovative and addictive game with a really cool ninjas with gunsvibe i have great hopes for this game and cant wait for it to leave beta quite honestly for a beta game it is very stable as for the few hiccups that do occur they are resolved reletivly quickly by the developers infact alot quicker that most large reputable gaming developers massive thumbs up from this guy
recommended
first experience with warframe might be bad at least it was bad in my case game graphics are ugly and tutorial is quite boring after that there is also strange interface with solar system but since you start playing missions on mercury solo  with silend assassin style  or multi impossible to sneak with random people there is great chance that your perspective might change warframe is fast paced third person shooterslasher in type of dungeon crawler mixed with teamplay known from left 4 dead you pick your starter warframeclass but you are able to craft any other class withought using real money  its nice epsecially for free to play game each warframe has its unic abilities and you can boost them with mods found on fallen enemies or bough from other players the game has great community and devs which is great advantage what might hurt game still has bugs nothing serious but after while it might be annoying when you need to start all over again for the third time because mob disappeared in textures and you cant finish your run and also if you are impatient crafting system will make you suffer because its not about farming materials well it is but its not that hard but time that takes real hours or even days last stage of warframe craft takes over 3 days to craft  no worried there is plenty of thing to do so you wont be sitting and waiting for your weaponwarframe to be ready game mods are fun there is also waframe customization and even that there is some similarity to every run the game can keep you focused for a long hours before you deciede to reach for another game so if you want to feel like killing machine warframe is definitely worth playing
recommended
my favorite game so far great for team work
recommended
this game is fun and a bit of excitement when they start swarming youcoop play fun too cool graphics and smartenough ai just love to keep repeating missions to get special boss drops and level up my gear

veteran warframe player here this game is very fun to play with friends however becomes dull very quickly if youre playing alone the game itself has great graphics and controls however the gameplay grows dull as the maps are generated using a tile system and youll see yourself fighting the same enemies however this is made up by the vast amount of weapons in the game as well as the damage rework that the staff did the staff really listen to the community and try to respond to the best of their ability i would say that warframe has one of the best staff for not only listening and responding to the community but also doing livestreams and giving away platinum platinum is warframes ingame currency that can only be bought with real world currency as expected from a f2p game however there are little to no paywalls in this game for me i didnt have to spend any money on this game however the only aspect that i would count a paywall is the limitation on slots for weapons and warframes the suits you are given free platinum when creating an account which can be spent on buying slots for more weapons and warframes however once you start spending more time and creating more items youll see yourself running out of space this game however is a f2p game and getting hundreds of hours out of it is worth spending money on in all however you start to see yourself just grind for weapons materials and levels through the same tiles over an over again so the game becomes very dull and boring which is why i recommend playing this game with friends as well as to treat this game as something you would just play casually

great game though i know of a few people who would really enjoy it better with a controller i can manage with a keyboard 5 button mouse also helps but try it for yourself it is free after all almost everything is obtainable by playing the only thing thats not is colors for warframe and weapons and sometimes they give you free ones warframe slots and weapon slots these can be purchased with platinum the premium resource you get 2 warframe slots and i think 5 or 6 weapon slots you get random daily rewards which include coupons for platinum up to 75% off so if you wait you can get a decent amount of platinum for a few dollars my only complaints would be 1 that you need certain mods to continue these are upgrades for your weapons and warframes that can buff just about everything you really need a damage mod to continue past venus and most should be able to get this by playing survival or defense missions which give you a good variety 2 they make you choose a warframe before you know what you want so heres what i recommend if you like being stealthy and are good at avoiding damage pick loki if you want a balanced and tough warframe pick excalibur if you like being a caster and are good at avoiding damage pick mag for more detailed information on the warframes and everything else for that matter search for warframe wiki the link is warframewikiacom some games that might be a good measurement of your skills for comparison are devil may cry series but especially 1 and 2 and gears of war series especially the ones with horde the game isnt that hard to start with but it does get harder later

really fun once you learn the basics may seem very confusingat first but otherwise its great there are also a couple of bugs and the game crashes sometimes but that is fixed in the regular updates
recommended
this is one of the best f2p games ive ever played its a very unique game and everyone should experience that the game looks pretty fine and there is no pay to win and also the game is not that easy so grab urself some buddies to play with the one thing that i didnt get is the stealth mechanics but after all  its a mother flipping action shooter
recommended
if you like mass effect you should try this out

simply and stunningly amazingi recommend it to all who play games

a fun coop fps with leveling elements in addition to your characters your account weapons and minions gain levels as you progress with higher levels you can apply modules to your items increasing various attributes in them modules themselves are drops and the module collecting and building your gear mechanics feel like deck building in a collectible card game the game is peerhosted which probably helps keep the game free to play but also means that you will sometimes end up playing on a server that is hosted on a connection that cant handle the bandwidth requirements of four players this can be somewhat resolved with pingfiltering peers especially if you have the connection and cpu power to host yourself almost everything in the game can be obtained without paying real money except characterweapon slots but as usual time is money and helps you progress faster

i downloaded it initialy becouse it was a free game on steam it sat there after my first few mision for a couple months i practicly ignored it at first but then i relize people in my guild wars clan were enthralled by it since then ive played it for about a week and it brought me closer to people in my guild i sooner hadent even known funny how stuff like that can work to really love and understand this game you need to know a few things the current priceing for a few packs like excaliber prime is a project to give people limited time weapons to further increase production of the game as awhole this game is currently in open beta and as such has some bugs most of wich are negligable the currency system gives players the ability to buy everything no grind required get your warframe your guns and off you go to be some kinda crazy space ninja the most importent part of the game however is that if you purchase the high end 200$ bundle your ideas can truely play an ear and major roll in development some can say thats a bad thing but howmeany opertunitys to you find now a day to actualy controle the content in your persistent world in closeing the game is majorly focused on coop not pvp in fact the devs words pvp will go as far as friendly sparing nothing more i think thats as far as i can stress how awsome this game is and can potentialy be its free you have nothing to lose
recommended
amazing game repetitive but addiciting and fun once youve started getting far in the game u are bassicly forced to spend real currency to advance if money isnt to much of a problem its an amazing game
recommended
space ninjas with super powers also free to play what more do you need

warframe is essentially a grindfest with fantastic gameplay and visuals it borrows heavily from diablostyle loot drops although none of this is explained ingame i recommend using a wiki if you fall in love with this game as it has a suprisingly deep character customization set though dont expect to get much visual upgrades as most of the mods that drop function essentially like a mmotalent tree lots of fun but bring friends if you plan on sticking around
recommended
this game is too damn good my god if you are a f2p player you can get plat by doing void missions and selling prime parts for plat this way makes it possible for free players to earn in game money im a f2p player and have earned over 200 plat so far just by selling prime parts love this game
recommended
warframe is literally the best ftp game out there and it even beats out most paid games ive played warframe does free to play the right way everything you need to play is avaliable by ingame credits or leveling up the only things you absolutely have to buy are purely cosmetic all in all youre a space ninja killing space monsters in space ships with space guns and space swords oh and now you can fly in space space ing ninjas man just its free and space ninjas literally the one reason i dont have a life

started playing this game in closed beta and back then this game was so much less than it it now now they add new content every week make tons of events kinda frequently to keep me in the game i sometimes just log on to get that alertmission reward or to quickly level up some of my gear and i always have a fun time doing so so for me this game is one that i jump in and out from one week i play all day every day other weeks i log on to complete alerts i like the fluidity of the movement and how it makes me wanna improve it with every new movement tweak the weapons are kind of standard if you look at them raw but with mods in this game it opens a whole new world of damaging your opponents and they recently did a rework of the whole damage system for update 110 and they addad a whole bunch of new interesting combinations to learn and use along with update 110 they also added a codex to the game before this i and alot of other player relied on the warframewikia page where we found all the information for pretty much everything the codex puts all of this ingame so no more false wikia information overall a really good and fun game and its expanding more and more every week also a really interesting game to follow as its developed further would play  me
recommended
ive read some of the reviews and im surprised no one has said this in honest truth deep down its a grind fest you go to 1 planet you get the materials you need and you keep doing it until you have enough over and over again and to top that that off it takes maybe like 20 hours to get a new warframe if your at least trying ive been playing this game before it was realeased on steam and i finally downloaded it on steam anyways you finally craft a new warframe but wait you have to wait another 75 hours for it to be done and you get more materials and you grind again until you get a new warframe and its the same process over and over and over again and then it just gets repetitive also not to mention the cost of platinum its either xp locked witch is ok or its 200 platinum whitch evens out to be about $5 for $5 i could get a decent game but of course devs got to make money too but 200 platinum only gets you like 1 wep  dont get me wrong this is a good looking game and can run on pretty much anything but people are hiding the fact that it truly is a grind
recommended
i like this game it got ragdoll physics nice graphics awesome moves and other cool stuff i recommend this to players who like third person shooters and scifi games

i get lost in how much time i spend on this game if you are interested in joining my clan drop me a message

graphics  spectacular effects  nice animations  varied areas  additional physx effects sound  rapid music  great weapon sounds  great sound effects  language only english balance  warframes and weapons very different  variant warframes work good in team  many missions can be played solo atmosphere  outlandish dark scenario  very fast gameplay feel like a ninja  own spaceship as base  weak storyline control  easy shooter control  good tutorial  basic skills are easy to learn  warframe and weapon function will barely explained game size  many planets and moons  many warframes  big assortmant of weapons and equipment  different mission types  pvp mode  long farming for new equipment  few enemy factions level design  every area has a own flair  outdoor levels  random obstacles  some maps to big walk to much  areas repeat a lot combat system  fast shooter combat system  enemys hide and attack from flanks  acrobatic moves  fights sometimes to hectic weapons and extras  crazy weapon systems  every warframe has unique specials  many upgrades  combat dog companion  pistoles little bit weak  only a few weapons has a secondary shoot mode character creation you have a choice between 3 warframes ninja suit like robot killing machines aka you each warframe is unique in look and abilities excalibur has a slash dash ability and stun ability the others use stealth and or mob manipulation this is something i enjoy about the game as well you are not into a role or other limitations most shooter have you can still build weapon from sniper to assault rifles once you have a character chosen you can modify its colors on several layers of the warframe suit f2p are locked in basic color scheme but there is enough there to get creative my sword used a nice red and white to start you will be happy with what you have but you will run across some great looking warframes and that alone makes me want to put some money into customize the size of costomize is very good for a fps game most games give you uniforms or character choices warframe has logical purchases and very nice looks you can also change colors anytime in the game graphics the animations create that dark space feel it is not just corridors and tubes there are open areas small areas and hangers in warframe it is unique as well the creators really developped a mark of its own the graphical setting are really unique and make you feel immersed in their world you are sneaking in every mission it also adds that you are alien and you are here in a wrong place they could use just a little more interaction more living elements to the game some spot feel abandoned or to cold but all in all it makes a great battlefield and perfect game setting game play you start in a planetary system and move along as a space ninja you sneak in at the start of each round and are given orders for your mission via com link each time you complete a mission the next path opens up the missions include assassinating a target sabatoging the systems rescuing a prisoner etc one of my favorite things about warframe is the map change you can restart the map and it is a new map with new layout same mission this randomization of maps is very nice the ui is great i could be assault that shoots and scoots i could be mele and slash my way through the ui is logical and makes use of your warframe it is a compliment you and battle systems and the other players warframe builds compliment each other that is the one word to summarize this game play complimentary a great shooter the map progression is nice with a few places to stop and farm a few bosses to stop and kill a few events you will be traveling the universe and looking for places the leveling system unlocks new potentials and weapons for you the game is based around crafting you can purchase to advance in the game but over all it is f2p and requires you play and collect parts to craft the items once the game takes you you will be out to collect as many pieces to build as many warframes there are several other warframes than the starter frames to play them you have to collect the blueprints and then get the materials to craft each piece this is true for weapons as well grouping is fun not just another body to zerg content some players can be jerks and just run and rush to the end and not care about the team all in all this is a great shooter that supports any kind of fps role assault pistoler bow and arrow sniper sword etc i have not reached the end game but my only worry is the rate of enhancements vs content if it requires all my cards are maxed and i cannot max them until i farm parts in the lower areas but it seems everything is fine for the moment the game seems to progress of the f2p and keeps you end gamers busy in crafting every frame and weapon available and testing it and tryoing out combos sound wonderfull the sound of the material of your suit sliding across the floor the little clink of metal as you roll and your sword smacks the ground the sounds of bullet casings dropping after firing the sound of ambient voices and machinery economy and crafting standard upgrades come in drops and rewards they are like cards you put this card into a slot on your gun it has 4 rank slots to increase the ranks you modify the card by fusing it with other cards you can purchase base weapons with in game currency as well but they are the base the better weapons have to be built or purchased with cash the enhancing of abilities starts to get difficult after 4 to 5 upgrades i did not notice an auction house but there is a trade channel the currency seems balanced at the moment and the deals fare you buy out right the parts in real cash or build it yourself combos you add to your weapons cold  poison gas  poison shock there are so many kinds of damage and effects to test and build and try out on weapons some deal bonus damage to mutants others on robots you can build in laser armor bonus to get resistant against laser fire this helps with more laser dealing enemysor extra ammo builds for survival missions overall i like this game rewarding interesting beautiful and a great space theme it is not perfect has some unfair drops rates social aspect could be better i would like to see more living elements in the maps they already are doing a sort of base building and pvp structure sorry for my bad english this is my review account because the low playtime thanks for reading if you like my review give me a thumbs up in steam your help is greatly appreciated

warframe is the most badass game ever invented by mankind it features cybernetic robot ninjas with epic weapons in warframe you are a rare species called the tenno who have been in cryosleep for a long period of time and during this time new factions have been built and are fighting conquests all over the galaxy as a teeno you must go through each planet node and do each objective to weaken the enemy factions the combo system is amazing and it only gets better once you find the warframe that suits you the most the graphics will most likely give you epilepsy and you wont be able to see due to the lights and motion blur distorting your vision the freetoplay model used in this game gives no player advantage however this does not really matter due to the lacking pvp in the game itself overall warframe is a good game however you may experience alot of grinding and replaying mission 710

warframe is a cooperative third person shooter which involves a strange blend of melee combat shooting and parkour there now that weve gotten the standards out of the way warframe is a good game good meaning that it has its pros and its cons when it comes to pros the graphics quality is amazing for a freetoplay game everything stays moderately difficult and even harder if you play like youre supposed to you know 2 or 3 friends all starting at the same time and the parkour system is very smooth and easy to use even for new tps players since the last time i reviewed this game it has changed greatly whereas before i was too scared to make a new weapon due to credit and resource restrictions ive found that resources are much more common in most cases so ive been free to experiment with guns and find the ones i like latron i love ya baby now i have a set of cleavers two hammers a machine gun rifle shotgun several swords and the list goes on the best part about this though is that since credits are more easily achievable now ive been able to experiment without fear of losing much also the way you earn warframes has also changed much whereas before there was a chance that it may or may not spawn once every 5th moon after youve sacrificed your firstborn now youre guaranteed to get a frame part after fighting the boss that drops them so ive actually coughed up some plat and now have six warframes all of which provide an incredible spin on gameplay forcing you to change your playstyle for each frame of course ive got a favorite nyx i love ya baby but each frame is a refreshing take on the game that renews it completely to continue the levels are now actually changed the levels change style depending on whos in control of the planet of course if you play the same planet alot then you may begin to notice that the levels are the same but that can be expected of any game however it can still be a tad grindy at times and several of my friends found the beginning of the game too hard a hurdle for them and quit early on due to the upper levels carrying them through the low levels and making the game boring for them so if youre going to enjoy this game its a necessity that you dont play public matchmaking players tend to rush through the levels and not allow the lowers to really enjoy the game or even get a kill for that matter if youre going to play you either need to play by yourself or with friends i recommend this game provided youve got some friends to play this with zombie chicken

warframe is a great game you can pick up and put down as you have time to play it it requires a lot of grinding type play but the rewards are easily achievable you are not required to purchase platinum but it is useful if you have a few dollars to spend the community is friendly and are usually happy to help new players get into the game

for a free to play multiplayer game warframe does an excellent job of avoiding the pitfalls of most of the freetoplay genre you can navigate and play the game to your hearts content without having to buy anything at all with real money and if you want even earn the in game monetary currency just by playing the game and trading your loot and this is before we even get to the great gameplay with all sorts of various frames you can build and play as highly recommend anyone i know at least give this game a shot use a referral code like this one httpswarframecomsignupreferrerid5168ef4c1a4d800214000026 and you start off with some stuff to get you through the early game a bit faster probably the only part id say was slow moving at all the rest is fast paced ninja running shooting action

a quality f2p game graphics are great the servers are wellpopulated and mostly wellmaintained and its a ton of funif youre into grinding for resources you dont have to spend money but if you want more weaponitem slots in your inventory you may want to buy some platinum ingame currency the community is very friendly as well never had a negative experience with another player solid 75810

this game has been one of my favourites since i had joined its closed beta i love this game to death simply because of the many things that make it something  something which brings the sense of awe back to me when i first played a 4mandungeon hackslash game for the first time except this time it was a 4manthirdpersonshooterintergalacticslaughterfestofsupposedlysuperiorfactionswhichweknowbowdowntousontheirkneesbyspaceingninjas the game mechanics are simple but it is difficult to master a weaponwarframe the fine tweaking and use of modifications and augmentations allow freedom in creating a weaponwarframe that is limitless in power basic gameplay mechanics such as freerunningparkour and shooting whilist doing so are also things which are easy to perform but hard to do with ease unless practice comes into play the interactive community and the fruitful response from the developers of the games it is definitely pleasurable to see the developers interacting with its community through devstreams and events even threads in the forums as anyone reads this  review the devs are working on reworking some bosses whilist adding new content into the game the community you meet ingame is quite interactive and very helpful in regards to educating new players in regards to tips and assistance in getting better at the game indeed some would label this game as paytowin and i can understand that suchslander to be used in this game but to be good at this game it depends on how you build your warframe and their weapons not what you buy with the ingame currency that you cash your real life money into

well your a person in a suits called warframes each warframe has its own set of abilities i go with loki it can go invisible to get past security and can switch places with the enemy so the enemy is confused as you could probally tell from the warframe picture it has guns and what every person needs to spill blood a sword which can be upgraded and you can get different melee weps mostly swords but there are power gloves that can be purchased which allow you to pack a punchget it gloves and punching huh huh anybody any way download it its free

good game for free to play with fun and interesting combat and teamplay but it has several severe flaws which are that it has a bad payment model things are overpriced and you are required to buy more slots for warframes and weapons i u want more then two secondly the game becomes very repeatitive and there is not very much metagame the last thing is that it is very difficult to get interested in this game starting off due to its repeativeness
recommended
warframe has a few quirks here and there but you should not just give this a glance invest at least a good hour and youll form a new passion to the freetoplay lifestyle 8510
recommended
this game is an example of free to play done mostly right which is very rare you a member of the tenno race are equiped with suits known as warframes each with unique stats and powers it is your mission to aid in the war between the tenno grineer corpus and infested admitadly the game plays like a standard third person shooter where it really shines is all of the different weapons and mods just waiting to be discovered like bows to assault rifles health increases to abilities its not without its problems though the game is littered with microtransactions and while optional grinding isnt fun unless you have friends oh yeah this game has a standard 4 player coop system too which it is usually designed around overall i would suggest getting this game with a very open mindset
recommended
despite my username and avatar i dont go in much for fpss i still love this game its a lot like mass effect multiplayer with the addition of martial arts flick acrobatics good balance so far in the freemium aspects  new equipment comes along fast enough particularly when playing with friends that i dont feel screwed by not paying money for it looking forward to how this game develops over time
recommended
the game is very fun and runs good on most computers in all i really enjoyed the game and you should too the bugs you may find are never to serious and yet some of them are funnt
recommended
best game ever totally hooked d
recommended
i can not openly recommend this game to anyone not with the problems the game still has some of the worst connectivity issues i have seen in an online game terrible physics issues and even worse terrible ui issues if i were to give this game a rating as it is now i would give it a 3510 but it has a potential for a lot more so despite hating all the problems i am going to look where this thing goes most importantly if you are reading this you are doing it wrong dont read recommendations or meta scores on f2p games make the decision yourself
recommended
one of my favorite coop games on steam having a friend to go into this with you is a must great game especially for the fact that it is free 55 must play free game

it is amazing it may not seem like it at first but if you get a friend or two it becomes the best coop game ive ever played

there is a bit of a learning curve with warframe but just push through the first 10 hours or so and youll find an incredibly addicting experience if you like 3rd person shooters and the scifi genre or just blowing things up i highly recommend you give it a look

its ok after the first 1600 hours of grinding through you start to wonder if other games should be played instead not to say warframe is a bad game but i spent probably 500$ total on the game and played the same levels 1000 times over its essentially the coolest character customization and power based game ive ever played with a very high skill cap and timed waiting build times for everything some reach up to 3 days to get to late game content unless you have some money with the downfall of having sub par repeating tileset based levels the idea of it is ok and will not become repetitive until about 100 hours in max but overall this is what you can expect from warframe pros amazing easy to do indepth character customization large amount of weapons large variety of weapons seriously theres a freeze gun in this solid upgradeleveling system fun and epic character abilities easy to play with friends active community forums devs will read posts in forums to help improve the game detailed and informative wiki page updates from devs via stream everything non asthetic is available to get with ingame currency cons long wait times for items eg guns warframes keys blueprints to build with the exception of real money to rush it repetitive levels youll play the same level you did on the first planet as you will on the last planet with the exception of higher level enemies not pay to win but if you want to look cool in anyway youre going to be paying for platnium paid currency very grindy seriously if you dont like grind games look somewhere else poor pvp balancing and gameplay overall its worth downloading and checking out i have been playing since patch 20 almost 3 years ago and i think this game has the potential to be aaa status if they remake the map and planet system

warframe is a great way of playing some f2p 3rd person shooter action warframe is still in beta and it seems that the devs are happy to take on board advice from the fans so hopefully a few of the details that could use polish still have a chance to be completed with the price of entry a flat nothing it would be a shame to miss out on quite a bit of fun to be had here

space robot magic ninja warriors fight potato people evil robots and zombie plants and its amazing as  you should totally buy it except its free you can buy wepons for irl  but its pve so  off also game is grindbased but i mean you kill  and its awesome so its not bad grind ok so if you buy  you want then why are you even playing
recommended
brilliant great design and a must for anyone also free 
recommended
good coop 3rd person shooter graphic is good enough for a free to play game games mechanic is a bit hard to learn but youll get the hang of it soon enough the action during missions is often fast paced and some of them are a real challenge i would eecommend this game to those who like dead space mixed with some mmorpg mechanics farming loot craft better equip etc not recommended for those who dislike farming and crafting
recommended
very fun and entertaining

wanna be a badass futuristic shooter ninja runing on walls sliding on the floor with a mix of magic  dont even think twice its free and awesome

its a pretty good game  but gets a bit repetitive and the level designs of the first two worlds seem to be quite similar the ninja movement is quite fun to experiment with  as their isnt really any tutorial to tell you each individual jump either way this is a good game to play with others or even on your own i recommend this game to anyone whos into ninja mechanics and tps
recommended
is a fun game cool mmorpg try play it its free

a free to play gem pros great action art style not for everyone and gameplay drop in drop out coop pvp in early stages via concalves and dojo dueling interesting advancing mechanism with modcards and a great community mileage may vary to top it all off cons does get a bit repetitive rng based rewards can be frustrating some bugs prop up here and there with new updates

warframe review level space comrade ninja bunnies one of the most interesting projects of 2013 that flowed into 2014 that ive seen the game has all what a gamer needs guns fancy karate gimmicks swords two words space ninjas what is actually good that the game even tho is f2p but it does not follow a shadowy p2w path you might be confused in the beggining as getting the stuff crafting locations and controls but when you get over it you might as well like it another aspect that drives the attention constant new content updates from very friendly developers i might add that devs do take in considiration players ideas and implement ideas and throughts into a real thing almost all the stuff ingame can be aqquired just by playing the game you just need to get over the beggining but this game is still in beta there could be bugs there could be flaws currently devs implement tons of content every two months aprox in general this is a game that you might totally like or just play for two minutes and uninstall playing with friends is recomended
recommended
better then destiny lol

i just ordered a steelseries gamepad specifically for this game with that being said time to get back on the grind

amazing game with both coop elements solo and farming with space for different playstyles which makes the game awesome to play with friends and others from across the world and compared to other games with these elements they lack alot of customizations which is splendid to see the only thing the game needs i just more weaponry and i know its beta and i know more items are coming soon and more warframes so keep it up this is compared to many aaa games a very incredible game

ive spent more money on this freetoplay game than i care to admit worth i am a friggin space ninja with my own space ship and space dog and we do cool thingsin space need i say more

always wanted to be a ninja

best most steadily updated upgraded improved and expanded game ive ever played the developers really do take a lot of input from the fans the world theyve built has no equal and the customization is absolutely insane not to mention that the gameplay itself with freerunning movement slicing smacking whipping and stabbing with everything melee and all the projectile and laser weapons you can imagine activity always builds up more around the very often and awesome events but it hahs enough content to keep you busy for months ive been playing since march 2013 and im not considering uninstalling it in the near or far future 1010
recommended
this game is grindy as crap i cant tell you how many times ive gotten a new weapon to find i need that one hard to get resource most of the time i would yell fuuuuuuuuuuuuu to the gods in this game ive never done that de has somehow found a way to make grinding fun thats all i have to say
recommended
very fun game but sometimes the map is confusing oo
recommended
best free to play ever ingame purchases yes buuuuuuuut platinum is the currency you get when you buy for real money all warframes are up to sale for real money but you can also get them by doing various missions when you are crafting weapons you can press rush and pay with your platinum some of the thing you cant get without platinum is weapon and warframe slots and some colour palettes so basically youre buying time when using platinum in warframe play this game with friends
recommended
omg his game is so much fun
recommended
pros spectacular graphics fast paced really feel like a space ninja voice acting great sound effects great music lots of content to explore would take a while to complete everything each warframe is unique in abilities and in looks great community very friendly good ai pvp feature cons weak story can become very repetitive borders on becoming a freemium game though isnt grindy very grindy which to some is a good thing some maps are just wayyyyy to big few enemy factions summary if you like grinding this game is for you and is definitely worth at least trying out even if youre a little skeptical if youll like it or not
recommended
like destiny but good

top notch create graphics fun community and over all a dam good game if you like gears of war or anything similiar id recommend this jam
recommended
started playing this game two days ago and has been running smoothly so far the coop gameplay is really impressive and fun to play theres always the option to get into a mission by yourself and hope that people are going to join you but some missions arent wellbalanced for solo play the graphics of the game is okay and most critically theres no lag or ping display anywhere theres a good variety of guns to choose from including really powerful bows that can pin enemies against the wall i think the swordsman archetype was a little overplayed the melee combat here is also satisfyingly weighty charged attacks that can cut enemies clean in half are their own reward one of warframes significant issues at the moment is its failure to display important information especially in the missionselect interface other than that the game was pretty well made and i will recommend this game to all who are looking for some fun in coop gameplays

this game is a great mixture of third person shooter scifi and ninja all bundled up into one great freetoplay game has great variation of enemies and is loads of fun with friends i highly recommend this game to anyone especially if you like thirdperson shooters and the

this game is amazing i havent played it for long but i spent a good amount of time trying it out for the first time may i say bravo jumping around in a space ninja suit is awesome choose your playstyle stealthy or plain rambo this game allows either smooth interface incredible graphics an immersive selection of mulitplayer and solo missions and extremely satisfying mechanics the only way you can be disappointed is if you dont have a good enough pc this game is flat out amazing the best part all of this for free

warfame is an awsome game i love itits a very good gamemy preference is first person shooters but this game is a great exception this game maes it not even matter it is so awsomesadly for me i do not like how u have to pay for more charecters or craft them which takes forever but besides thatfact the charecters are well balenced and it is a great game

suggest you play this game if you like violence shooting 3rd person and scifi d really good and free to play unless you want to buy platnium

i have a ton of hours put into this game the question is was it worth it the answer is yes i enjoy this game it is a free to play game aswell ive spent over $200 on just in game purchases i reccomend this to anyone who wants a switch up to a game that is a 3rd person shooter with space ninjas

awesome gaming very exciting and addictive once you had started it you wont be able to stop playing reminds me of metal gear revengeanceyou can run on walls like a ninja fast and swift sword play with lots of blood and gore it is superb and simply awesome use a xbox controller to play with this game will be even awesome the best online gaming ever

bloody fun gamethe game and infected remind me alot of halo in ways and i love that game ya dont have to pay to get the good stuff eitherits just faster and easier to then waiting for event rewards or ya can sell items people want to get whats called platnum ingame currency thats obtained by spending money for many things i personally reccoment this to anyone wh dosnt mind a grind with a similar feeling to halo in some ways
recommended
my all time favorite game i would recommend for anyone and everyone to play it its fast paced and fun every update adds something amazing and the combat is beautiful every warframe is wonderful and unique in their own way when you get on a team with other warframes the magic you can create is beautiful getting platinum a currency you can pay for can be obtained in different ways without having to spend money which i find wonderful considering it allows players to create their own little economy one of the all time best free to play games i have ever played i mean cmon space ninjas

pros free to play great graphics great voice acting great gameplay lots of content challenging constantly updated lots of customisation and more cons 1510 hrs last two weeks  7599 hrs on record can be a wee bit repeditive
recommended
ill be honest i love this game love it to pieces you on the other hand may have a very different opinion i would normally say to do a lot of indepth research before making a commitment to any mmo but considering warframe is free i would say that all you need is a light brush over of what the in my opinion pros and cons of warframe are before trying it yourself pros free very intense action addictive very immersive for a 3rd person game beutiful atmosphere and world design with decent graphics interesting lore that is slowly revealed by community events and progression very good administrative team updates on a regular basis great customization of your arsenal everything necessary to the experience can be done without ingame currency platinum runs very smoothly even on the lowest end computers very helpful and friendly community trading system you can even trade for ingame currency not paytowin cons not friendly to the impatient long wait times for crafting slow progression very repetitivegrindy missions are clones of eachother with different graphics or gimmicks thrown in big pay wall as far as anything not essential to the experiance vanity exp multipliers credit boosts faster crafting etc buggy as all hell default settings are awful motion blur motion blur d balancing is off as far as weapons these are as far as i can tell the major pros and cons of warframe in conclusion warframe is a very satisfying and addictive game for those who are into fastpaced action that makes you feel like a complete badass and although it is not essential i would suggest laying down about 20 or 40 bucks or your regional equivalent just for convenience sake but please before putting any money down play the game for at least a day or two just to evaluate whether it is something you would truly enjoy thanks for reading i hope this was helpful

fun game to chill and play with a couple buddies

what can i say one of the best free2play games ive come across scince star trek online it has imo aaa graphics which seems to be very well optimizedi will admit i havent played fro long but i would say try it as its freeif you like sci fi and manga style battle suits you will love this

this game is great i would give it a 910 they only thing bad about it is that it is a lot more fun when you play with a friend via skype but other than that the graphics are great very kind community no lag unless you have a bad pc and just a lot of fun overall

fires seven beams of continuous biochemical energy which instantly corrode any surface they contact the phage is an infested shotgun researched in the clan bio lab with prerequisite being mutagen mass research it requires a mastery rank of 6 to build and comes with one  dash polarity slot note that its damage is viral not corrosive as the description implies as the codex description says it fires seven tentacleiike beams in a wide spread which move toward the center when you zoom there will always be a central beam while the others are emitted from glowing fingers three on each side of the weapons front without focusing targets to the side of the spread actually get hit by more beams when focused the resultant cluster of beams is about the size of your warframes head not pinpoint accurate but enough to land headshots on grineer the reload is quite unique the weapons fingers wriggle and it makes something akin to purring while you reload weapon mechanics the phage uses ammo very slowly id estimate it at one ammo per second of continuous fire that makes it more efficient than other continuous weapons though the decreased rate of shotgun ammo drop balances it out its focus can be tweaked depending on what youre up against  rarely do you want to fire the gun unfocused holding down the trigger lets you keep the current focus level without zooming in interrupting your fire in any way will unfocus the phage this means landing after a jump getting knocked down etc i found that you can walk off small steps without interrupting the fire so its not that bad i prefer leaving it at a semifocused wider cone of fire instead of the fully focused setting in most cases so i can sweep hallways and take out light units it feels like a hybrid between the ignis and the synapse  not as good as either in their optimal roles but very versatile the focus is a big issue for most users it will take time to get used to despite being a shotgun my personal tests using vay hek as a target havent resulted in any damage dropoff over range however this weapon is designed for closer range combat than the synapse  the slight spread of the beams at max focus means that you cant land fulldamage hits on small moving targets at range weapon build the phage is a slowerkilling weapon because of its focus time i would recommend a potato if you intend to use it as an actual primary it has a long delay before the spread approaches usable levels this is my build no forma point blank boosts base damage hells chamber adds additional beams to the phage  at max rank each finger will have an additional beam if you have them blaze and accelerated blast fire rate boosts rate of ammo consumption on continuous weapons but also increases damage add an elemental mod that fits in the dash  polarity slot before adding on hells chamber because itll boost damage more efficiently toxic barrage  im low on forma and this is more efficient than other elemental mod for damage vicious spread increases the initial spread of the beams it does not slow down the focus time of the phage and increases damage since its unfocused mode is awkward anyway go for it builds thanks to umonkrag for writing up elemental optimizations for factions i usually dont bother changing loadouts at all so im pretty bad when it comes to maxing out damage point blank hells chamber blaze and accelerated blast are staples of a shotgun build accelerateds puncture damage is calculated like elemental damage and its fire rate is good on any gun besides the tigris vicious spread is also pretty good for reasons i mentioned above tainted shell cuts down on the phages initial spread but also immensely impacts weapon damage output and is a very expensive mod to max i do not personally recommend this mod  making the beams narrow enough to be functional will also reduce damage output by 50% or more grineer radiation  viral damage has a 75% bonus against grineer flesh and radiation has a 75% bonus against alloy armor which grineer heavies use blaze  charged shell  incendiary coat corpus magnetic damage rips through shields chilling grasp  charged shell put these mods before blaze so the fire damage doesnt try to combine with anything void corrosive  cold makes short work of shields as well as heavy gunners toxic barrage  charged shell  chilling grasp add contagious spread if you didnt get taintedvicious spread infested gas balances out the viral penalty and the phages spread takes out light infested easily contagious spread  blaze  incendiary coat seeking force may be useful as itll basically be a beamshooting ignis at half focus however its main strength is very high damage output without burning through your ammo too quickly in conclusion im preferential to infested weapons and shotguns so this may be a bit biased i love versatility in a weapon and not just the one size fits all method the phages damage spread control is amazingly fun letting me clear mobs of mooks as well as that napalm standing in the doorway i wish it didnt unfocus instantly though this thread on the warframe forums got a dev comment and they are looking into possibly changing the way the unfocus works that said it is not a shotgun as much as it is a jackofalltrades continuous weapon despite its high damage output the long focus time means that when youre using the phage you cant take out a higherlevel threat instantly which might get you killed instead when im talking about higherlevel threat im talking about things that a potatoed soma has trouble with this is not a mustpotato weapon if you like it it will certainly deserve a potato though its a viable alternative to the more standard endgame primaries offering more variety without causing power creep with 65 mod points to play with i can take out level 1520 corpus in a few seconds without focusing its strong and feels fun but its also really awkward seeing tentacles everywhere and given that de doesnt release weapons this strong all the time phages are going to be common sights for quite a while edit tested things with full vicious spread added a little more commentary adjusted
recommended
great game just started to get into it so far its been a very good experience for a free to play game
recommended
its quite repetitive however the amount of work being done to the game constantly is what makes it so refreshing since i started i have seen overhauls and great work being done to gameplay and mechanics its a great game but it is slightly grindy also if you get a dog and arent able to log in for some time the dog dies
recommended
do you play action games do you like science fiction do you like shooting things do you like collecting loot are you broke if you answered yes or no to any of these questions you should be playing warframe it is the epitome of a successful f2p game the devs are dedicated inventive and care about the game in ways that show theyre invested in it and the game universe and lore itself its the pinnacle of cooperative pve its probably the most enjoyable mmo ive played there is no reason you should not be playing this too
recommended
it is one of the bast free to play game i have played so get it no harm of you do not like it because it free  i hape you will like it baceuse it a great game and it has space ninja as i said get it

i love this game it has got to be one the best f2p games ever i loved every miniute of playing it even griding is fun if you have one or two people to do it with
recommended
easily the best free to play game ive ever played i started playing back when they released it on steam last year and its still something i play most days for at least a bit with constant new content every week or two extended and new features frequently the option to get everything ingame without spending a penny and a pretty helpful and fun community this game is fastastic over 100 weapons as of right now with over 20 warframes quite a few pets and hundreds of mods it is a game thats 100% about grinding and waiting for your items to craft so you have to be patient if you like grinding and such which i do this game is definitely for you download it
recommended
this game is awesome
recommended
pros  good graphics  cool variety of different weapons  combat system  fast bugfixes  many variety of different characters to play with  different types of bosses and enemies  space ninjas cons  grinding seriously if you dont like grinding you will not enjoy this game  not noob friendly  end game dont exist yet only survival and defense mission that can last for 4060 min  repeated map tileset  confusing maps  pray to rng god a whole lot you never get what you want  a bit of event to win so dont miss events be prepared to sink tons of hours like i have if you want to experience everything that warframe has to offer this game is not friendly to new players cause all weapons and warframes takes many resources to build so expect many reruns despite all of its flawes its still a fun game with loads of contents for newer player so if you have time to play many hours i can recommend this game for you
recommended
a great ftp game which will make you feel happy shooting things and going pew pew you do fun jumps and dive everywhere and shoot these robot guys and do missions and advance forward coop is great in this game aswell get it now
recommended
so heres the game in a nutshell or my experience at least the first several missions are beyond easy you dont need any help killing guys who dont know that their armor protrudes 3 ft from their cover or guys who wear cubes for helmets they get progressively harder but at that point you can group up with other people and feel completely belittled by the dudes who kill everything before you can aim and if you ever get bored of playing piking simulator 2014 you can just put on invite onlysolo but instead of the way it used to be silly little enemies no problem this game smacks you in the back of the knees with a baseball bat and clubs the  out of you until you weep trying to think of how you even made it this far but if you wanna be cheered up just look in the regional chat there is nothing quite like warframes in game chat community if talking about ebola prime doesnt cheer you up you could always craft with the vast amount of resources in the game its a great way to schedule the rest of your life around it believe me it is one of the few things that id wake up at 3 in the morning to check but on a serious note ive played this game for nearly 100 hours withing putting a single penny into it and its still an epic game cant wait to see what direction the devs pull it into next
recommended
i like this game ant u can help people and join clan to get the weapons u wn

game is perfect for playing with your friends my friend and i together gather resources and complete missions cant recommend more

this game combines amazing graphics and fun fast gameplay into a amazing package the division between different warframes and modifications available make this game unique the best part is that there is no pay to play yes to get things it gets alittle grindy but its worth it well made game with more coming up for it hopefully
recommended
good game nice graphics and a good playability

ive spent some time playing mmos but this one changed everything fast paced battles awesome graphics crafting great community if you want a good tps mmo give this one a try

pretty fun game especially if you are into scifi stuff it becomes even better if you are playing with frinds as squad the main defect is that it can be boring if you want to craft weaponframe and you need to get materials it takes long time and you have to play on same maps again and again
recommended
l absolutely recommend this game incredible fun coop too so pay to win is almost out of the question go solo or go with friends even go online and youll have a good time  choose a weapon that suits your playstyle and choose a frame to go along with it the game is amazingly free to play  however you want all in all the game is great l cant explain much with this text alone and if a picture is worth a thousand words then that must mean actual gameplay is worth 100000 go try it out now youll be glad you did its only 30 minutes to download and 36000 of fun

if i could spam the utter living hell out of the thumbs up button i seriously would i never thought id like a game like this but its absolutely amazing the graphics the gameplay the mechanics of the game the stories missions really0 are pretty cool the variety its basically the father to destiny but better i love destiny do not get me wrong i really do but all the exotic things destiny promised are actually here in warframe the weapons have deeper variety and the cutomization is pretty freaking awesome theyre still adding new things to the game like the hounds they added to the game not too long ago called kubrows as it keeps going and its all incredibly awesome and there is so much to do i hardly have enough time in my day to do it all if you like destiny and the mass effect series youll love warframe
recommended
warframe uses an interesting combat style that includes the use of maneuvers like wallrunning and walljumping that add to the skills one can have in combat these maneuvers are complemented by the large assortment of weapons that range from traditional weapons in shooter games like assault rifles and pistols to weapons like bows and throwing stars that have been upgraded to fit the futuristic scifi theme of the game one thing that must be noted about this impressive arsenal is that while one must pay money to buy ingame currency platinum to buy most weapons and warframes these same items can be just as easily built through the purchase of blueprints in the ingame market using credits earned from completing missions or by using blueprints found during missions i am not normally the type to pay in places where it is not needed so having this option appealed greatly to me on a negative note i feel that at this point the stages and enemies are overly uniform with not enough variation between planets and individual stages though at this point there have been changes made to some of the stages and enemies and i assume that more individualism will be seen between them especially considering that at the point that i am writing this the game is still in beta also the fact that the stages are generated differently each time it is played helps to keep it from seeming too much the same as well as keeping it fresh instead of being able to just memorize stages i have enjoyed my experiences with warframe so far and i would recommend it to others who may be on the fence about playing this actionfilled game
recommended
you can run up walls and shoot things gg 1010 would play again
recommended
this game is very fun it was one of the first f2p i tried and honestly its one of my favorite you play a a in space ninja running on walls awesome tile sets fun clan system fun to just mess around in the clan or the void only dowsides is that some weapons are clan research or some are only possible to get though the use of platinum which is real money and that once you farm for dayz to get the needed resources you must wait for either 12 hours up to 72 hours or 3 days to get the item you farmed for dayz to get but other than that i think it is an awsome game well worth the time you spend on it
recommended
warframe can be buggy at times but the devs are always coming out with new content and hotfixes warframe has a bit of a steep learning curve and can seem confusing at first to understand the damage mechanics of the game but there are plenty of tutorials online and there are few guys within the comminity who create really excellent videos that can help you understand the different weapons and warframes and how to mod them the game can be quite grindy but the rewards are sometimes worth it i personally love playing warframe it has a futuristic feeling with a large and ever growing assortment of weapons and gear to chose from and the game is quite challenging you can play parts of this game solo but it can become very diificult at higher levels so you must work as a team in order to finsih missions would i recommend this game  yes i do recommend this game and quite highly it is not for everyone but it is free so you have nothing to lose by trying it out for yourself
recommended
this is the best fps game i have ever played 1010

this is probably the best spaceninja game you will ever play if you want a quick recommendation you have it edit once upon a time there was a very long page here well many many updates later its safe to say that this game is still growing in surprising and exciting ways its still a game that feels that you have to dump a couple bucks into every now and then but it never feels forced by the time you feel the urge for some platinum youve probably put a hundred more hours into playing so why not money you spend should be based on the fun youre having and warframe is promising to keep entertaining for a long time

better than ganja i give it a 420  69

this game literally is the true definition of f2p as it doesnt make you pay for a single thing where as everything can made in the foundry highly addictive game
recommended
a great ftp shooter with interestingly fresh mechanics and rpglike leveling up of frames and weapons it is very grindy and can get repetitive but is great fun to play coop with a group of friends it features swordplay and parkour along with the runngun mayhem randomized levels are a blessing and a curse it suffers somewhat from an expensive economy too  where buying things with real money gets expensive very quickly overall it is well worth a shot its free afterall jimbo rating 710
recommended
the best coop game ever
recommended
awsome gameplay to me its similar to halo recommended 
recommended
this game diserves its own genre its such a unque game compared to the rest of the flock even with it being f2p it is by no means a p2 win game as it balances in a good manner only peeves against it is it can get repetitive with certain tiles and the difficulty in playing this game is hard at first but once you reach endgame status it becomes such a cakewalk 8510 great game
recommended
free to play is exactly what this is there is no paywall there is no pay to win nothing that absolutely requires that you put money into the game and on top of that the game is really damn good ive put 600 hours into this game met tons of amazing people played through tons of amazing updates and watched a lot of their livestreams the community is what makes this game as amazing as it is also space ninjas
recommended
basically you run around as an epic wallrunning guntoting space ninja defeating hoards of enemies and collecting new and awesome gear along the way it is a good f2p model where you can get almost anything without paying with the exception of some cosmetics definately an overall great game pick it up
recommended
i am disappointed that this game is so underrated i mean what can be more awesome than robots zombies and ninjas in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
recommended
its very hard to believe this is a free to play game it takes many machanics from other games i enjoy and uses them in a way that makes you want to keep playing you will lose hours
recommended
a really cool game for heavy machines and even normal ones
recommended
this game is pretty great if you like space ninjas and eviscerating things this game is the one for you
recommended
this is a very fun and adicting game with a fast pace and shooter aspect fun for all types of gamers
recommended
this is on of the most amazing games ive ever played on steam and i know why everyone is talking about it  the amazing space ninjas and great weapons plus that sweet parkour is the best mix 3

awesome shooter game recommend for all who like a good scifi action game
recommended
simply and stunningly amazingi recommend it to all who play games
recommended
a fun coop fps with leveling elements in addition to your characters your account weapons and minions gain levels as you progress with higher levels you can apply modules to your items increasing various attributes in them modules themselves are drops and the module collecting and building your gear mechanics feel like deck building in a collectible card game the game is peerhosted which probably helps keep the game free to play but also means that you will sometimes end up playing on a server that is hosted on a connection that cant handle the bandwidth requirements of four players this can be somewhat resolved with pingfiltering peers especially if you have the connection and cpu power to host yourself almost everything in the game can be obtained without paying real money except characterweapon slots but as usual time is money and helps you progress faster
recommended
in general an awesome game while it does get a bit frustrating with running through some of the environments several times you get used to it 9710 my review
recommended
awesome game note that it is free to play d
recommended
what simcity should have been
recommended
such a wonderful game its a little slow and repetative until you get your second frame
recommended
great game with a lot of fun to be had youll have much more fun if you choose to play as part of a group however this is not a solo game by any means even if you reach the point where you can overpower all content outside of the void and leveling is much faster as part of a team the game needs more difficult content though a well coordinated squad with strong weapons and frames trivializes all content currently in the game
recommended
its okay i guess
recommended
this is a just wonderful game ive seen no other like it all the maps are procedurally generated the rooms are the same but arranged completely different every time and the map could be long one play through and short the next on top of all that every planet in the system has its own environment type so youll come across many interesting landscapes and every playthourgh of a mission theres a chance of there being a different penalty for example if there is ice in the level it will reduce your maximum shields and sometimes therell be fire making the terrain hazardous every piece of equipment including your warframe has its own level and your account does too there are several different warframesclasses for you to find and build and one of them is bound to suit your playstyle not to mention a large arsenal of weapons to choose from but you must earn the credits to unlock these eventually if you get enough credits you can buy a sentinel a small floating robot thatll hover over your shoulder and support you any way you have it configured also every piece of equipment has specific mods that will work for it such as damage types fire ice shock armor piercing rate of fire reload time and many more you can also level every mod up to a certain limit to increase its potential there is an extensive crafting system you find certain materisl in each system and you use these to complete blueprints youve found or bought with credits in order to create new gear or even warframes if you get really good you can run along walls and keep jumping to other surfaces to speed your self up far more than a regular run would it takes some decent aim to to a good job and good reflexes so come on and give this game a try it is very fun indeed
recommended
awesome graphics and intense gameplay
recommended
good game quite boring in solo but really funny in multiplayers 
recommended
i have played it for 3 days now recreating my review this game has a bittersweet taste of fun and pay at first it feels like you have to pay for everything but after some time playing it ive found out that you can get probably every item you could buy with real money or the ingame currency platinum which is bough with real money also with just some time and that is the real reason to play this game its not really about killing every boss or playing every mission or getting every achievement its about spending time ingame and for me playing this game is getting new warframes and crafting new weapons and after getting them leveling them is the next part but as lovely as it is to play this game its also a bit annoying that you can only have 4 warframes at a time without spending a single coin and spending money in this game makes me kinda angry there is an online rating for the ingame currency platinum which says that 75 platinum is around 5$ most warframes cost around 225 platinum and some of the cooler ones cost 375 most of the warframes are gainable through resource gathering and buying the blueprints for them with credits the other ingame gainable currency in warframe one problem there is you only have 4 warframes slots if you dont want to pay for this game that means you can have 4 warframes at a time while players who pay can have a pile of them the game is called warframe why would you do this with the items the game is called after id prefer a way to gain these slots ingame all in all is this game a nice longtime game with a lot of cooperation between players the community is nice aswell hell you can even ask them if they taxi you to a mission you dont have access yet i will keep playing this game and might aswell put some money into it to get more warframe slots
recommended
if my play time wasnt enough of an indicator this game is so much fun that it stole my life visceral combat agile movement and great aesthetic keep me from doing pretty much anything else play this game hit me up when you do im always down to help
recommended
a wonderful free to play game that doesnt shove microtransactions down your throat what more can be asked
recommended
warframe is a very good f2p tps and has a wonderful community of gamers that are easy to get a long with the game play is smooth and nice graphics but the only problem is there are a lot of maps that seem like you have seen before meaning it seems like there are maps that they used before but just put a few new things in it also you can drop a lot of money in the game if you get into it because of different customization for warframs and sentinels you can also buy weapons with your plat but for the player that just wants have a fun game with not droping a dime there is goos news for you almost everything you see in the store you can build in game with no real money charges it just takes longer to obtain that item so i give warframe 8510 and recommend you give it a try
recommended
crazy game gotta give thumbsup to the developers
recommended
theres a reason warframe is a launch title for the ps4 honestly its probably for all the pretty particles thatll be flying around when you cut space marines in half with your space ninja sword while sliding on the ground after wallrunning from across the map because you are a space ninja with all the powers of space ninjutsu in all seriousness this game is fantastic not because of the terrific graphics not because the co op with different warframe you character with a set of stats and powers that allow for great synergy between teammates but because this game gets free 2 play at no point have i felt the need to pay for the game but i have because i like it a lot everything can be aquired without real world money and it all seems fair and balanced this is a brilliant game and i recommend it to anyone looking for a great co op game or something to really show off to next gen console friends
recommended
best third person ninja game ive played very fast paced coop or stealthy solo play loads of wall running jumping flipping and tons of other stuff weapons and characters can be crafted and modded to fit your style
recommended
i can say this is a nice game playable for anyone ^^ even if just for a try you will come to like the gameplay and the people u meet in the end

recommended
takes a long time and can sometimes seem repetitive but the challenges it presents will keep you coming back if you end up getting this game or already have it and are not in a clan let me know i will invite you to join mine and give you some gear
recommended
love this game there forever updating and creating new challanges you can paint your warframe to what ever colours you wish to your taste join a clan and help set up your dolo and weapons etc awesome lots of fun when in a group and evan if your not it isnt hard to make friends and have fun
recommended
a fun 4 player coop game that is relatively easy to understand been a favourite amongst my friends and i for a while now would recommend the gameplay is wonderful bringing together elements from thirdpersonshooters rpgs and mmos and combining them into something new the graphical design is nothing short of beautiful dazzling the players with a variety of levels and effects the audio quality is great there is nothing nicer than hearing the drums of war start to play rhythmically as you enter battle finally the community is large diverse and friendly
recommended
love this game been playin since befor i used steam and was using raptr awesome gameplay easy to use controller support vived lush graphics excellent voices tons of content with new content added regularly and fun coop super fun game to play for free now for gripes though very few the story is very lacking its not really in your face you have to be looking for it but there is one also this game gets seriously repetitive and if your not playing with friends or a team that talks as you play you get bored and last but not least this game is a epic grind if you dont wanna spend money to get other warframes or speed up the process of leveling and crafting this game will eventually make you put it down because of repetitive grinding that being said this game is awesome and i recommend anyone give a shot its free for goodness sake and lets not comment on the epicness of playing this on a big 1080 tv with surround sound and dualshock 4 and steams awesome big picture mode
recommended
this game is a very fun indepth tps unlike most it has a social system decent melee and lots if cool missions 810
recommended
after all i cant say its  cause it isnt
recommended
cool game its basicly ninijas in space
recommended
great game plenty of content definitely worth a try
recommended
very fun game if you enjoy me3 multiplayer but can be a bit grindy at times
recommended
how i lost my life to warframe to me for the longest time it was one of those games that ill see and hear about early on and decide nah thats not my kind of game i wont bother getting into it anytime it pops up the same thought is there and nothing budges eventually lots of friends were getting into it playing all the time that game has never seemed fun or my kind of game i still wouldnt like it so i wont get into it still even though theyre playing it so much theyre prolly just overhyping it ive always felt it wont be fun to me but then i decided for whatever reason hell ill try it out at least and now im on the other side as friends watch me play constantly and wonder how its even possible its just a plain fun game pretty to look at and play and even its f2p tactics feel good in the long run i was pessimistic about the waiting and grinding involved but pacing your gameplay helps to enjoy things longer without burning out on things right away dont wanna wait 12 hours for a weapon to build just take a bit of control sleep it off wake up to a nice new shiny toy therell be more to do in the meantime the new player experience is just a bit slow to get you off your feet is all
recommended
yes play this game wont stop

immerse into a future where strenght make the rules and power beyond your imagination can be acquired weaponsskillsninjasrobots in a combination to a masterpiece called warframe

damn new ships new stuff new playstyle if you love crazy motherf space ninjaswell this is your game theres even new graphichs and better brightnessquestssentinal huntersdogs play this game its free and awesome
recommended
great game especially for a f2p you dont need spend money to enjoy or advance in this game everythings pretty much available through plans to assemble items and mats are quite easily farmed in game varied missions and goals mobs and boss fights the addictive part is leveling your character and its weapons
recommended
warframe is a pretty enjoyable coop game as you level you get to understand that this is one of those games in wich leaving a team mate behind is not a choice because solo is not a option at least on low levels it lacks pvp maps like lets say halo combat evolved had in wich 5 or more players on 2 different teams fight to accomplish one common objective may it be killing each other or capturing a certain objective capture the flag for example would be a pretty cool game mode in warframe since players have high mobility with the shift  jump  ctrl combo you can make your own warframes and weapons wich is kinda well though its still in open beta but i hope when it goes live it turns into a better experience ill give it 7 out of 10 points
recommended
this game has superb graphicssmooth gameplaydetailed environmentsform a team & whack the grinners

going to xbox one warframe do it  expand your name i would love to see people get to know this game and where it game from { online}
recommended
ever wanted to become an unstoppable force of destruction then try out this third person shooter set in a futuristic universe with the broad spectrum of weaponry and warframes classes you can be sure to find a build that truly fits your playing style if its being stealthy and quick or just run into the middle of the action guns blazing and tanking while you dish out the hurt you decide ranged weapons to fit your every need shotgun sniper submachinegun machinegun semiautomatic and automatic versions of the weapons not to forget the bow that shoots with such force that it impales your enemies to walls or eachother if you line them up slice bash or punch your enemies to gory bits with the various melee weapons if you want to get up close and personal fists hammer dagger axe sword dual axes sword and dagger dualwield or go for the greatsword there is much more in this game than just this each warframes set of abilities that aid it in battle leveling up system joined with the mod system that improves your various weapons damage output or perhaps your warframes ability to tank better craft your weapons or warframes by picking up blueprints and materials when completing missions and fighting bosses and finally an ai that doesnt just stand out in the open taking hits without retaliating no warframes ai makes good use of cover systems and strategic vantage points to give you a better challenge when they first notice something is wrong they will alert the entire enemy force of your presence so being stealthy has its perks but also takes skill to pull off 9510 nexusnemesis

damn nice with lightdetailed graphics story line is amazinghighly ercommended

this game is awesome
recommended
brilliant
recommended
this is very cool game  i like the way the graphics are 
recommended
really good better than the average bear you should play it
recommended
710 if it wasnt for the insainly long patch downloads i would probably play this game more often really fun if you are into grinding the same missions to get your favorite warframe like i have
recommended
this gamei dont know where to start on update 13 it was a great game it had its bugs and its flaws but it was fun to play but with the new update it has improved a lot its beautiful even though the wait was a pain in the  it was worth it it almost feels like a brand new game i dont understand some people that hate this new update so much i simply cant hate it in any way the new tutorial is fantastic  compared with the   tutorial of before if you can call that a tutorial  it shows new players how to play properly and gives you diversity in your first guns depending in your style its great to see the implementation of your own ship and how you control everything in a more fluid way some may say that its less practical but theese people are hayterz just kidding before you could be overwhelmed by all the different stuff that was presented to you all at once  foundry arsenal etc  and it was tricky for me to get the hand of the game now you are showed what you are doing instead of waching some slides that show you what you do they make you do missions to get parts for your ship and guide you through lots of things that are a little complicated for a new tenno its also good to see that theres an actual quest line instead of complete this planet to go to the other planet and so on it looks more fun this way and makes a little more sense there is a lot of work to be done into this game to make it perfect but this was a big step into creating one of the best games that in my opinion will ever come across steam
recommended
warframe is the best free2play game i have ever played not only is it a fun game that is constantly getting new content and features as it is in open beta right now but it is the best free2play model i have ever seen in a game like most f2p games it has an in game earned moneytype credits and a paid for type platinum in warframe every single item can be obtained without spending platinum the only exception to this is vanity items and room for more warframes and weapons but you can actually earn platinum to buy those things through the trading system if you have something rare you can trade it to other people in exchange for platinum the developers also have a very active role in the community they have livestreams every week and are active on the games forums instead of seeing the developers as more of an atm for games than anything else ea for example you see them as people who actually want to make a great game overall this is a fantastic system and has actually encouraged me to spend money on the game not because i have to in order to do well in it but because i want to support the growth of this fantastic game
recommended
would recommend a very fun pve game with lots of costumization options and it gets updates very often it may get repetitive due to levels being fairly similar but additions are being made rapidly overall a really nice free game to pick up if youve got a few minutes to download it
recommended
this game is proof that the whole 3060fps debacle is utter  this game is just one frame a warframe and it still looks really good its obvious that fps is completely irrelevant to the smoothness of the visuals in a game just one frame is enough to make a game look and run smoothly
recommended
absolutely amazing for a free to play game
recommended
free to play game with a large and unexpectedly nice community this game is good for people who have been looking for an alternative to the multiplayer of mass effect 3 just worthy of note that the game has an extended grind once you get into the midtolate game also noteworthy is that melee is not as gratifying as other games in the mmorpg scope gory yes but repetitive after going through all the different animation sets available for melees currently in the game
recommended
it is awesome lots of running stabbing shooting and space ninjas i highly recommend it to anyone who likes 3rd person running and gunning
recommended
suprisingly fun for a free to play game at least until you get tired of grinding constantly for new weapons still worth a try
recommended
im going to say two words and then you are going to download this game space ninjas why isnt this game already on your hard drive its fast crazy fun gorgeous free and can even be played like a singleplayer game if youre so inclined there is literally no reason you shouldnt try thi out
recommended
i ninja flipped off the map 810 would do it again
recommended
warframe is the best f2p game ive played 386 hours on it just playing i would recomend this game if you are looking for somthing to play
recommended
its kinda a mix of transformers war for cybertron and spiral knights
recommended
this game is simply awesome though the maps may appear to be repititive but playing this with friends is a loving experience and the game mechanics are simple and easy if in doubt just check the ingame tutorials amazing weapons cool warframes upgrading and modifying weapons and the best of allits free
recommended
cool
recommended
as soon as you learn to play and get used to controls this game is definetly worth playing double the fun with friends
recommended
best f2p game on steam
recommended

cant stop playing this game its so fun d
recommended
space ninjas after playing the destiny beta on xbox one and loving the pve coop i was looking for something similar to kill the month and a bit until destiny is released in warframe ive found that and more destiny its not but for a free to play title it has a lot to offer you have a range of parkour type moves that help you rapidly navigate the levels once you learn how to combine them to vault slide flip wall run and more your way around so fast the enemy cant keep up you can take the fight to the enemy at range with your primarysecondary weapons or get up close and personal with your melee weapon gather enough energy from fallen enemiescrates and you can unleash your true space ninja powers to devastate the enemy aid your allies or boost your mobility depending on the warframe youre using the freetoplay model is well done and you could conceivably play the game for hundreds of hours without paying a single dollar i will personally spend some cash on the game just to support the developers but you can get along just fine without doing so its the typical f2p model with cash either saving you time or letting your characters look just that bit funkier the game also offers pvp if thats your thing but its not mine so i havent checked it out yet to comment on it if you are old enough to remember mdk fondly or enjoyed too human then you owe it to yourself to check this out
recommended
wow this is incredible for a beta
recommended
i think warframe is a pretty cool guy he fights aliens and doesnt afraid of anything

this a fun far future game im soo iliterate this is for da comunety bafge
recommended
its a really good game considering its free to play i would definitly recommend it to people if they asked me there is alot of action intense gameplay as you progress and lots of great characters to choose from at first it seems a little slow and grindy but when you work hard for what your aiming for it really makes it seem worth while where as some games just hand you the best stuff in a day definitly a good time killer when you get bored or you can always play it in between games
recommended
i love warframe and while i dont play the pc version as much as i do the console its fun regardless what platform you play it on
recommended
a pretty fun overtheshoulder shooterninjaingparkourswordswingin kinda game you play as a space cyberninja in a cruel spacefuture also you can get an ugly lovable space batdog honestly a fun game if youre looking for a timesink as it is fairly grindy all weapons need to be levelled up as do suits and you have to gather materials to improve stuff or make stuff better like i said grindy but still entertaining
recommended
grindy grind but still cool
recommended
space ninjas period
recommended
warframe is truly a wonderful games that ticks all of my boxes its god the best scifi feel best action and of course the ninja feeling to it you can choose what you want to do when it comes to missons want to go in guns blazing go ahead or if you prefer a more stealth approach to it then again go ahead the sound has improved dramatically over the years of warframe and is really been a milestone for the developers to be proud of they always surprise us with every update whether it be small or big the music is perfect it really does add the best theme you can get to battles and of course the music varies from battle to battle the design is just the key symbol of warframe why you ask see for yourself its just perfect every little detail digital extremes puts into the game always made the game more beautiful the lighting is very dynamic its not too bright and not too dark in missions while keeping the good mix of lights to create the desired atmosphere gameplay in my opinion does need a bit of working i just think warframe is really hard to get into when you start as it only gets good when you start getting a real challenge digital extremes did a good job when it came to ninjas i mean come on you get to do parkour you get to run on walls while shooting and perform attacks with your sword in mid air flight thats all i can say really well there is one more thing get the game youll wish you played this game a long time ago 1010

dear fellow gamers for years i played this game i joined in when it was at update 6 now we are waiting for the update 16 i watched how it was developed from a simple normal game to a masterpiece the devs were adding lightshows new content new features new playstyles and even greater optimizations they were doing so much thing with this game that its just nostalgic to remember back how was it back than the game is hard when you play it first it is hard like you can die anywhere at anytime than you advance and level the game becomes harder but you become better and than it becomes easier and filled with more and more action than you make new weapons and frames my first choice of frame was the rhino the boltor and the dualether blade slowly you become the best of the best and seek new challenge higher type of enemies than even higher type of enemies for even better stuff than you go for the towers the enemies become harder to kill the scrub remains scrub but they add these little chops enemies which makes your life ten dozens time harder as you advance you begin to see that the ai is not just a stupid clonebrain anymore it thinks and makes a tactic against you which will still mostly fail > it is the rhino who steps in the room first you will understand why than you wish to go higher do mmo type repu for these freedom fighters or just for those green guys than you realize you need a prime and you want to farm it than level it than polarize it than you reached your metastatus one frame overthetop with highendtier of weapons you are the mass destruction in galaxy well you can have a sentinel or a pet or just do archwing missions but most of all you can try out other things in other mmos there is the meta and the rest of the useless stuff here you are the meta if you do well victory is yours if you do the very best it will be an easy fight if you are the meta you can step into the greater challenge also there are pvp too as you advance you gain things the game is free to play but there are things closed down like twowarframe slots but as you advance you can get platinum through daily alert or just trade but if you wish to have more and more you can do that without as your mastery level increases the slots increase too with it the more you try out enjoy and play the more you can do it is great fun for me though i know it wasnt for some of my friends there are those who like the gameplay style and there are those who dont but i tell you it is worthy of your time

warframe is by far one of my favorite free to play games the art style and combat is very unique as well as the general gameplay mechanicsthere are over 10 warframes the space ninjas you play as and has over 50 different types of unique wepons although they are already many wepons and frames new updates keep coming making the game endless fun the community is quites funny and interesting as well as helpful the makers of warframe digital extremes listen to the players feed back and keep adding new thigns as well as fixing bugs however with all these pros in place there are some things that take away from this gaming experience the fact that the maps are repetitive and many of the mission require you to do are the same some may leave this game for a while but after while and you return it will be filled with new goods i would give it a 808510 and way not try is its free

its good
recommended
i liked the game while it was still fresh but challenge it ran out all fights felt flat no enemies posed any threat the whole gameplay is turned into generic mass destruction with no need to use any brains but what killed it for me is constant updates which featured nothing but weapons and frames  new ways to kill old helpless enemies uncool bro uncool still i recommend this game to those who havent tried it yet just mind that if youre not into mindless repetitive grind  you wont be here for long
recommended
amazing detail story and gfx but i feel like im never happy with my  weapons suit etc i am constantly grinding to get better stuff only to get better stuff to grind further to get better stuff the story line is great and the universe too details and gfx are insane but yea when will i be content and have some fun just not trying to get better stuff so my point is this game looks and is amazing but you will never stop and just enjoy you will always be trying to get better stuffs
recommended
insane  creatorhey i got an idea lets take the awesomeness of every mmorpg fps tps rpc and melee slashers cross timelines with anchient yet alien martial arts weapons use actual katas and combine it into one game  question do you want help writing a script  this needs a 4 hour movie here is an idea im just going to spit ball the anchients beings of pure energy bring all of the frames to earth one each they need earths helpearth has recources needed to help the teno in exchange the government wants tech and is willing to help by donating the soldiers who are willing to become the first to be outfitted with teno bio suites this means designing new frames which will be added to the game after the premiere so the ancheints knowing they are in a position to save humanity from destroying itself make the deal on the request that we decommision all nuclear power sources and weapons we need to anyway so with teno technology in a month the earth is free of everything nuclear and toxic to humans people are getting healed ect and the soldiers are getting trained  there are get to know them scenes ect first two hours then a friking 2 hour battle you could split the humans up with the tenos so many options i dont care if it is animated this game needs a movie lol

overall this game is just awesome with a fair buisness model and a great engine it has everything you would want even though some of the levels very few are repetitive you can enjoy the game alone or with a friend i highly recomend this game so check it out maybe youll have a new favorite game to play
recommended
this is one of the best on line games i have ever played the physics are spot on and the environments eye popping not to mention engrossing having a very aggressive opponent is very crucial to any combat oriented arena coupling that with mazes and puzzles that i and my friends can get immersed in pops
recommended
a little pay 2 winjust a little but doesnt matter d its awesome but it has one huge problem that is there isnt a place to tryjust try the guns satllelit and warframes which you plan to make or buy themjust try like ghost recon phantomes but it s ok play to gether with stategy 910
recommended
i have a ton of hours put into this game the question is was it worth it the answer is yes i enjoy this game it is a free to play game aswell ive spent over $200 on just in game purchases i reccomend this to anyone who wants a switch up to a game that is a 3rd person shooter with space ninjas
recommended
awesome gaming very exciting and addictive once you had started it you wont be able to stop playing reminds me of metal gear revengeanceyou can run on walls like a ninja fast and swift sword play with lots of blood and gore it is superb and simply awesome use a xbox controller to play with this game will be even awesome the best online gaming ever
recommended
bloody fun gamethe game and infected remind me alot of halo in ways and i love that game ya dont have to pay to get the good stuff eitherits just faster and easier to then waiting for event rewards or ya can sell items people want to get whats called platnum ingame currency thats obtained by spending money for many things i personally reccoment this to anyone wh dosnt mind a grind with a similar feeling to halo in some ways
recommended
my all time favorite game i would recommend for anyone and everyone to play it its fast paced and fun every update adds something amazing and the combat is beautiful every warframe is wonderful and unique in their own way when you get on a team with other warframes the magic you can create is beautiful getting platinum a currency you can pay for can be obtained in different ways without having to spend money which i find wonderful considering it allows players to create their own little economy one of the all time best free to play games i have ever played i mean cmon space ninjas
recommended
its one of those games in which your think at first wtf am i doing but as you go on you discover a very well hidden gem
recommended
impressive graphics d
recommended
you play as an alien ninja samurai parkour robot with numberous choices in melee primary and secondary weaponary like all f2p games though you can buy pretty much anything with real money and if you do you will be heaps better then the other noob that just started playing who has to grind heaps to actually get something really good its still a great game though and it really is the skill not what weapons someone has that makes a player good at this game you most likely will enjoy it and its free and it has fairly good graphics and you are an alian ninja samurai parkour robot

great thirdperson scifi ninja shooter fun

space ninjas with guns that is all 1010 like skyrim with space ninjas
recommended
great unique thirdperson shooter experience i mean cmon guys space ninjas plus its free

warframe if youd like to waste a lot of hours and days passing away almost instantly because youre looting those mods want to slice those grineer and corpus soldiers and make infested into green goo you might actually like warframe probably more than like its amazing to play and im not the type to actually play f2p games but warframe hits the spot and you can get over 100% accuracy too
recommended
like destiny but better and its free
recommended
this game is aweeeeesome cant lie but its awesome for a free game

dragon frame>>>> they have a fxxking drangon frame which alternately look kinda like a seahorse dragon and seahorse 1110 best ftp game ever along with ghost rec phontom that game is pretty gd too
recommended
warframe is unique in many good ways and in many bad too the premise of the game itself is brilliant space ninjasamurai that fight robotmen and plauge beasts its radical and filled with flashy effects that youd expect from a third person shooter mixed with a spectacle fighter with an interesting and indepth lore to boot its hard to fault warframe for what it offers and the price it offers it for free there is however something to note warframe features a cash shop that allows you buy anything within the game for platinum your platinum account is charged by real world money and doing so gives you a huge boost within the game i want to stress though that everything every single item can be gained in game without the use of platinum to do so though makes the game a massive grind starting solo and venturing into the game for the first time my personal experience was that this game truly comes close to forcing you to have to pay for some item to break up the norm of running the same mission over and over again in order to gain new weapon upgrades before spending any money on the game i was on my way to gaining my prime warframe but purchasing a pack of platinum surpassed all build times item requirments and even allowed me to double my modification slots a great free game that becomes grounded by a borderline questionable payment methods if you can deal with the occasional grind its well worth it and i can totally deal with the grind
recommended
the only downside to this game is that there is no open world or even sandbox type environment to expand immersion within the world in virtually every other aspect the game is a dreamlike playground for fans of games like mass effect unreal tournament or in some ways even prince of persia and ninja gaiden there is wall running handled in a well executed manner there is melee combat complete with actual combos and timing as well as blocking there is evil space creatures and factions to kill and hate and there is a huge array of both weapons and warframes to choose from and collect in order to diversify your experience even recently a new system of flight combat was added straight out of a space shooter sim hybrid while it is true the game is very light on story line or explanation and can become quite grindy after a deep binge of obsessive exposure the core systems of the game are bieng constantly improved and there is no pay 2 win mechanic because anything you can acquire through the shop except for a very few cosmetics are all obtainable in game pvp players be warned however this game is not about pvp at all and the pvp aspect of the game is not very well realized or implemented at this point while pvp is playable it is certainly not for everyone and is not what the game is focused around at all

a fantastic game that would be universes better with far far far more variety in its environments and objectives
recommended
i started playing this game way back when it first hit steam and let me tell you there wasnt much to be had there it was a great concept and didnt seem like anything more than a coop thing come into the last year or so and this game has made amazing progress and the fact that practically this game is 100% free given the fact you can trade items for platinum game credits to which you can use to speed up timers buy those aesthetic items or bluerints you dont have to actually spend money for this game but i can almost guarantee you will want to at some point warframe login rewards will occasionally reward you with a 50% off coupon  free plat on platinum purchases to help regulate plat flow in the markets and give you a taste of what platinum can do again platinum is not needed for everything as most things can be either farmed or bought with ingame money but some things will require plat either excluseively or to help expedite things the core gameplay is somewhat grindy as youll be running missions for dailies clearing planets to uncover new ones gathering materials to craft new gear or items or even gathering gear itself recently updates have changed how melee works and have also introduced clans and pvp future updates are told to bring actual space play involving jetpacks tldr try the game its free you could spend money if you wanted but its not needed for a current gen game that has online play free goals and objectives why not try it
recommended
just play this now 
recommended
very nice game
recommended
first of all this game somehow doesnt feel like a grind you can get most of the weaponsframes pretty quickthe community are awesome mostly in the north americaneu servers like help newbies etc the stealth is just to simple and weakgunplay is fun with many ways to take out your enemiesfrom your oridnary guns to lazors beams to enegry weapons etc each frame looks and funtions uniquelythere are so many ways to kill your enemieswill you slash dash your way through your enemies will you zap them into oblivion and many morealso you can earn real life currency platnium though trading rare stuffs prime partsmodsstuff p arcwing is awesome as you fly around space and blast your way though victory but there not much really to play arcwing as there are very little weaponsmods for itthere are syndicates you can fight for that gives you rewards of doing missions got themthough a little more lore can be added to why and how they were created so at least i could give a damn about why im helping the syndicates rather than focusing on the rewardsoverall this game is fun but it is very repetitive though they have many game modesthey are feel the same at times
recommended
space ninjas space baddies space farming best farming simulator 2016 1110 would farm again in all seriousness though warframe is a third person coop shooter you play as the tenno who seek the protect the balance as i got into this game it was confusing unless you check the wiki 247 which i did because im a nerd that way you wont understand anything however once you get the hold of the mechanics the game is really fun however the grinding and the cruel rng does make this game feel repetitive time after time when you do get burned out just do something else come back in a few months and even weeks and i garuntee you that something new has been addedchanged pros beautiful graphics fluid motion f2p completely everything is unlockable except for event items which could have been done for free and cosmetics a dev digital extremes that actively updates and cares about this game just fun cons repetitive at times confusing to the new player and yes de is human so they do make mistakes these mistakes are usually temporary and will be fixed almost immediately overall this game is fun and just pure awesome like any game it does have its cons but the pros heavily cover them up i recommend you pick it up and give it a go remember check the wiki 3
recommended
i have played this game since the day it has came out and personally i think its an amazing coop game if you get the chance download it and play with me

recommended
you should play it its free and you are a mothering ninja
recommended
alongside of being addicting and fast paced alongside of a stealth aspect being possible the game introduces a challenging and indepth grinding system that makes it a non paytowin game essentially a thirdperson destiny only free no complaints here
recommended
a fun game especially with friends its a bit boring at first since you have little gear but once you start leveling and collecting more it becomes hard to stop the game picks up at higher levels where enemies are more difficult overall a good game definitely worth playing
recommended
2 years of nonstop love for warframe ive been here since closed beta and have no plan on leaving unless pwe ruins it like they do to everything they touch i dislike you perfect world no one likes cash cows
recommended
i love everything about this game it is wonderful and addicting and fun
recommended
i love the fact that warframe is a social game unless youre kind of crazy most of the missions require a group to complete properly and random grouping is easy and friendly lots of people in the chat are willing to help out newbies and the community seems overall very friendly the game is beautiful with a sleek and clean spaceage aesthetic that is a lot of eye candy there really is a warframe for everyone with a variety of looks feels builds and abilities that are as fun as they are variable theres still a lot of small glitches here and there not being able to see the color of another players ship is a current one but nothing that impacts real gameplay so that is truly a nitpick more then a criticism overall if you love a fun flash and bash space ninja game this is really the one for you
recommended
had a good time with your friends
recommended
whatre you doing reading this its a good free to play game go get it
recommended
after starting warframe ive seen this game grow and change all for the better every so often they come out with another gamechanging update that will keep you hooked if youve played warframe when it was starting out and you havent been back to it you wouldnt be playing the same game at least youde beed help recognizing it now ill try to keep it short but here are the details i think you should know graphics amazing artwork nothing to laugh at here the visuals will not let you down and for those with nvidia graphic cards you even get extra effects that are exclusive to each character you play gameplay as of right now there are 22 characters or warframes to play as not including several prime counterparts there are 8 prime warframes 1 being unobtainable right now each warframe has 4 unique abilites that are unlocked as you level that warframe up the max level for them is 30 warframes benefit from adding mods which are randomly dropped from enemies they require mod capactity which a warframe gains as it levels up there are currently 993 mods in the game a warframe is made by crafting 3 pieces in the players foundry then crafting the warframe itself with the blueprints and all three pieces weapons are obtained in a similar manor however they vary greatly some weapons require parts and others require materials they too require mod capacity for any mods to be added the action of the game takes place in missions there are currently 16 missiontypes not all missions are necessary to complete however certain planets and nodes require certain missions to be completed there are 4 different factions the player will face not including pvp that require different strategies and builds to attack and survive damage types come into play here as well as knowing what enemies are good at and hot to counter it free to play platinum what is it platinum is the market currency players can buy as a free to play game warframe makes its money from this platinum can be bought from the store or traded for mods or prime parts whats it for platinum is used for buying coloring pallettes to better customize your weapons and warframes buy costmetic items buying equipmentwarframeweapons in the market youde otherwise have to make and for eliminating the crafting time of an item in the process of being made buying platinum is not necessary to get far in the game it can however speed things along greatly it is important to note that the beginning of the game doesnt leave you with much i recommend teaming up with friends if you have any already into warframe and if not taking your time and completing any of the starting missions to level up and find mods
recommended
this game tends to come to me in waves big ones i really like this game and with 1000 hours i can tell you its a grind
recommended
after 1 year warframe had evolved more than anyone would thought it did started off barely having any storylines and stale grinding still fun grinding now it had evolved to some rpg awesome love
recommended
you are a tenno an ancient warrior reawakened to a solar system in conflict the grineer a genetically deteriorated empire who use cloning fighting against the corpus a merchant cult with strong technology and weapons there is also the infested thrown in for good measure who through a sentient virus morphs living and robotic beings into hideous monstrosities warframe plays somewhat similar to left4dead you can go coop with up to four people starting off at one part of a randomly generated map and make your way through to fulfill a objective which can be exterminating all enemies defending a point defeating a boss or other such things and afterwards you reach the exit and finish the mission warframes are exoskeletons used by players they have unique looks stats and have 4 unique abilities each when you start off you only get to choose one of three but as you progress you can craft more to use there is also a wide range of weapons there are three different kinds you have equipped primary secondary melee these can include anything from your simple rifles shotguns handguns but can also include flamethrowers throwing knives bows and many other exotic weapons which you can craft you also level up your warframe and weapons which increases stats slightly and increases mod capacity mods are a very interesting mechanic to the game they modify your warframe and weapons and let you essentially minmax what you want it adds strategy to how you play the game then there is the important question that comes up with most f2p games is this pay to win can you only have fun or be as good as other people if you pay warframe is actually surprisingly fair with its microtransactions yes you can buy warframes or weapons on the market with actual cash but its very easy to just craft your own stuff during missions you get resources and blueprint drops which you use to craft stuff the only stuff you cant actually craft is cosmetic stuff and slots to carry more warframes and weapons but thankfully you can trade with other players for platinum which you can then use so you can very easily have a great time with warframe without needing spend a single cent
recommended
warframe play it for the ninjas not the story but still it is amazing game
recommended
very good but little hard to play in early
recommended
well theres not much to say about warframe its got a very very good f2p model and it ties that together in a very well rounded package of graphics and gameplay sure the devs might be aiming a bit high with the $200 package but for the standard person its got some good stuff going for it
recommended
its a good game and has improved quite a bit throughout the updates its an onoff game for me personally youll return to it eventually overall pretty fun whenever you get back into the game also youre a damn space ninja whats not to love
recommended
warframe has changed a great deal since i last played it the implementation of an actual tutorialintroduction to the universe the addition of quests and the redesign of doing stuff in menus between missions to walking around in your own spaceship and doing stuff between missions all serve to make the game feel far more immersive than it was two years ago the combat is still fun and fast paced with a wide variety of different warframes and weapons to choose from and master each with their own distinct abilites strengths and weaknesses however the games enviroments can get very repetitive after a while and the compelling nature of the game stems from grinding and collecting parts to build new warframesweaponsetc think diablo or torchlight rather than experiencing a deep story and compelling characters something which warframe is devoid of if you enjoy a good grindfest youll feel right at home if not then move along this isnt the game youre looking for
recommended
overall amazing ftp the combat is fun if a bit tiring at times but everything can be gained through relatively low amounts of work besides pure cosmetics the holiday events are fun and offer free cosmetics and large updates have been coming frequently to the game since it launched on steam if you like third person shooters youll probably like this game you can also check out some beginner tutorials on my channel as the full tutorial is still in development httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgq7yki1t8ra

the graphics r amazing for f2p
recommended
absolutely recommend for anyone that doesnt mind grinding through some of the slack space ninjas with powers is pretty fun all the same
recommended
warfarm and bugframe yet cool to play warning only play this game if you willing to devote your whole life to grinding and farming in this game

this game is pretty addictive and the graphics are amazing only downside is the microtransactions but thats expected in a freetoplay game

a wonderful and inventive action fourplayer coop tps and a welcome breath of fresh air in a gaming environment previously dominated by first person shooters and call of dutylikes fastpaced gunplay and creative parkourlike acrobatics coupled with alien and exotic character and creature design give warframe refreshing 3d gameplay and aestetics without overly gimmicky or cartoony elements sadly flow can easily be interrupted by gamebreaking bugs glitches and server errors that seem to double with each patch and game update and the game lacks many features one might expect in an mmo such as a trading system and auction house the game can also feel a bit grindy at times with the need to farm the same areas multiple times to complete an item in the games crafting system warframe is f2p and gets all its revenue from the ingame cash shop where you can purchase options to further customize your warframe items to boost your abilities and new weapons and warframes thankfully all items in the cash shop are also available in game through mission so the game has adopted a paytogrindless system despite the many flaws of the game which is still in open beta warframe is a promising new game i would highly reccomend for anyone looking for a new and unique style of play with their friends there are opportunities for both the hardcore numbercruncher and the casual gamer and these arent mutually exclusive the wide variety of warframes weapons and abilities available to the player make warframe a highly customizable and genuinely enjoyable experience for actionloves of all types and honestly who doesnt want to wallrun across a room chop a robots head off and then burn his buddy alive with your mind space ninjas

a very grindy game but otherwise fun if you can deal with it over 20 unique warframes tons of weapons ranging from a simple automatic or a simple shotgun to something as crazy as a jetfueled mace if you can deal with a ton of grinding this game is pretty good

ing amazing game by far the best f2p game on steam so far
recommended
is one of the best free games heres an action free to play you have like too
recommended
great game do missions fight down bosses youre pretty much a living killing machine d

the bow is cool i guess so is the game
recommended
its a really fun freetoplay type game where you can unlock everything for free if you have the time and patience to do so or you can support the game by buying it now not a big fan of pay 2 win games but i dont really mind if you have some time off i recommend this game to play with a friend or three and do some missions andor some defense missions to level up faster also remember to press g to mark moudels and stuff like that 
recommended
diablo  mass effect  space ninjas theme  warframe

this is really an awesome game  you can say that it is top f2p game for now 
recommended
excellent game literally the definition of immersive if you dont have this i have one question why not

if you like shooting slashing and dashing your way to victory then this is your game
recommended
its got a lot of grinding from where i stand but grinding isnt so bad when youre being a space ninja slashing and gunning down enemies and soaring through space like a oneman army of death addictive could very well be an understatement about this game
recommended
if you like futuristic games then this game is for you its awsome
recommended
this game brings the gameplay style of mass effect 3 multiplayer into a new set of worlds with much more comprehensive missions and hundreds more weapons ive been addicted to this game since i first layed eyes upon it join up and fight

i had a review before but i felt like its time to completely redo it now that i am more experienced so we have warframe what is warframe you are a tenno basically a space ninjasamuraithing and you have to restore balance to the galaxy by that you go around killing different factions gathering their resources to build more weapons to kill them all again its a loop and if you dont like the gameplay or grinding than this game has nothing for you there is a tiny amount of story but the game revolves around gameplay heavily so what are the three factions grineer an empire of cloned soldiers who are genetically decaying and who youll probably be fighting the most they are heavily armored and prefer brute force corpus a conglomerate of merchants who do whatever they can for a profit they have armored helmets but are mostly lightly armored and they prefer to use robots and other tricks infested space zombies they are infected by a virus from an old war and kill whatever gets in their way they are lightly armored and usually swarm you there are also the orokin but they just take some units from all three factions and combine them all which youll be facing in the orokin towers where youll be spending most of the endgame there are also a multitude of weapons some of them are better than others for example the soma and the soma prime spew crits like crazy the boltor prime does pure damage and the latron prime is very accurate and very ammo efficient there are constant wars over which is better but it usually boils down to personal preferance modding can be a bit tricky to get used too but there are builds online and its not too hard to learn there are also warframes which is basically your class they al lhave different stats health shield armor movement speed and others and different powers which reflect what their based of necromancer assassin paladin etc they take a while to farm and 3 days to craft but some completely change your playstyle compared to others so what about the gameplay as you are a space ninja thing you have a large amount of abillities which include wallrunning rolling lots of melle attacks wallrunning and shooting sliding sliding and shooting slide melee attacks and some others you use all your abillities weapons and powers along with three other tenno to run around maps and kill everyone in sight youve probably also seen it was free to play so youre wondering is this game pay2play well my answer is a complete no th eonly things you can get with only the premium currency platinum are cosmetic items and you can get platinum from trading so anything is available with dedication all the game changing items are available for free the community is great aside from some heated arguments boltor prime vs soma prime they answer questions are generally polite and if you need help with a quest want to do a tower etc ask in recruting chat and they will probably help so this game all boils down to personal preference do you prefer the combat play it do you prefer grinding play it do you prefer a great story not the best game for you i personally love this game and i recommend you give it a try if you dont like it no money lost if you love it you are going to be spending lots of time on it ive almost spent 400 hours and that pales in comparison to some of my friends

ive been playing this game since closed beta aand its come a long way with very few flaws this is my favorite game of all time why because its free the graphics are stunningthe environment is beatiful and minor pay 2 win engine even though i waisted more than 150$ on this gamedont judge meoverall its a very well and thought out game it is difficult but if u put some time in it youll be quite the master space ninja you always wanted to be as a kid updates are always something spectaceclur even small updates like hotfixes or some more enemies can change the game a lot like for example update 14 and 15 those where hude updates that brought more than 100000 people back into the action so my rating for this game my ok my not igns 10101

the base gameplay of shoot mans is pretty damn solid and the devs are incredibly quick at releasing new content since the game was in closed beta it has become much much better and very different the devs even have some more massive gameplay changes coming that sound badass the only problem id say this game has is that they dont balance some things very well which isnt too big of a deal since its a coop game and not competative and the catalystreactor upgrade system also not too big of a deal but can be annoying in short the base gameplay is a blast and the devs are incredible at keeping it updated and fresh

when i first downloaded this game my first thought was this game you cannot solo and act like rocky however as i progressed on through the game and got better frames and weapons & just in general better experience with the game i soon realised with the right setup you can solo anything if you put your mind to it i loved this game so much that i spent 95 on the loki prime acess package soon after that i bought 5 kubrows and probably spent around 550platinum on them soon after that i stopped playing and left all my beloved kubrows in stasis where they would be safe this was before they added consign to lotus ability 34 months later i came back to this game to find that 56 of my kubrows which i spent platinum on had been removed so i had been left with 1 fully grown one and 4 other baby ones none of which i payed plat for  so i contacted the support about this issue and they deleted the logs of me ever owning those kubrows and ever spending platinum on them they deleted the kubrows and said there are no logs of me owning any kubrows this made me stop playing the game which i loved and spent so much of my money on ps i am 16 going on 17 and do not have any income so nearly 100 is a lot for me this game has a great community and this is why i keep coming back to it and enjoy playing it it improves a lot and as the game improves it adds new challenges for you to conquer with your friends if you are lucky you can join an already made clan i wouldnt suggest starting your own clan as it costs a lot of items to make a decent dojo  but if you join a pre made clan and theyre active and kind and they help you out with missions and stuff then stick around until you improve and help some of their new members out the clans on here are really fun to be apart of as they are able to attack a sector on the solor system and it brings you to a fight with the current clanalliance owning it ps de are money grabbing s pick this game up at all costs and play it but please make sure if you purchase anything on this game with real money make sure you will receive the items you buy ingame with the platinum which you get

after playing this game for almost 2 years for over a 1000 hours i can safely say that its a lot of fun if you dont plan to play it for long as a free to play player ok dont get me wrong you can get everything a paid user can get with literally no exceptions thanks to the trading system you can trade paid currency and many in game item blueprints and mods as you like this allows free to play users to earn paid currency however if youre going this route expect to farm 247 for the rest of your life im one of the founders of this game and i own the highest prime access pack which give the highest value for money paid currency yet i still havent managed to 100% this over all my hours of playtime good news though unless youre a crazy collector like me youll never have to you can easily get proper gear you like within a week or two of playing i cannot stress enough how much care and love was put into this game the updates are more frequent than iv seen in any game ever adding a bunch of new mapswarframesgunscosmetics and a ton of other stuff it is the most space ninja game youre gonna get with an  ing ton of content i recommend this game to its fullest it has its flaws obviously it can be pretty buggy at times but thats to be expected with constant updates thankfully the bugs are dealt with rapidly but new ones will still come around it is pretty grindy in its nature and there are timewalls on crafting but they are no problem whatsoever once you have sated your lust for your first gear what i do not recommend however is buying weapons or warframes directly from the in game store the prices are really high and theyre that way on purpose youre really intended to craft them thats how i got 95% of my gear however if you are into costumizing your looks well youre in luck the prices for cosmetics in this game are very resonable and with the daily chance to get a 25%  50% or 75% discount on the paid currency you can end up with a ton for dirt cheap warframe the space ninja simulator recommended

in the past one year there has only been one game that has kept my attention span for over 200 hours of play time and that is warframe as of the date of this review they just added a week ago a player driven economy and politics system which makes the map of the solar system dynamic nuff said

i could get into this game if the melee attacks was not so stiffsheeshi have to spin the view around 4 times before i can kill something lack of a lock on feature in a fast paced game is also a dissapointment
recommended
even though some people may complain about this game for its excessive grind or the need to pay money at its core its a fun space ninja shooter instead of having the take cover against the enemies they have to take cover against you my only complaint about this game would be the excessive grind in some areas and the seemingly neverending cycle of patch introduce more bugs patch again 7510
recommended
ive been playing warframe for quite some time and its by far one of my favorite games it has the feeling of a fast pace shooter game but with a unique feeling of individual player abilities and customization amazing graphics and decent community with the different mission types and hundreds of weapons theres always something to do
recommended
its a good game
recommended
for free this game is really good thats all im saying
recommended
this game was awesomness but its too hard for playing single player
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played d

pretty fun game ive spent hours playing it on my laptop

its rly fun to play and for a free game it has a lot of graphics p
recommended
mixed opinion on this the gameplay is great with the wall running the brilliant animations and the series of characters you can play with that all have their own abilities however the developers have used a tile system so after a while the maps get repetitive and they all look the same that said the enemies are also reused and the only change is their lvl scaling this game is mostly for those who have nothing theyd rather be doing and just want to stab things with a sharp discus and shoot an arrow into something with a helmet 5 times bigger than the actual headseriously knock off the grinners head & helmet and the head is actually a regular sized head
recommended
one description of the game grindy another description epic
recommended
played quite a while back and it was an awesome game back then havent even finished reinstalling it and i know i can easily recommend it hands down one of the best f2p games out there with a lot of replayability
recommended
as an oldbro and as a tenno i say go and play warframe sure it has problems sure the playerbase knows nothing better but to run around with boltor primes guns blazing sure half the time youre online you go and farm xp in draco but you see warframe makes you powerful it makes you feel powerful hell it even gives you three warframes with strange protrusions and a stance that erm you understand so go and play warframe youll see the way
recommended
to anyone who never played warframe yet  here is a clear review for you from someone who played over 200 hours  note  this may be long review but it will give you the information you need  this game is worth playing and its a great game to try for a lot of reasons  1 this is not a pay2win game  you can almost have everything in it by grinding and crafting  i have some rare gear and frames in game and i didnt pay anything  2this not just a shooting game  you can run on walls  climb high places and even do stealth kills and avoid alarms if you get spotted you can stop the alarm too  3frequent updates and bug fixes  nice events to join in and get a prizes sometimes  4nice support team that will reply to your complaints and try to solve your issues 5very nice community and helpful players  its rarely to find a rude player or a troll  6this game has no hackers or cheaters so far from my perspective 7you can trade some stuff you find with platinumingame currency with other players  regardless of this games positive things  there is some negatives that may annoy you  1this game has a lot of bugs  even with updates and fixes  sometimes new bugs occur with the new update and fixes for old bugs  2grinding and collecting resources may become very frustrating and make you feel that the gameplay is so repetitive  specially if you are farming for a rare recourse and you need like 10  the chance of getting 1 of this resource vary by your luck  if you are not lucky you may replay the same mission 4 times for just 110 of it  3game is very challenging and somehow hard for new players whose their rank is still low it will be very hard to play solo and you will always need squads until you have better framesweapons  4even with all the great thing in this game and you can almost get everything in it for free  there is still some limitations that forces you to buy   for example if you want a bigger inventory for frames or weapons yes you will surely need a much bigger inventory for everything which dissapoints me as a warframe player 5buying platinumingame currency somehow expensive and you will feel ripped of   like for 20$ you can get like 175 plat  if you want to buy a weapone from market or a ready crafted frame it will cost you 225  plat  2 inventory slots cost 12 plat  1 warframe slot will cost 20  so you will need to spend a lot for little upgrades in the game one last note  despite of the negative side of this game  i totally recommend this game  its a great experience and you will enjoy it besides its still beta so bugs will be fixed soon  i will wait for you in the field fellow tenno

wow well where to start warframe is just brilliant the best free to play game on steamnot counting tf2 because that was paid at one point the concept itself is just so tempting youre a space ninja who beats up robots ugly guys and sometimes space zombies the graphics and art style fit the game perfectly it has a great combat system large selection of weapons and a vast amount of mods you can apply to make your weapon suit whatever roll you need and each warframe has its own abilities and they are awesome they range from distractions teleporting freezing poisoning creating black holes clearing a room in a single stomp or even punching your enemies very soul out of their body theres just too much to talk about at once itd make your head spin great and helpful community and an awesome dev team who just work on this game because they love to the only money they get really is from people who pay for ingame currency platinum this is where most f2p games fail free to play but pay to win this is not the case everything you see can be obtained without pumping any money at all into your warframe account want a new gun buy a blueprint and get the resources most of the time it isnt even that hard to grind for them tho warframes can take wuite a long time to obtain without money its so much more fun and rewarding doing it manually what cant be bought from blueprints are available via random events seriously if you havnt played this game just go get this now its badass its fun its free you have nothing to loose except countless hours p

this is a game ive been playing consistently for over a year now the development team communicates with the community extremely well and they do massive updates every 23 months the gameplay is solid it looks great and is a great coop game to play through
recommended
the overall gameplay and features are wonderful in this game a really well developed masterpiece some of the things that really catch my attention and hopefully yours ive listed below please try the game to see if you like it everyone is different  free to play  paying wont give you an advantage over other players it will only reduce waiting times to build items unlock skins and colors pallets and other cosmetics everything that is not cosmetic you can obtain from playing the game  free content  the game is constaly updated with new content  weapons warframes maps and game modes  events  there a multiple events in this game from which you can experience alternating goals  weapon modifications  modify the damage fire rate add elemental type damage reload speed recoil control appearancecolor etc  warframe modifications  run speed health shield maximum energy ability damage ability radiusreach appearancecolor  up to 4 player online mulitplayer  cooperative or deathmatch arena  bosses  tiny to huge deadly and tactical these bosses know how to get under your skin when you beat them youll find good rewards  voice chat optional  dont stop to type in deadly situations that require coordination just talk using a microphone alternatively you can use the voice chat to chill have some beers and talk about nonesense  large player base  never feel alone in your region theres always some people online that want to do what you want to do most of the players are also nice and they dont undermine anyone because of the shared common goals  repetition  sometimes it will get too repetitive so have another game you alternate between  new hud  feels weird to some may take time to get used to

basically you are a futuristic ninja in space why would you not play this game

one of the great f2p games out there  not p2w at all  everything can be earned with ingame cashitems 
recommended
this game is space ninja themed tps it has parkour moves guns and fun abilities it has nice visuals even on a low end pc and even the visual design is good it is a little bit grindy and repetative but if you like the theme you wont mind it its not pay to win its only pay to spare your time but then you get left out of the fun the only drawback for this game is the bugs when old bugs get patched new ones appear so if you havent played a buggy game for a long time this one is not for you but most players can live with the games bugs bec they are usually not annoying
recommended
good game but somewhat buggy

great game

fun shooter version of diablo digital extremes is good about updates and listens to the community 810 though the game is still in beta written as of update 12

its got a lot of grinding from where i stand but grinding isnt so bad when youre being a space ninja slashing and gunning down enemies and soaring through space like a oneman army of death addictive could very well be an understatement about this game

the first 5 hours were pretty horrific you go in the combat feels slow everything that cost rl money seems to expensive then you start fighting in groups you start realizing the training wheels are off you start realizing how you can build your own play style you realize that the cash shop stuff is a shortcut you really dont need to take and that simply playing the game and evolving your strategies as you go depending on your mission and frames is fun and rewarding pros menus your ship is the menu it is gorgeous insane customization of stats and builds and weapons community of people who statistically welcome encourage and teach gorgeous graphics when everything is cranked to max cash shop isnt needed to progress or enjoy a thing mowing down waves of enemies that arent too bright is pretty relaxing and fun new warframes at lvl 30 really bring about different ways of playing cons rng the endgame gear is all about grinding out challenging but repetitive missions for the low % chance of the items you actually need appearing certain aspects just arent finished archwing its meleegun star fox but gorgeous which can leave certain modesareas feeling shallow pc controls for wall runningjumping rather clunky for a space ninja simulator stealth its not a working system in the game its rather frustrating and slow to try and only stealth through a level the current system isnt built for it is it the best overall game youve played no is it fun to relax after work and mow down hordes with your friends yes

ive already done a full review elsewhere httpsk986terminalsquarespacecomk986games201366warframe but the main thing to know here is that it is a good substitute for the me3 multiplayer if you dont have it for pc the dev team is constantly working to upgrade and make their game better all the while trying to listen to the huge slurry of player responses and generate new content at the same time as a f2p its one of the more effective layouts ive seen  as you can earn everything except slots to put things in entirely just by spending the time to grindfarmluck it out the pricing seems to be a bit steep as is most f2p games out there but its also not unreasonable considering the charges are essentially just there to replace the time investment on most items lots of unique classes in the warframes lots of different weapons an ongoing beta that has resulted in numerous fundamental systems being overhauled in one way shape or form  its worth a try at the very least  even more so if you play with friends
recommended
this game is fun amazingly so but it has its cons too one of the facts that i love so much about this game is that most of the features are really unique like you can buy a lot of stuff for platinum premium credits but you can get platinum without having to spend a cent got a rare mod or items sell them in the trading section for platinum that you can use and trade however you wish the leveling system is fun as well there are 2 types of levels weapon and character levels and there are also mastery ranks basically the difference is that mastery rank can only climb in xp there are 17 of them and each more different than the last but how you get xp is unique as well you get 100 mastery xp from leveling up your weapon and 200 for leveling up your warframe and when you have enough for a level up you face a master rank challenge that differs each time first killing with primary weapon within time limit then kill with secondary then with melee then here come the fun part the fourth is hacking consoles withing the time limit it is a sort of minigame within the game you can do to reset alerts the the fifth is sharpshooting shooting assigned targets within the time limit weapons level ups dont make you weapon stronger but it gives 1 mod capacity per level at the maximum of 30 levels but you can use a orokin catalyst or a orokin reactor to double the mod capacity to 60 in game term this is called poatoing due to the shape of them changing your mods can drastically improve you weapons from adding elemental damage to increasing damage to adding clip size total amunition or increasing fire rate the mods for warframes are different they give plus shield capacity plus health and buffs such as those but also they can give things such as loot and enemy radars make a shockwave from your feet when you jump from high up and land but also the adition of aura mods are available for warframes and melee weapons aura mods give extra mod capicity and grants you bonuses such as energy regen or health regen some give gun damage or extra health or extra ammo polarities are basically types of mods if you match a mod polarity with a weapon or a warframe polarity it only costs half if you mismatch the polarities it costs 1 or 2 more aura mods give double plus in mod capicity if matched with the right polarity forma you can use on max level weapons or frames to reset their level to level 0 but it does not make it any more powerful instead you can alter one slot to what ever polarity you want making you ale to fit more powerful mods on it now enough of this pros lets talk cons this game is glitchy and sometimes has poor ai i have seen it time and time again where an enemy is hiding behind a wall and wont do anything unless you are standing in their faces this game is unbelievably grindy when you have played it much even as little as i have you start to have a plethora of resources i have like 60000 of everything common that drops in packages of 200300 and i have up to 150 of the rarest resources the game counters that with argon crystals to get argon crystals you must first grind for a key that randomly drops in survival or defence misions then you must do the mission the key opens and hope you get an extra rare resource i have done 4 of these missions with loot radar and not get 1 of them so finally you got an argon crystal but surprise it disappears from your inventory after 24 hours and some require to have 3 of these things so for the most powerful and most grindy weapon out there the dragon nikana you had to farm for 75 oxium which you could only get by defeating specific flying enemies called oxium osprey oh and here is the catch if you shoot them they suicide bomb you and you get no drops try to use melee and they fly away so after weeks of grinding for oxium you need to have 1 forma as well forma blueprints are found as a login reward or in special alert missions and making it takes 1 of every ultra rare resource morphics gallium neural sensors and 24 hours to wait oh and did i mention the 3 argon crystal that are required as well so finally you got your nikana but to upgrade that to the dragon nikana you need to have 1 argon crystal another 75 oxium and the mastery rank of 8 that takes a long time so you can grind and grind and grind for hours but you cant keep using your same weapons or else you wont get any mastery rank ups i didnt figure this out so i spent 70 hours without switching weapons so i am only in mastery rank 6 now
recommended
this review is split into sections using numerals to show each section my rating all in all i would rate it an 810 would recommend if you can deal with a decent amount of grinding and some bugs also this game is still in beta i the game modes are exterminate eliminate all enemies mobile defense taking a datamass to a control panel then defending it defense defending something for 5 waves at a time survival survive a mass onslaught of enemies for as long as possible rewards every 10 minutes excavate defend and keep a scanner and its excavators powered to extract resources interception you capture and defend several points from being taken over by enemies sabotage destroy a reactor assassinate all boss missions and to kill high valued targets and hijack defend a mobile target and possibly destroy it the game is 100% coop unless you go to the pvp player versus player areas graphics are good gameplay is very grindy sometimes buggy and very well balanced bugs well crap ii the game is grind worthy grinding through many missions to progress is slightly boring but considering that each mission is never the same in the sense that they will always look different from the last time you played it all weapons can be op if you mod then properly and you obtain mods from trading other players rewards from missions or by defeating enemies there are warframes which is basically your suit with magical powers that are very destructive against enemies there are 300ish missions and more than 10 different planetsmoons with 10 or more missions each with their matching environmental art styles each warframe has their own special four abilities unique to that warframe warframes abilities range from being able to turn invisible to being able to stomp the ground and suspend all the enemies in the air to shooting spikes into every enemy within your sights the weapons in game can range from a jet power hammer to a pistol that shoots rockets to a gun that shoots circular blades or bolts the lore is very simple and easy to remember there are three main factions the grineer that are a bunch of brain washed clones the corpus that probably are like humans and the infested that are infested creatures of doom there is an enemy called the stalker that rarely shows up if a boss curses you and then there are the g3 and zanuka that do the same thing you have these syndicates that are 6 different groups you sign up with one and then you trade this thing called standing for a mod that boosts your warframes abilities or a weapon or something else the basic 300 missions are the normal missions then there are void missions and derelict missions void missions come in 4 tiers each increasing tier number indicates increasing difficulty there is a void boss called corrupted vor he comes around just as rarely as the stalker does but only in the void derelict are basically the tier 3 and 4 but only with infested enemies also customization of your warframeweapons is pretty good you can change every color to whatever you want and same for additional cosmetics credits are the basic currency in the game orokin ducats are prime pieces rewards from void missions traded for special currency to be traded for primed modscosmetics and the premium currency platinum platinum can be earned by the login rewards by trading rare modsprime components or by purchasing them archwing i have not done too much of this yet as such i am unable to give 100% valid information afaik as far as i know you have a jetpack and fly through space and continue your basic objectives and you can go fast just like sonic the hedgehog this is mainly unfinished structure added into the game there have been several alerts in game using this game type but it remains with little content iii alerts one of the best ways of acquiring rare modsitems is through dailyspecial alerts there are daily alerts that often reward with only credits or a few resources but sometimes they have a rare mod or weapon as a reward sometimes rare resources normally a weapon or some high cost item would be reward from a tactical alert rarely some type of cosmetic items tactical alerts are long and tedious alerts that last a week or so in which the player needs to complete a very hard challenge in order to obtain said items the tactical alerts are mainly for experienced players who are looking for challenge iv raids raids are very hard in my opinion much more difficult than tactical alerts they offer a rare arcane item and require a massive amount of teamwork there currently is only one raid in the game it has several team based puzzleschallenges which works well with 8 player squads in the end you face off a very easy to kill boss as long as you dont die my rating all in all i would rate it an 810 would recommend if you can deal with much grindingsome bugs absolute nonsense

warframe has changed a great deal since i last played it the implementation of an actual tutorialintroduction to the universe the addition of quests and the redesign of doing stuff in menus between missions to walking around in your own spaceship and doing stuff between missions all serve to make the game feel far more immersive than it was two years ago the combat is still fun and fast paced with a wide variety of different warframes and weapons to choose from and master each with their own distinct abilites strengths and weaknesses however the games enviroments can get very repetitive after a while and the compelling nature of the game stems from grinding and collecting parts to build new warframesweaponsetc think diablo or torchlight rather than experiencing a deep story and compelling characters something which warframe is devoid of if you enjoy a good grindfest youll feel right at home if not then move along this isnt the game youre looking for

overall amazing ftp the combat is fun if a bit tiring at times but everything can be gained through relatively low amounts of work besides pure cosmetics the holiday events are fun and offer free cosmetics and large updates have been coming frequently to the game since it launched on steam if you like third person shooters youll probably like this game you can also check out some beginner tutorials on my channel as the full tutorial is still in development httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgq7yki1t8ra

absolutely recommend for anyone that doesnt mind grinding through some of the slack space ninjas with powers is pretty fun all the same

fantastic but if it has first person mode this will make me crazy

this game is great game i like it

warframe is not a player friendly game but if you have a friend who is already experienced with the game or you can just read 1 or 2 guides you will be fine but overal warframe is very fun if you wanna be a freking space ninja and murder fools with all maner of weapons and super powers

awsome

very addicting in the beginning seems like the new warframes are paytowin which kind of turned me off

this years installment of tony hawks pro skater has taken a surprising turn adding ninjas in space and neat missions whilst keeping all of the coop joy we all know and love no for real though dont let the metascore fool you this is a very solid game with dedicated developers and the first f2p game that hasnt infuriated me with pay2win  everything ingame that isnt discontinued can be aquired without spending a single shekel and it is very doable to get expensive stuff from the market within a day by grinding for stuff and then selling said stuff on the trade chat not that there is a point to that since the best items arent even in the market tldr this game is paynot2grindasmuch if youre really lazy and its a great coop game thats quickly turning into one of my favourites

the best online multiplayer game i have played to date if you havent played this you are missing out on a lot try it out

the best grinding game ever

first and foremost warframe is a fastpaced thirdperson freetoplay shooter that is set thousands of years in the future so it does have a big scifi element to it there is a focus on cooperative gameplay but it is viable to play alone and with the recent pvp revamp coop isnt the only thing to do freetoplay may scare some people off but i have to say this is a game that does it right microtransactions do exist but everything in the game can be earned through playing the game albeit at a slower pace than simply buying it outright before i would say the only exception to this would be inventory slots and cosmetics but since trading was introduced those exceptions quickly disappeared leaving the system a true payforconvenience one instead of a paytowin one the gameplay is fast fluid sometimes a little choatic and easy to learn yet has some depth to it the movement system itself will be changing soon but at the moment it is also easy to learn except for a couple of mechanics that arent immediately apparent such as coptering and wallflinging but these are things that are picked up quickly as you learn theres a lot of customization in the game as well allowing you to choose from a variety of different warframes weapons and companions as well as how they look on top of that you can tweak their effectiveness through the use of the mod card system allowing for quite a few different playstyles the game isnt without its issues though such as parts of the grind the tutorial and the state of endgame as a freetoplay game it does have grind so if youre the kind that hates grinding you may be turned away by this and yes since its all rng it can be terrible at times but it isnt on par with the kind of grinding you would see in korean rpgs the tutorial is rather long and drawnout and leaves some things unexplained or arent explained very well i recommend asking around for help in the first relay social hubs or looking at the warframe wiki [warframewikiacom] for anything you need to know while region chat should be left as a last resort endgame is probably warframes weakest point as its either collecting everything or going for as long as you can in endless missions while waiting for the next event to pop up but with the addition of raids and pvp those are probably going to become a part of it as well for the better since there isnt a real defined endgame youre free to make your own of course that is all my own opinion all in all warframe is a fun freetoplay third person shooter that has eaten up more than a lot of my time and i recommend at least giving it a try what is there to lose its free

absolutely love this game still anything can be good by adding space ninjas am i right

so this a game you grind inalotlike no really alot just getting that out of the way now plot wisethe story is still developing and gets quests that add to it when updates come outthis isnt that great to meit looks like it could have amazing lore once it gets fleshed out and established the crafting in this game is where the grind comes fromwhere i can see that being off putting its the best thing really cause that makes it so you dont have to pay for in game items at all unless you want to do so to get them faster the combat in this game is fast paced and feels very smoothwith alot of differing loadouts it never really gets boringbut you have to put in time to get everything which does take alot of timeagain like alot they do keep changing the stats of weapons and warframes which is good and bad cause it can make something you put alot of work intojust terribleacrid there is alot of types of missions you can do and 2 different combat typesnormal and archwing in the normal modes its just you in your warframe doing the different mission types and in archwing you do missions in space using thruster wingshard to explain exactly the graphics are nice and flashysometimes a little to shiny for me but everything does have its own style and feelthe level layouts do repeat and feel mundane after awhile but i only really felt that way doing stuff solowith people you dont even notice now the only thing you have to pay for is inventory slotsfor warframesweaponssentinels and kubrows this is honestly kinda crappy to me but its not the worst the dont cost much and you can get coupons for 25 50 or 75% off the in game currency called platnuim all in alli like this game and reccomend people to try it and see if they mind grindingbut again if you like this gameyou are gonna need to put a little money into it
recommended
if you want pure action and you like ninjas this is your game

slow preogession good graphics almost always wants u to buy stuff good multiplayerco op needs first person its like a 76 out of 10 you need to pull thru for baout 15 hours before u get anything good
recommended
its a great game with interesting mechanics a free to play game that you can have every thing and dont pay a cent and last look at my hours to create an opinion
recommended
im gonna start off by saying i have always been horrid at shooter games so i was hesitant to try this out a friend plays it extensively so i thought id give it a go and i am hooked this game is so much fun the missions the weapons the companions the frames i have fun just collecting things and leveling them i play quite a bit with public matchmaking and i have yet to find a negative person the community overall is very helpful and patient with beginners also i love the fact that you can get just about everything in game that you can spending cash to purchase platinum and buy items outright i dont feel this is a paytowin sort of game which is refreshing i highly recommend this game ^_^

this game is super fun they are always adding new content so you never get bored
recommended
this game is meant for those who like quick combat as well as hack & slash games especially for looters as well since this game will make you sooo hapy to build something new and add it into your inventory and then begin to test it out immediately as you obtained it this game is truly a masterpiece in its own way artstyle gameplay atmosphere etc
recommended
amazing graphics for a f2p game completely f2p dont need to buy anything to be successful in the game f2p players can rival against a p2p player the only difference is that p2p get their items faster than f2ps but in the long run f2p players will benefit more since they did not spend a penny and can rival a p2p player who can spend up to hundreds of dollars this game is about grinding for items or even platinumpremium currency you can get platinum through trading but sadly not everything is tradable this can is fun but sadly it is not for everyone this game requires a lot of grinding in order to do well and for people who dont like to do these boring stuff this game is not for you this game requires time and effort to do well ingame materials take a long time to grind for and for credits it is always not enoughfor newer players for those who have played for months or even years will definitely not find credits to be much of a problem since they have the general knowledge to know the best places to farmoften very high level which is why newer players will have a shortage of credits overall a great game with excellent graphics and gameplay however grinding is the main essence of this game

really really amazing game i have almost 500h of gameplay this game is a blend of mass effect 3 multiplayer with the grinding system of diablo borderlands etc

another free to play ill admit this isnt the best of games but its a fun game to play for a couple of hours every now and then lots of weapons and upgrades but unfortunately youll have to pay some money if you want the really good stuff all in all its fun but very very buggy full of glitches but the constant updates are working on fixing this game up time will tell how thisll turn up
recommended
all i have to say is ninjas in spaaacceeee the american servers are a bit slow so be patient other than that i give it 7 outta 10
recommended
after playing for a ridiculous amount of time ive concluded that its probably one of the most engaging games i have played
recommended
i thought this game was cool back when i first played it in closed beta forever ago just started playing it in earnest this week and i have to say its alot of fun more so when i played it originally it takes some work to get into and figure everything out but the tutorials are pretty helpful for modding and such
recommended
a great game became better with a newly introduced story line and quests its a difficult grind to get the better gear if you dont spend cash for platinum or purchase packs but its still possible to get all highend gear ingame without spending money a great time sink the game gets better and better as you put more and more time into it
recommended
best game ever  there are space ninjas in it 1110
recommended
you are a space ninja thats right space ninja> do i even need to explain anything else space ninja
recommended
after playing this game for over a year i have come to the conclusion that it is highly addictive and has the potential to be something great the combat is really fun from being a stealthy and fast loki to a tank like the rhino there is a warframe to suit everyone pros the game itself can be played without spending a single cent the combat is fun and can range in difficulty to easy to impossibly frustrating the middle game and endgame content keeps you playing and once you figure out how to actually play the game and how the systems work it become easy to play however higher level missions are best done in groups the maximum level difficulty that is possible to solo without dying would probably be 20 until you get endgame level gear participating in a clanalliance is almost necessary during the endgame but it is easy to either form your own or join an existing one new game content is almost added providing new things to do in the game so unless you are a veteran you will always have something to do cons the game is not easy to pick up the farming is almost unbearable as time goes on the early game is almost unbearable and the late game is rather stagnant even with the additions of pvp and clanalliance conflicts once you get to the end all that is left to do is grind the same content over and over again although the same content is entertaining you will find yourself taking long breaks from the game in order to make it feel fresh again i personally just started playing again after 7 months of not playing and i am enjoying the latest update on a final note the platinum prices are ridiculous and the artificial difficulty created by the low drop rates is clearly designed to keep you playing and paying
recommended
although the bugs may be a turn off i absolutely love this game constant updates large and small keep the game more varied and interesting the game alone may not seem to interesting but playing with friends is really fun the warframes vary well having different support offensive and defensive abilities also this is probably the best looking free to play around right now overall if you have the room to download give it a chance and play with friends and you will end up putting some hours into it
recommended
my favourite scifi game so far 1010 for me the graphics are beautiful the choice of weapons warframescharacters and modsto upgrade all these are just huge the game is mostly a coop game with a maximum of four players per mission your mission goals vary the environment varies everything is perfect only one thing i dont like the updates when a major update comes outlike new mission type new event etc there are so many bugs and glitches and sometimes a lots of game crashes that it makes almost impossible to play peacefully for one or two days they should focus on looking for these problems and repair them asap in brief this is a beautiful game interesting always gives you something new to reach i have 350 game hours and im still enjoying it
recommended

recommended
its a grinding game in essence with a somewhat bland storyline much like a lot of mmorpgs or online freetoplay games i personally enjoy playing it in moderation so that i dont tire of the grind and burn out the developers are quite active and fix bugs from new patches consistently new patches are released almost weekly with and major updates are monthly or bimonthly
recommended
while there are many things to brush up on this game by de they already have made this game a blast to play already not recommened for people who are not used to grind in online games but its doable for people wanting to play casually as someone coming from a 5 year playing ro i ensure u at the very least the grind is not as bad as it is there
recommended
when it was in beta i loves playing this game but unfortunately deleted it cuz it was getting tough to fight players who put money in the game irrespective of that fact the game is impresive and the game mechanics artwork is commendable

this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

when i first downloaded this game my first thought was this game you cannot solo and act like rocky however as i progressed on through the game and got better frames and weapons & just in general better experience with the game i soon realised with the right setup you can solo anything if you put your mind to it i loved this game so much that i spent 95 on the loki prime acess package soon after that i bought 5 kubrows and probably spent around 550platinum on them soon after that i stopped playing and left all my beloved kubrows in stasis where they would be safe this was before they added consign to lotus ability 34 months later i came back to this game to find that 56 of my kubrows which i spent platinum on had been removed so i had been left with 1 fully grown one and 4 other baby ones none of which i payed plat for  so i contacted the support about this issue and they deleted the logs of me ever owning those kubrows and ever spending platinum on them they deleted the kubrows and said there are no logs of me owning any kubrows this made me stop playing the game which i loved and spent so much of my money on ps i am 16 going on 17 and do not have any income so nearly 100 is a lot for me this game has a great community and this is why i keep coming back to it and enjoy playing it it improves a lot and as the game improves it adds new challenges for you to conquer with your friends if you are lucky you can join an already made clan i wouldnt suggest starting your own clan as it costs a lot of items to make a decent dojo  but if you join a pre made clan and theyre active and kind and they help you out with missions and stuff then stick around until you improve and help some of their new members out the clans on here are really fun to be apart of as they are able to attack a sector on the solor system and it brings you to a fight with the current clanalliance owning it ps de are money grabbing s pick this game up at all costs and play it but please make sure if you purchase anything on this game with real money make sure you will receive the items you buy ingame with the platinum which you get

after playing this game for almost 2 years for over a 1000 hours i can safely say that its a lot of fun if you dont plan to play it for long as a free to play player ok dont get me wrong you can get everything a paid user can get with literally no exceptions thanks to the trading system you can trade paid currency and many in game item blueprints and mods as you like this allows free to play users to earn paid currency however if youre going this route expect to farm 247 for the rest of your life im one of the founders of this game and i own the highest prime access pack which give the highest value for money paid currency yet i still havent managed to 100% this over all my hours of playtime good news though unless youre a crazy collector like me youll never have to you can easily get proper gear you like within a week or two of playing i cannot stress enough how much care and love was put into this game the updates are more frequent than iv seen in any game ever adding a bunch of new mapswarframesgunscosmetics and a ton of other stuff it is the most space ninja game youre gonna get with an  ing ton of content i recommend this game to its fullest it has its flaws obviously it can be pretty buggy at times but thats to be expected with constant updates thankfully the bugs are dealt with rapidly but new ones will still come around it is pretty grindy in its nature and there are timewalls on crafting but they are no problem whatsoever once you have sated your lust for your first gear what i do not recommend however is buying weapons or warframes directly from the in game store the prices are really high and theyre that way on purpose youre really intended to craft them thats how i got 95% of my gear however if you are into costumizing your looks well youre in luck the prices for cosmetics in this game are very resonable and with the daily chance to get a 25%  50% or 75% discount on the paid currency you can end up with a ton for dirt cheap warframe the space ninja simulator recommended

even though some people may complain about this game for its excessive grind or the need to pay money at its core its a fun space ninja shooter instead of having the take cover against the enemies they have to take cover against you my only complaint about this game would be the excessive grind in some areas and the seemingly neverending cycle of patch introduce more bugs patch again 7510

a game where you spent 80% of it grinding to get the good stuff only to realize later that there was better stuff and after you grind for that stuff you realize an update came out with new and better stuff so you grind for that stuff until you realize that others have better stuff than you i call that a winwin maybe also contain some rage inducing orokin cells

warframe is unique in many good ways and in many bad too the premise of the game itself is brilliant space ninjasamurai that fight robotmen and plauge beasts its radical and filled with flashy effects that youd expect from a third person shooter mixed with a spectacle fighter with an interesting and indepth lore to boot its hard to fault warframe for what it offers and the price it offers it for free there is however something to note warframe features a cash shop that allows you buy anything within the game for platinum your platinum account is charged by real world money and doing so gives you a huge boost within the game i want to stress though that everything every single item can be gained in game without the use of platinum to do so though makes the game a massive grind starting solo and venturing into the game for the first time my personal experience was that this game truly comes close to forcing you to have to pay for some item to break up the norm of running the same mission over and over again in order to gain new weapon upgrades before spending any money on the game i was on my way to gaining my prime warframe but purchasing a pack of platinum surpassed all build times item requirments and even allowed me to double my modification slots a great free game that becomes grounded by a borderline questionable payment methods if you can deal with the occasional grind its well worth it and i can totally deal with the grind

the only downside to this game is that there is no open world or even sandbox type environment to expand immersion within the world in virtually every other aspect the game is a dreamlike playground for fans of games like mass effect unreal tournament or in some ways even prince of persia and ninja gaiden there is wall running handled in a well executed manner there is melee combat complete with actual combos and timing as well as blocking there is evil space creatures and factions to kill and hate and there is a huge array of both weapons and warframes to choose from and collect in order to diversify your experience even recently a new system of flight combat was added straight out of a space shooter sim hybrid while it is true the game is very light on story line or explanation and can become quite grindy after a deep binge of obsessive exposure the core systems of the game are bieng constantly improved and there is no pay 2 win mechanic because anything you can acquire through the shop except for a very few cosmetics are all obtainable in game pvp players be warned however this game is not about pvp at all and the pvp aspect of the game is not very well realized or implemented at this point while pvp is playable it is certainly not for everyone and is not what the game is focused around at all

note my review has been edited warframe is a coop kind of game that is more fun to play with friends than playing alone the game can drag out if you are trying to get materials to build that next warframe or weapon or expand your dojo if you are gathering materials completing missions or just down right killing things if you do it solo dont get me wrong this game can be played solo and some people like myself dont mind soloing but the experience is improved tenfold when you are playing with friends or even other strangers online warframe takes place in the future within our own solar system and beyond you are a tenno an ancient warrior who uses the suit of the warframes to restore peace and balance to our solar system which has errupted in chaos the tenno are a master of all weapons including boomerangs blades long swords daggers scythes heavy weapons bows and all sorts of guns to add onto the fastpaste action warframe will provide the tenno are defined as spaceninjas since they have the agility of one tenno can wall climb run on walls and posses unique skills to help you navigate the levels of the game along with feeling a sense of accomplishment as you slice through hordes of enemies as i stated earlier you can play alone with friends or with strangers the game is defaulted to have you play with other strangers which will equal a squad of four with each mission you go through your squad will be tasked with a series of missions such as survival extermination capturing hostages and so on you can adjust the settings to where you can play either with friends only or play on your own however the first few planets such as earth and mercury can be easy to navigate solo but the higher up levels such as the void phobos and so forth are highly recommended you go in with a squad of three other players who are also experienced within the game no matter which mission you pick and what level you choose or who you play with warframe will provide a fast experience and you will have to adapt quickly in order to survive a mission an example would include this i was aboard a corpus cruise shuttle in space and i accidentally missed my shot at one of the enemies and hit a window in turn it shattered and the air in that room was being sucked out and i was losing health rather quickly i had to quickly dispatch the majority of enemies in the room and then i had to hack the nearest computer i could find as soon as i was done hacking the computer the safety locks for the windows kicked in and air was restored to the room keeping me alive this game is free to play and i would personally recommend that you give it a try the worst that can happen is you dont like the game and you can uninstall it it doesnt cost you anything but with that said you will get a sense of a pay to win environment in this game you see you can start out with three warframes to pick from loki mag or excalibur you then get a small selection of weapons to choose from but if you ever want to get any other warframes or weapons than what you had to pick from there are two ways to go about it 1 buying the blueprints with ingame cash called credits and then having to gather the materials needed to build that weapon or warframe note weapons can be super easy to find the materials for depending on what weapons you want to build but warframes are ridiculously unfair as it can take a very long time to find the rare components to craft them with 2 you guessed it paying real money to get platinum which is the fastest solution to earning practically everything in this game you can buy booster packs coloring options for your warframesweaponsship weapons and warframes sooner skins and so forth using platinum some things are exclusive to platinum only such as the booster packs and coloring palletes meaning there is no way to earn these items without spending any realworld cash on i understand that that can be rather frustrating as gamers but as a free to play game the developers need to earn money somehow they do offer login rewards which you can obtain by logging in once a day one of the many rewards you can earn from the login reward is a 25% 50% or even 75% discount on platinum for 2448 hours while warframe can feel like a pay to win environment at times at least they are willing to discount their realworld currency for those who want platinum but dont want to spend an obsurd amount on it plus the majority of things such as the warframes and weapons can be obtained for free they just take much longer i have spent many hours in warframe and it does have its bugs that are still being worked out but my experience in the game has been a great one all around i would recommend that you play with a friend but the experience is still amazing if you are playing alone or with strangers they offer many social features such as a clan for you to join and you can have a clan dojo to go along with it the playerbase is very much alive and there is always players online no matter what time of day you are on but when in missions the game provides fastpast action and at times you really need to think fast in order to survive the outcome the game still has major updates and they keep adding something new every few months one of my personal newer favorite updates they have added is the archwing when you become a level 2 initiate you can quest to build your very own archwing what the archwing is is an device that allows you to explore the vastness of space flying around in freedom once you obtain your first archwing and go out into space for the first time you will notice that the flight controls are fantastic i dont think i have ever played a game with such wellbuilt flight controls as what warframe provides for the archwing levels space combat has never been funner because of major updates such as the archwing i look forward to future updates knowing that there will be more coming in the near future warframe will be one of those games that will stay alive for years to come it has the playerbase and it has the developers to stay going despite the times of feeling pay to win i would recommend that you give the game a try and see if you like it there are different ways for you to play whether you want to go into missions full on stealth or go in with guns blazing it is a free download why not give it a try and see how you like it
recommended
from the hours ive spent in the game i can say that it definitely has depth going further than the flashy spaceninja simulator that can capture people at first glance the microtransaction system is userfriendly to say the least as im sure it has been said before it is not p2w everything noncosmetical can be acquired with ingame currency and a little patience the frames themselves feel quite different and the combat system is awesome and responsive theres a humongous amount of content even in earlygame id definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a scifi third person shooter\fighter hybrid and the somewhat exotic asian approach of the tenno culture can be yet another positive feature
recommended
this game is a lot of fun to play not only because of its good looking graphics quality or variety of available things to do but that gameplay is not limited if you dont choose to buy platinum
recommended
not pay to win which is how it seems on the surface the only items you have to buy with platinum that is the ingame currency are visual items everything else is aquired using blueprints that you either find or purchase and then materials that you find some a lot harder than others the game play is great fun run around hacking and slashing burn them to death with fire as an ember warframe or stand at the back and snipe it is really your choice you can play a stealth role if you so desire the game can be quite overwhelming at first but it amazing once you get into it the player base is really friendly and i have met a few people who help me whenever i need it which is most of the time btw i recommend this game to anyone
recommended
oh warframe its a pretty one of a kind game i cant really say there are any downsides with the actual game but there are some annoying mechanics that are kind of on the side from the core gameplay experience first of all the games gorgeous if you can run it with everything maxed out just beautiful and there is a lot of content to do but it does get repetitive although its kind of relaxing just like many people find grindy asian mmos relaxing or the grind of diablo relaxing just running around slaughtering hundreds upon hundreds of aliens and robots mindlessly doing parkour jumps off  like the badass space ninja cowboy you are its a fastpaced shoot em up hack n slash with a tinge of cardcollecting your mods that modify your gameplay and your abilities the group gameplay is fun if youve got 13 buddies to team up with and chat over skype or something do some of the higherend content and have a blast and get sweet loot theyve recently been putting out a lot more content than they did when i played but most of my friends have clocked out of their time playing this game so i dont see myself returning for very long if i do theyve added new characters to play new maps new quests etc the developers are great very close to the community have a casual conversation with them on reddit maybe even ingame and they really do love their game and try to push it forward and keep it relevant and id say theyre doing a great job
recommended
this game is so fun a little grindy sometimes but its fun play with a friend and you can progress together
recommended
i am incredilbly impressed with this and amazed that its free not only is it super fun but it looks wonderful graphics wise even at minimum settings the style and game play remind me of something like mass effect smacking into metal gear sword slashing and high tech pistols in space my only concern is the controls im not sure if it explains further in later tutorials but its pretty slow in evaluating in all of the controls and buttons however its a nonexistant problem and doesnt affect the game play
recommended
it is such a great game i reccomend it to all my friends its challenging just the way i like it  xd
recommended
this is a great game for a fun time anytime
recommended
im a fan of the muliplayer fps mmo and rpg scenes i love the idea of an fps in a diablo suit but i was worried it would be too repetitive would the replayability be there the answer a circumstantial yes i would highly reccomend that you play this game with friends if you are solo the game can quickly become tedious however with friends time flies by something else that is not readily apparent  there is a somewhat steep learning curve to this game understanding how mods interact with polarity slots how damage is calculated various weaknesses and strengths and learning all the warframes really what style of play suits you can be a daunting task new players will find the first system of missions easy enough but will soon find enemies that prove a real challenge the correct application of mods on your warframe and weapons will be essential all in all digital extremes is putting in a great deal of work into making this game an amazing experience updates are constant its free to play with an ingame store for both normal currency and paid currency everything that can be bought with real money can also be obtained without real money except extra inventory space and a few cosmetics and without too much difficulty try it out  what have you got to lose

its pretty good i like it

beautiful game with tons of fun coop gameplay pick it up its free

before you read this reveiw you must consider these questions three is the game worth my money is the game worth my time are the developers in touch with the community now that youve done this i will read your mind and answer three questions you have about warframe is the game worth my money i will dismiss this question out of hand as a simple glance at the price will answer this is the game worth my time this is where it gets tricky to answer warframe isnt for everyone theres no underaged kids telling you that youre a haxxer theres not very much math involced and worst of all theres precious few instances of acronyms andor bizzare phraseology with which to confuse new players in all seriousness however there are problems with warframes delivery the gameplay itself is fun the perfect blend of fast and tactical with enough customizability on warframes and weapons to allow a broad variety of playstyles the troubles come when not playing the game however a new player after slowly acquiring the blueprints and materials nescessary to build a brandnew warframe will suddenly find themselves faced with an intimidating threeday wait until its done and warframe makes it very clear that a little cash will make it go faster when i first built a new warframe it was ember if i remember correctly i rapidly went from excited to depressed to angry to saddened to the new player this wait is an annoying wall that stands between them and fun a barrier placed by malicious and evil developers who hate all manner of fun and enjoyment fast forward to a few months later when this oncenew player has three warframes they need to rank up two waiting to be claimed and another building although warframes enforced waiting period seems like a cheap moneygrab at low levels it becomes less and less meaningful to a patient and determined player as they progress however this is really the most important thing about warframe if you arnt patient if like veruca salt you want it now then warframe will probably irritate and annoy you if you have the patience to stick with it however youll find a fun and entertaining game with a good variety of gameplay and weapons are the developers in touch with the community if youve made it to this part of the reveiw you should get yourself a cookie once youve done that ill answer this question yes the developers digital extremes is very in touch with the community releasing fairly frequent updates and devstreams they keep a good touch on what the players want and do their best to deliver it with only a few instances of failure were not likely to see the next cube worldstomping land in warframe in summary the only drawback of warframe is the patience required to get started with that said however its free so why not try it out and see how you like it see you in the game tenno
recommended
review time so this is a pretty good game problem is it doesent really explain what to do as a newb to this game 15 years ago i was lost if you find that you are in this situation then i guarentee that you will hate this game it has no direction and the mindless killing doesent really have much replay for the first frameweapon and starter planets but with time and persistance and a little bit of spending creddits for better gear then i guarentee that you will enjoy the massive ammount of weapons to choose from couppled with warframe abilities warframes are easy to aquire and weapons are really cheep for the most part farming for monney is easy to do as long as you have someone in trade chat carry you to a high level mision for easy monney finally for a last opinion i would despite all i have said get in a guild and play with people this game is not meant for solo and playing with a squad of 4 is much more fun than sticking it out by yourself
recommended
this is a game that takes a bit of getting used to but once youre in youll love it rushing around doing parkour and shooting bad guys feels good and the abilities of each warframe can feel awesome when used right take the time to learn the game and youll find yourself immersed in one of the best free to play experiences on the pc right now and its only getting better
recommended
warframe presents a fastpaced immersive and cooperative gameplay experience warframe is an ots shooter or ots hacknslash game depending on the players preference players construct from a generous library of weapons and warframes which are essentially ninja spacebattle suits each of which drastically alters the games play style in this way warframe is a highly customizable experience and makes way for player specialization inamongst their squads and clans warframe is a cooperative game though players can run missions and accomplish most goals by themselves or with internet randoms the game is much better suited for squads maximum size of four of friends who can work cooperatively and communicate verbally via external voice comms each mission balances itself according to the size of the squad playing it but the best challenges and rewards are only realistically available to larger groups warframe places new players directly into a series of tutorial missions which comprehensively explain the mechanics of the game because of this warframes moderate learning curve is very easily mastered this games soundtrack is appropriate and envigorating but the true artistic strength of the game lies in its graphic design the visual effects of battle and the tacit graphical base of the scenery and setpieces compliment each other and afford an immersive combat experience warframe is appropriate for novice and mature gamers though the game is free of any agesensitive content the violent nature of the game may not be appropriate for younger audiences previous experience with fps and combat gameplay is recommended but not strictly necessary warframe is freetoplay driven by optional ingame purchases all story and gameplay content can be unlocked via gameplay but players can at any point obtain nearly any item in the game in exchange for money this does not inhibit gameplay or diminish the enjoyment of others as players do not compete and ones overall rank is only improved by game time warframe can be played casually or hardcore and is worth considerably more than the time it takes to give it a try
recommended
alright so this is a highly recomended game its really fun and awesome 3 so join me on the game ahahaha ninjas play free 3
recommended
its amazing
recommended
oh yeah this game is a a aswome there tons of level a lot or friends fun and the feeling is amazing look you need to build stuff to make some weapons that you can buy only in cash there are some weapens for cash to but the point here every body should play it if there was a lot of player it will be ton of fun except that warframe have clansthat you can create rare suits and weapons with it they want you to play with friends so go now dawnload it and have fun
recommended
great game i love it but it can get repetative sometimes but if you got a great group of friends to play with it can be a really awesome game and i see the people all like  but its pay to win thats it just pay to win and yes i will say there are some aspects that show the pay to win but as playing this game i have found that even people who pay real world money on warframes and weapons are really just as good as you myself ive been running an excalibur the very 1st starter warframe for 2 weeks and i can keep up with all the others in high risk mission ive actually been better then a lot of frost loki rhino and mag primes its just how you play if you run and gun or if you play it smart from a distance 9  10 if you have the time play it warframes a great game to play just make sure you got the time cause the mission can be really time consuming
recommended
810 the game can be pretty aggressive on purchasing platinum since it is a freetoplay and it requires a lot of grinding at first but it is well worth it very fun game with tons of options and challenges with a good steam account sync
recommended
this game is a great grind its grind are 1010 i went ahead of my frind because i was bored of playing aneeded to grind if u liked destiny you will love this but i will hate u casue destiny is  and can go burn this could be destiny its destiny

very fun and addicting however repetitive gameplay makes the game dull off after a month or two of constant play however the developers constantly release new updates and features that brings in gamers old and new
recommended
yes i would recommeded this to friends go and try it pros fun and awesome game play with friend and kill some bad guys upgrade your warframe characters and weapons long and lots of missions cons lots of grinding to get ranks up but still fun and part of the game when i first play it i had no clue what to do or where to go but eventually you will get there once you look around and figure out rate 810 recommend yes
recommended
amazing game and loads of fun to play with friends be prepared that this is a progression type of game and there is a lot of grinding to be done before you are powerful enough to enjoy the whole game be prepared to work for things you want over time  if you are not wanting to spend too much money easily one of the best f2p games ever
recommended
there is so much to love about this game everything from the controlsmechanics the warframes you play as and the many types of weapons to choose from its a 1010 for me
recommended
1010 would ordis again
recommended
love this game although my router wont let me forward ports its still a great game to go solo aswell i enjoy the aspect of gathering materials to build weapons and researching parts i like the aspect of different frames with different abilities and modding capabilities overall great game
recommended
warframe is an entirely new asthetic instead of taking cover to dodge bullets you make cover stealth around or even dodge bullets and lasers with your mad ninja skillz warframe is a thrid person shooter with emphasis on grinding and on teamwork if you seek to play this amazing game id recommend a team of four you and three of your ninjaest friends with some form of vocal interaction such as teamspeak or razer comms as ive not gotten the vocal settings figured out in game yet if you enjoy the grind like in monster hunter or phantasy star youll love warframe and remember space ninjas play free
recommended
basically ninjamech simulator lots of warframes lots of missions lots of weapons and lots of ways to get yourself stuck outside of the map one of my favorite shotter games ever

warframe is not without its shortcomings with regards to skillgap balance and friendliness to novice players but its also hugely entertaining de have absolutely nailed that just one more mission loop when you find a group of players who work as a team or just a friendly player to partner up with for story missions it can be absolutely thrilling survival missions where each teammember works to help others while fending off wave after wave of enemies is a total rush when you pull off some impossible feat of swordgunbased acrobatics it is gratifying like few other games on the other hand there is a considerable skillgap get beyond the initial public missions and you will often find people playing the game at a level of skill and speed that renders novice players little more than a burden there are also a baffling amount of systems and upgrade trees to navigate upgrades have upgrades theres definitely a part of me that likes the fact that in a lot of ways its very unabashedly hardcore but i would certainly caution new players that it requires a level of dedication they might not be willing to give but if you like the sound of spaceninjas pulling off improbable feats of death acrobatics against hordes of enemies that look like they were the product of tsutomu niheis fever dreams and youre prepared to put in the hours to learn how to master the games myriad systems then i totally recommend you pick this up and spend a few bucks in the store addendum for those worried about the f2p aspect spending a bit of money will save you a lot of pain and grind but you can absolutely play this game and have a thoroughly good time without spending a penny it is not a paytowin scenario
recommended
this is the only free to play game i will ever play but the recent updates have been giving me bad frame rate 
recommended
if you guys like gunz u will love this game
recommended
as long as you are okay with farming alot of your supplies you will love this game it is not a pay to win type of game everything that you can by can either be found or made but you have to put in the time to do so if you want to work on patitence then this is a good game to start with
recommended
very good game 1010 pros  beautiful graphics  active gameplay  endless content  a broad range of customization  over 100 ways to kill something  f2p cons uhh guys help me think of one
recommended
it takes time to know that warframe is a good game playing with friends often helps
recommended
its free but youll want to spend money
recommended
this game is something special it is actually a real free to play game everything can be earned by playing if you want to buy something off of the store with plat that you can only get by plat all you gotta do is play the game and sell the mods to other players for actual plat the game just all around feels good looks good and plays good there is a lot to do a great community and cmon lets be real here graphics do sometime make a difference in warframe the graphics are stunning and if you have physx then you will love it i recommend this game to anyone shooterrpg fan or not you need to try it
recommended
this is what destiny should have been like if you were ever thinking of getting destiny dont just get this its 10x better and actually has content will definitely be supporting the devs as much as possible great game
recommended
great third person futuristic assasins creed kind of game

free to play slightly addicting and self challenging can be very repetitive but its all in the story you make for yourself much more enjoyable with others to play with ive logged over 500hrs without anyone that i knew and its a let down grab some buds and make your story as you go it will be fun i promise enjoy
recommended
i highly recommend this game to all players that like 3rd person shooters this game isnt very laggy if you crank the settings down and its overall a great game try it out
recommended
this game is free to play one of the best shooter game ive played graphic is beauty and the concept is fresh if youre a ninja like me and looking for good coop space shooter games this is the game for you very recommend this game

how good is this game well i just realised i played over 800 ing hours go figure 10 anteaters out of 10

recommended
eh get it i guess not really my thing
recommended
probably one of the most fun games i have ever played 1010 would play again still playing
recommended
warframe is like destiny in third person mode doesnt suck as bad and is free to play now before you go and think this is just another pay to win game think again you can get everything in the game through lots of grinding and i mean lots but thats what makes it worth it when you finally get that one warframe you always wanted the game in total has around 20 farframes to choose from and now update 16 released youll be sure to find even more weapons warframes and content to keep you busy the game overall is pretty solid graphic look really good for a f2p that came out in 2012 the music is also quite good however theres not really a huge music score in the game movement in the game is quite fluid once you get used to it and master wall running jumping sprinting etc story is meh its lore is somewhat interesting seeing as its based off an older game called darksector which was the kick start toward warframe that we now know and love comunnity is also probably the best ive seen in any of the ftps ive played very helpful and kind players that often help new players with getting through certain mission resource farming and finding warframe parts how you play this game is up to you you can be good with anything if you have the time and patience to bring out the potential with your warframe and weapons overall this game is one of the best and most unique games ive ever played despite the minor matchmacking issues and occasional glitches this game is a very well made game with a good developer supporting it and a very kind community thats welcoming to new comers 8510 for me d

i would like a way to start over and delete progress
recommended
amazing game 910 the game gets repetitive after awhile but all the weapons updates armor and power
recommended
the game without the bells and whistles is just one hell of a grindfest but dammit its a good one new tutorial constant expansion of the game and evolving storyline makes this a great game to add to your library the game does start very slow however and takes some time to get moving but when it does itll take a while before you stop did anyone forget to mention it was still in beta best freetoplay game ive ever played
recommended
i love this game 
recommended
real solid mmo shooter with great battle mechanics and fluid movement
recommended
love this game dont understand the official critics low scores i would recomend this to anyone
recommended
surprisingly good for a coop shooter everything that global agenda shouldve been in actuality bring three friends blast it up bear in mind that everything within the game can be obtained just by playing  spending money is only a shortcut if anything
recommended
good game keeps things interesting with events and different circumstances they constantly bring out and constant updates to weaponry and activites make this a very good game to play key features and the best parts are the variety of weaponry and modification and the warframes themselves negative features are the maps themselves have clearly copied and pasted areas once you see 23 rooms in a map youve seen it all of that template all in all fun game with friends ive wasted so many hours myself on it but what would make it perfect is new maps that arent full of copy and pasted areas and a new race other than the corpus or grineer and the infected mix it up   well 1000 hours later in the game there are some things that need to be said de the devs have a bad habit of ignoring bugs and glitches and visually unfinished models that they implement into the game and make decisions based on how much plat they will make out of the game if you find a farming method that is anywhere near effective it will be nerfed if you find a system that works it will be changed if you find anything that makes you feel good they will usually take it away im not speaking personally on this but all the decisions de has made make it painfully clear that they are only interested in how much you pay up i mean fair enough but sometimes they make one too many wrong decisions and  a lot of people off they dont think about their fixes they dont understand repurcussions or the what their fixes do to the rest of the populace also they just released jarjar binks as a warframe lmao enough said there
recommended
if you think space ninjas with guns is hype i recomend it there is farming involed but the story is amazing
recommended
this is my favourite game evaaaaaarrrr
recommended
it is amazing it may not seem like it at first but if you get a friend or two it becomes the best coop game ive ever played
recommended
there is a bit of a learning curve with warframe but just push through the first 10 hours or so and youll find an incredibly addicting experience if you like 3rd person shooters and the scifi genre or just blowing things up i highly recommend you give it a look
recommended
finally feeling like a ninja with the melee overhaul pros  good graphics some low res textures here and there though  lots of customization even without $$$ as you can trade parts for premium money  huge playerbase  lots of updates  quick loading times  melee is a real combat option feels like a different game neutral  archwing is nice but needs more mixing with normal gameplay like in the first awmission cons  only a few quests  unbalanced weapons and powers  still a huge grindfest  rng item farming warframe has lured me back with the new updates and i guess its a nice timesink score 70100 improved a lot over the years
recommended
really laggy but is a great game in all
recommended
i have had the most fun with this game in the short amount of time ive had to play it i cant play it right now since my laptop no longer has the horsepower needed to run it and since its online i made a few good friends in the prosses that im pretty sure i probably wouldnt even know if i never played this game this is the kind of game thats allot more fun with friends and even then this game is really fun alone and it can spark new and sometimes life long friendships if your lucky like i was so for anyone on the fence about downloading this game i highly recommend this game its free it has really fun gameplay and like i said before if your lucky you will meet some cool people that you can have fun with
recommended
this game is quite fun with friends

swift and smooth this game will work in almost any computer exceptions applied is totaly worth buying some dlcs the best is that you only have to pay if you want no payment needed to win anything 1010
recommended
ok so this game will be repetitive at the start just a bitbut when you start doing void missions and start getting prime parts the game will open up more also i suggest installing a warframe alert app on your smartphone just beacuse you can miss a lot of good stuf just by not knowing about it i suggest to everybody to try this game and give it a shot

as a beta game or freetoplay i would say its great overall bugs and glitches should be expected throught your gameplay experience and they are not hitting on players too hard though therefore its not overall so bad for the bugs part if you are like me you will always find the bugs funny for the gameplay experience its a werid action game because it combines typical third person shooting games actions with magic power especially after the upcoming update for the parkour20 system although there is some tank type character you still need to play the same mission over and over again aka farming to gain rare mods or rare items to build your ultimate weapons it is similar to how you keep pickaxing and shoveling in minecraft just to build a dream house and if you do not play minecraft it will be just like how you get gold and diamond skins for your guns in cod of course you can pay a lot to purchase items from other players or the prime access another important thing is to join a clan or find some pal to play with it is a coop game you may go solo but it would be too hard to level up because bonus experience points can be gained through playing with other players remember to pay attention to the abilities of every warframe because every character aka warframe has hisher special abilities like nekross desecrate can increase drop rates some of the warframes may not need heavy protection too if you have built it right like limbo playing intelligently will not casuse you any damage at all gaming experience is great but the problem is warframe should start working on creating some exclusive things for players who had hunted a lot of things many new players are just buying every stuff to make themselves fit in the high level or veteran players community this is kind of annoying though they are the people who are supporting the game in a financial way and also there should be more competitive gameplay added to this game maybe a clan war this can make the game more fun but i suppose this cannot be done by looking at the engine and server for now this one will only for the new players the missions and tutorial can be quite confusing it is totally not a good time to start off playing this game right now as there are bunches of new things added to this game just remember do not rely on your primary weapon too much check and try out all your abilities every weapon you can obtain find your favorite set up and play this is my opinion it may not mean a lot but this is the comment i have on this game after playing for a year happy hunting tenno

one of the only shooters i like because the rpg elements are reasonably compelling some menu items are mouse only but otherwise you can play with a gamepad just pray to the gods of rng with warframe it can take a lot of grinding to get what you want since its typically not a steady stream of predictable rewards but rather a completely random chance of getting a reward based on the roll of the dice cash shop isnt too intrusive you can play without paying easily though if you dont want to look ugly or have barely any inventory space youll want to cough up 5 or 10 usd for some color palletes and inventory spaces

ninjas play free those are the three words i wont forget for a very long time having first began playing warframe at the beginning of open beta back when there were a handful of tilesets the ui was simplistic and generally the game felt so much smaller at some point i grew disillusioned with the game and left it for atleast an entire year looking back now its great to see how much it has grown i returned only a week ago but there is still much work to be done  the title of beta becomes readily apparent when you realise digital extremes has a multitude of undocumented changes and nerfs in their hotfixes as well as glitches and imbalances between many of the titular frames but it is however a thirdperson shooting hackyslashy parkour ninja simulator and one of my favourite games of all time for its intuitive fastpaced and fluid combat which flows brilliantly as one switches from oversized machinegun to pocket laser shotgun to jetpowered hammer the most important question is however is it fun well it certainly has its flaws for newer players itll be an uphill struggle since you wont be all too familiar with it youll have to really farm for some of your gear and sometimes rngesus will kick you in the balls there are some annoying enemies too like grineer manics who zip around and teleport constantly or nullifiers who remove your warframes buffs when you enter their shields my answer yes play this bloody game give it a chance  after all digital extremes had this baby from the getgo this is what darksector was supposed to be

and heres my book warframe one of the most popular online fps rpgs on the market today warframe has already collected quite the crowd three million is the current lastpublished number for the player base of this game with online guide support one is never lost in this game as it is constantly changing created by digital extremes de this game is nothing short of constantly updated if you ever find a bug or that something isnt correct you can guarantee that it wont be the situation for long if youre not too big on pc gaming anyway just buy it for ps4 releasing nov 15 2013 in the us oh wait i didnt mention that the game is absolutely free if its not your cup of tea no problem you simply delete it off of your hard drive and your out of nothing but your time however if you do enjoy this game like the many others who tried it youll be sucked into the universe or solar system more correctly of the tenno now dont think this game has some magical gripping storyline the missions are extremely repetitive and somewhat lackluster however the amount of content available is simply astonishing i have at this current time 196 hours of time played in warframe i still feel as if i havent scratched the surface if youre worried about spending money you shouldnt worry at all if you want to play this game in the sub100 hours range then you should be fine if not i would say $50$75 should complete the entire purchase of the game considering the fact that fallout 3 plus all its dlc was $120 im not too concerned on that price range if youre interested of hours of addictive gameplay filled with ninja robots and a whole lot of dead people youve come to the right place fight on tenno

this game is a great free to play i really insist you get it this game is very different for a free to play game it actaully doesnt look like a lower resolution game this game offers stunning graphics and glorious lighting and after you get over the lovely graphics you can head straight to the high impact fighting this game has a level system and you can set your character to however your play style is if you enjoy staffs and swords use the mods and make a melee build or if you prefer automatics use some mods and make a rifle build just incase you get annoyed with your character you can always get a new class a warframe to be exact this game has a high replay value and i enjoy playing it one downside to this game is that its pay to win but that doesnt even matter to be honest 1010  best space game ever

first week i thought this game was pay to win because thats exactly how its set up to look turns out its not you can trade players items for premium currency pictures and videos do this game no justice at all i woulda hated this game unless i played it which thankfully i did no regrets so far also the price tag is pretty nice too cant argue with free sometimes waiting for gear to finish being crafted can be a bit brutal but if you dont mind being paitent then you are good

im gonna start off by saying i have always been horrid at shooter games so i was hesitant to try this out a friend plays it extensively so i thought id give it a go and i am hooked this game is so much fun the missions the weapons the companions the frames i have fun just collecting things and leveling them i play quite a bit with public matchmaking and i have yet to find a negative person the community overall is very helpful and patient with beginners also i love the fact that you can get just about everything in game that you can spending cash to purchase platinum and buy items outright i dont feel this is a paytowin sort of game which is refreshing i highly recommend this game ^_^

ive already done a full review elsewhere httpsk986terminalsquarespacecomk986games201366warframe but the main thing to know here is that it is a good substitute for the me3 multiplayer if you dont have it for pc the dev team is constantly working to upgrade and make their game better all the while trying to listen to the huge slurry of player responses and generate new content at the same time as a f2p its one of the more effective layouts ive seen  as you can earn everything except slots to put things in entirely just by spending the time to grindfarmluck it out the pricing seems to be a bit steep as is most f2p games out there but its also not unreasonable considering the charges are essentially just there to replace the time investment on most items lots of unique classes in the warframes lots of different weapons an ongoing beta that has resulted in numerous fundamental systems being overhauled in one way shape or form  its worth a try at the very least  even more so if you play with friends
recommended
this game is fun amazingly so but it has its cons too one of the facts that i love so much about this game is that most of the features are really unique like you can buy a lot of stuff for platinum premium credits but you can get platinum without having to spend a cent got a rare mod or items sell them in the trading section for platinum that you can use and trade however you wish the leveling system is fun as well there are 2 types of levels weapon and character levels and there are also mastery ranks basically the difference is that mastery rank can only climb in xp there are 17 of them and each more different than the last but how you get xp is unique as well you get 100 mastery xp from leveling up your weapon and 200 for leveling up your warframe and when you have enough for a level up you face a master rank challenge that differs each time first killing with primary weapon within time limit then kill with secondary then with melee then here come the fun part the fourth is hacking consoles withing the time limit it is a sort of minigame within the game you can do to reset alerts the the fifth is sharpshooting shooting assigned targets within the time limit weapons level ups dont make you weapon stronger but it gives 1 mod capacity per level at the maximum of 30 levels but you can use a orokin catalyst or a orokin reactor to double the mod capacity to 60 in game term this is called poatoing due to the shape of them changing your mods can drastically improve you weapons from adding elemental damage to increasing damage to adding clip size total amunition or increasing fire rate the mods for warframes are different they give plus shield capacity plus health and buffs such as those but also they can give things such as loot and enemy radars make a shockwave from your feet when you jump from high up and land but also the adition of aura mods are available for warframes and melee weapons aura mods give extra mod capicity and grants you bonuses such as energy regen or health regen some give gun damage or extra health or extra ammo polarities are basically types of mods if you match a mod polarity with a weapon or a warframe polarity it only costs half if you mismatch the polarities it costs 1 or 2 more aura mods give double plus in mod capicity if matched with the right polarity forma you can use on max level weapons or frames to reset their level to level 0 but it does not make it any more powerful instead you can alter one slot to what ever polarity you want making you ale to fit more powerful mods on it now enough of this pros lets talk cons this game is glitchy and sometimes has poor ai i have seen it time and time again where an enemy is hiding behind a wall and wont do anything unless you are standing in their faces this game is unbelievably grindy when you have played it much even as little as i have you start to have a plethora of resources i have like 60000 of everything common that drops in packages of 200300 and i have up to 150 of the rarest resources the game counters that with argon crystals to get argon crystals you must first grind for a key that randomly drops in survival or defence misions then you must do the mission the key opens and hope you get an extra rare resource i have done 4 of these missions with loot radar and not get 1 of them so finally you got an argon crystal but surprise it disappears from your inventory after 24 hours and some require to have 3 of these things so for the most powerful and most grindy weapon out there the dragon nikana you had to farm for 75 oxium which you could only get by defeating specific flying enemies called oxium osprey oh and here is the catch if you shoot them they suicide bomb you and you get no drops try to use melee and they fly away so after weeks of grinding for oxium you need to have 1 forma as well forma blueprints are found as a login reward or in special alert missions and making it takes 1 of every ultra rare resource morphics gallium neural sensors and 24 hours to wait oh and did i mention the 3 argon crystal that are required as well so finally you got your nikana but to upgrade that to the dragon nikana you need to have 1 argon crystal another 75 oxium and the mastery rank of 8 that takes a long time so you can grind and grind and grind for hours but you cant keep using your same weapons or else you wont get any mastery rank ups i didnt figure this out so i spent 70 hours without switching weapons so i am only in mastery rank 6 now

this review is split into sections using numerals to show each section my rating all in all i would rate it an 810 would recommend if you can deal with a decent amount of grinding and some bugs also this game is still in beta i the game modes are exterminate eliminate all enemies mobile defense taking a datamass to a control panel then defending it defense defending something for 5 waves at a time survival survive a mass onslaught of enemies for as long as possible rewards every 10 minutes excavate defend and keep a scanner and its excavators powered to extract resources interception you capture and defend several points from being taken over by enemies sabotage destroy a reactor assassinate all boss missions and to kill high valued targets and hijack defend a mobile target and possibly destroy it the game is 100% coop unless you go to the pvp player versus player areas graphics are good gameplay is very grindy sometimes buggy and very well balanced bugs well crap ii the game is grind worthy grinding through many missions to progress is slightly boring but considering that each mission is never the same in the sense that they will always look different from the last time you played it all weapons can be op if you mod then properly and you obtain mods from trading other players rewards from missions or by defeating enemies there are warframes which is basically your suit with magical powers that are very destructive against enemies there are 300ish missions and more than 10 different planetsmoons with 10 or more missions each with their matching environmental art styles each warframe has their own special four abilities unique to that warframe warframes abilities range from being able to turn invisible to being able to stomp the ground and suspend all the enemies in the air to shooting spikes into every enemy within your sights the weapons in game can range from a jet power hammer to a pistol that shoots rockets to a gun that shoots circular blades or bolts the lore is very simple and easy to remember there are three main factions the grineer that are a bunch of brain washed clones the corpus that probably are like humans and the infested that are infested creatures of doom there is an enemy called the stalker that rarely shows up if a boss curses you and then there are the g3 and zanuka that do the same thing you have these syndicates that are 6 different groups you sign up with one and then you trade this thing called standing for a mod that boosts your warframes abilities or a weapon or something else the basic 300 missions are the normal missions then there are void missions and derelict missions void missions come in 4 tiers each increasing tier number indicates increasing difficulty there is a void boss called corrupted vor he comes around just as rarely as the stalker does but only in the void derelict are basically the tier 3 and 4 but only with infested enemies also customization of your warframeweapons is pretty good you can change every color to whatever you want and same for additional cosmetics credits are the basic currency in the game orokin ducats are prime pieces rewards from void missions traded for special currency to be traded for primed modscosmetics and the premium currency platinum platinum can be earned by the login rewards by trading rare modsprime components or by purchasing them archwing i have not done too much of this yet as such i am unable to give 100% valid information afaik as far as i know you have a jetpack and fly through space and continue your basic objectives and you can go fast just like sonic the hedgehog this is mainly unfinished structure added into the game there have been several alerts in game using this game type but it remains with little content iii alerts one of the best ways of acquiring rare modsitems is through dailyspecial alerts there are daily alerts that often reward with only credits or a few resources but sometimes they have a rare mod or weapon as a reward sometimes rare resources normally a weapon or some high cost item would be reward from a tactical alert rarely some type of cosmetic items tactical alerts are long and tedious alerts that last a week or so in which the player needs to complete a very hard challenge in order to obtain said items the tactical alerts are mainly for experienced players who are looking for challenge iv raids raids are very hard in my opinion much more difficult than tactical alerts they offer a rare arcane item and require a massive amount of teamwork there currently is only one raid in the game it has several team based puzzleschallenges which works well with 8 player squads in the end you face off a very easy to kill boss as long as you dont die my rating all in all i would rate it an 810 would recommend if you can deal with much grindingsome bugs absolute nonsense

after playing warframe for 1000 hours ill say it definetely was a blast and still is it never ceases to fail me that it always made me and my friends feel like were badasses one shotting things and wiping rooms in mere seconds made me feel like a god almost when ever it came to the hard stuff it was a bunch a teamwork and skill to output such great results whether it be survival or defense missions although this game is not perfect with its few glitches and grindfests freaking rng >_< i feel it has come along way and from its beta till now this game is about the journey not the quest sometimes 3

up to now itve been great playing this game

fantastic game lots of gamemodes and large variety of weapons not those type of mmos that is not paid to win where everything is that is exclusive is possible to get if you take the time and hours to farm for it

well 3712hrs on this game isnt much for those warframe pros i recommend this game who loves to play farming games farm farm exp farm every single thing to get those that looks really cool but after so much time spent waiting for foundries i decided to stop just cant stand it anymore lots of new warframe shells are coming and there are only 2 slots given by the game need to buy with real money or sell stuffwelluh yeah pretty much it recommended i have no life after playing this game
recommended
great game worth putting the time and effort into the game gives a different atmosphere of gameplay something that you will want more and more of theres alot of stuff to do ingame you have dojos clans which u can customise fully however you like you also have a handfull of great weapons to choose from and customize at will theres a great community backing the game too also the developers at warframe are very good they are very helpful for whenever you need them eg technical issues and wateva else they bring great content to the game every so month or season like xmas easter and so on while on a certain mission its great just to take your time and look around the map the way they design the map and have all different secret areas for you to xplore and discover is just awsome only down side i have had with the game would be just the lagg some games i join might have crppy internet so it pretty much makes the mission impossible to do cause sometimes you will not see the enemies around you or doors will not open for you but for others it will but those are just minor things everything else is just awesome plus you become a space ninja what more could you ask for d

what to say about this gameive played this for a long timea really long time way back in the beginning of its alpha and its really grown since thenthere are consistant updates that keep everything fresh and new and fastpaced third person shooting brawling that most people would be interested inbut as much as i love this game thats sort of where the bright sides end the game in its nutshellis a huge farmfest thats it you earn mastery rank basically an account level through levelling gear which unlocks missions weapons and gear for you until about rank 7 which as is expected of the community they will look at this and think how they could possible perfect this system and they haveyou farm the same mission over and over again usually either defense you have an objective to defend from oncoming waves or survival you defend yourself from oncoming waves while keeping your oxygen supply up from drops from the enemies and capsules which drop by the time youre aboutsay mastery rank 4 you will be doing the same old thing in the same place the same way and if youre not brainlessly farming xp for a warframe or weapon your farming materials to make another weaponwarframe to farm xp for them on the other hand the farming methods means you get diverse weaponry that you are forced to use instead of clinging to a single weapon like a lifeline and never leaving ituntil you realise just how bad 80% of the weapons arecome on this game has rocket hammers glaives chainsaw whips lightning throwers beamrifles quad barrelled shotguns and yetalmost non of these weapons can by used by the end with the end game rifle being the soma prime next up is warframes and what a selection you get warframes are the classes of the games and there are over 20 to choose from and their abilities differ from creating clones going beserk summoning water tentacles from the floor balls that turn into black holes etc etc but again too bad 70% of them are dwarfed in terms of useability with most highend groups refusing anyone who isnt on the good warframe list and just to prove my point should you get this gamejust count how many times you see a hydroid warframe800 hours and ive legitimately seen 3 hydroids in a game with 22 different warframes at this current time why are only 6 or 7 are viable the paying system is what youd expect from any f2p app the simple pay to make things more convinient take on it with weapons taking 12 hours to craft and warframes taking atleast 35 days to make they are nice to begin with they give you some starting platinum only about enough to pay for the cheapest warframe there is or to increase your warframeweapon slots a couple times i cant complain with it if you have the patience then you wont have to pay a penny its difficult to say how i feel about the developersyes its good that they are coming up with updates on a regular basis that theyre trying to keep things fresh but they have a horrible habit of releasing a new weapon making it overpowered so everyone will buy it and items to upgrade it then nerf it in a weeks time when everyone has got one claiming they were fixing it this wouldnt be a problem if this didnt happen consistantly over the time i played it in conclusion despite these things the gameis oddly fun even with its mindnumbing goals and sneaky tactics to part you with your money and being free to play it wouldnt hurt to try it out and there is some joy in being an overlypowerful space ninja destroying waves of space clonesmerchants or zombies ps this is simply my opinion on the game some of my knowledge on the game is slightly outdated but otherwise this should be fairly accurate

this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

swift and smooth this game will work in almost any computer exceptions applied is totaly worth buying some dlcs the best is that you only have to pay if you want no payment needed to win anything 1010
recommended
ok so this game will be repetitive at the start just a bitbut when you start doing void missions and start getting prime parts the game will open up more also i suggest installing a warframe alert app on your smartphone just beacuse you can miss a lot of good stuf just by not knowing about it i suggest to everybody to try this game and give it a shot

as a beta game or freetoplay i would say its great overall bugs and glitches should be expected throught your gameplay experience and they are not hitting on players too hard though therefore its not overall so bad for the bugs part if you are like me you will always find the bugs funny for the gameplay experience its a werid action game because it combines typical third person shooting games actions with magic power especially after the upcoming update for the parkour20 system although there is some tank type character you still need to play the same mission over and over again aka farming to gain rare mods or rare items to build your ultimate weapons it is similar to how you keep pickaxing and shoveling in minecraft just to build a dream house and if you do not play minecraft it will be just like how you get gold and diamond skins for your guns in cod of course you can pay a lot to purchase items from other players or the prime access another important thing is to join a clan or find some pal to play with it is a coop game you may go solo but it would be too hard to level up because bonus experience points can be gained through playing with other players remember to pay attention to the abilities of every warframe because every character aka warframe has hisher special abilities like nekross desecrate can increase drop rates some of the warframes may not need heavy protection too if you have built it right like limbo playing intelligently will not casuse you any damage at all gaming experience is great but the problem is warframe should start working on creating some exclusive things for players who had hunted a lot of things many new players are just buying every stuff to make themselves fit in the high level or veteran players community this is kind of annoying though they are the people who are supporting the game in a financial way and also there should be more competitive gameplay added to this game maybe a clan war this can make the game more fun but i suppose this cannot be done by looking at the engine and server for now this one will only for the new players the missions and tutorial can be quite confusing it is totally not a good time to start off playing this game right now as there are bunches of new things added to this game just remember do not rely on your primary weapon too much check and try out all your abilities every weapon you can obtain find your favorite set up and play this is my opinion it may not mean a lot but this is the comment i have on this game after playing for a year happy hunting tenno
recommended
one of the only shooters i like because the rpg elements are reasonably compelling some menu items are mouse only but otherwise you can play with a gamepad just pray to the gods of rng with warframe it can take a lot of grinding to get what you want since its typically not a steady stream of predictable rewards but rather a completely random chance of getting a reward based on the roll of the dice cash shop isnt too intrusive you can play without paying easily though if you dont want to look ugly or have barely any inventory space youll want to cough up 5 or 10 usd for some color palletes and inventory spaces

ninjas play free those are the three words i wont forget for a very long time having first began playing warframe at the beginning of open beta back when there were a handful of tilesets the ui was simplistic and generally the game felt so much smaller at some point i grew disillusioned with the game and left it for atleast an entire year looking back now its great to see how much it has grown i returned only a week ago but there is still much work to be done  the title of beta becomes readily apparent when you realise digital extremes has a multitude of undocumented changes and nerfs in their hotfixes as well as glitches and imbalances between many of the titular frames but it is however a thirdperson shooting hackyslashy parkour ninja simulator and one of my favourite games of all time for its intuitive fastpaced and fluid combat which flows brilliantly as one switches from oversized machinegun to pocket laser shotgun to jetpowered hammer the most important question is however is it fun well it certainly has its flaws for newer players itll be an uphill struggle since you wont be all too familiar with it youll have to really farm for some of your gear and sometimes rngesus will kick you in the balls there are some annoying enemies too like grineer manics who zip around and teleport constantly or nullifiers who remove your warframes buffs when you enter their shields my answer yes play this bloody game give it a chance  after all digital extremes had this baby from the getgo this is what darksector was supposed to be

and heres my book warframe one of the most popular online fps rpgs on the market today warframe has already collected quite the crowd three million is the current lastpublished number for the player base of this game with online guide support one is never lost in this game as it is constantly changing created by digital extremes de this game is nothing short of constantly updated if you ever find a bug or that something isnt correct you can guarantee that it wont be the situation for long if youre not too big on pc gaming anyway just buy it for ps4 releasing nov 15 2013 in the us oh wait i didnt mention that the game is absolutely free if its not your cup of tea no problem you simply delete it off of your hard drive and your out of nothing but your time however if you do enjoy this game like the many others who tried it youll be sucked into the universe or solar system more correctly of the tenno now dont think this game has some magical gripping storyline the missions are extremely repetitive and somewhat lackluster however the amount of content available is simply astonishing i have at this current time 196 hours of time played in warframe i still feel as if i havent scratched the surface if youre worried about spending money you shouldnt worry at all if you want to play this game in the sub100 hours range then you should be fine if not i would say $50$75 should complete the entire purchase of the game considering the fact that fallout 3 plus all its dlc was $120 im not too concerned on that price range if youre interested of hours of addictive gameplay filled with ninja robots and a whole lot of dead people youve come to the right place fight on tenno

my computer has cancer it cannot run this game because there is a rule about the game that says those who have cancer cannot play warframe it was not my fault i downloaded free ram to increase my computers sexual performance and it stopped working i eventually deleted system 31 and it began to work

i only played a little bit its alright
recommended
nicei really love it

this is a remarkable game with outstanding graphics you get to customize your appearance and choose your weapon loadout
recommended
a game with outstanding diversity going from a challanging pain in the  stealth game to an all out intense shooter warframe has an old school approach to its gameplay style while offering a fairly unique story and artistic vision there is enough diversity in this game to interest almost anyone looking for some action it even blends the lines of arcade and grindathon quite nicely meaning you get a real sence of reward for your efforts though many early levels are easy enought to simply blast through youll be challanged later in game where stealthing is priceless and raw combat must be met with preparation most of which will be done using the games vast customisation options to polish your playstyle its not for everyone but its free so deffo worth the try

it a great game for people who like spaceninjas and guns

im a fan of the muliplayer fps mmo and rpg scenes i love the idea of an fps in a diablo suit but i was worried it would be too repetitive would the replayability be there the answer a circumstantial yes i would highly reccomend that you play this game with friends if you are solo the game can quickly become tedious however with friends time flies by something else that is not readily apparent  there is a somewhat steep learning curve to this game understanding how mods interact with polarity slots how damage is calculated various weaknesses and strengths and learning all the warframes really what style of play suits you can be a daunting task new players will find the first system of missions easy enough but will soon find enemies that prove a real challenge the correct application of mods on your warframe and weapons will be essential all in all digital extremes is putting in a great deal of work into making this game an amazing experience updates are constant its free to play with an ingame store for both normal currency and paid currency everything that can be bought with real money can also be obtained without real money except extra inventory space and a few cosmetics and without too much difficulty try it out  what have you got to lose

i would recomend this game for people who enjoy playing grindier games its quite the time sinker if you like it to be always thinking about what is the next step what weapons you should be leveling up and modding as you get more into it you will expand and build you own kind of gameplay with you own set of favourit warframe  and there are quite a lot to choose from  i would recomend also to be a few people playing it as a team as it enhance the experience and makes it easier to achive goals that contributes to you own agenda
recommended
the game is centred around a group of space ninjas or tenno who aim to maintain some form of balance in the galaxy they are lead by a mysterious being known only as the lotus in their task each tenno is able to equip a warframe or battle suit to use in their fight they each have their own abilities strengths and weaknesses the game has a slow start but does get better with the aquisition of new weapons and warframesmost of the game is based around improving your gear and weapons and there is pvp if you want to compare with friends the story is still unfolding in the game so it may seem very subtle but the actions you perform do have an impact even if it is just a minor one  good gameplay  varied weapons and warframesabilities  varied maps and enviroments  slow to start  can feel grind heavy for free to play players 810 would play for hours
recommended
the game is a great mix of third person shooter with space ninjas and elements of rpg games like wow and guild warsin terms od weapon and character customization overall i will sugest this game to everyone who want to have a lot of fun with over the top shooter and doesnt want to pay a lot of moneyyou will need to spend some time if u dont want to spend money at all 910

similar to global agenda lots of fun & something different

all i have to say is ninjas in spaaacceeee the american servers are a bit slow so be patient other than that i give it 7 outta 10
recommended
after playing for a ridiculous amount of time ive concluded that its probably one of the most engaging games i have played
recommended
i would have loved this game if you didnt have to pay for so many things like more weapons or other characters it would have been fine with some really great stuff that you have to pay for but it seems like its everything other than that it is a pretty great game there is a story coop choose which levels you do first this game would have been my number 1 if it wasnt for all the money you had to pay to get stuff
recommended
cool game
recommended
its ok
recommended
ninjas in space ohh them crazy ninjas getting into mischief over all amazing game
recommended
game is amazing ive been playing since it was in it was a beta and its just been growing and growing theres all sorts of varierity of warframe characters and weapons to chose from theres decorations for your ship pets as in kubrows dog creatures and sentienels robots the game is just amazing in every way in my opinion but i wouldnt suggest this game to players if you dont plan on being active because all though it is free to play you have to grind for you better gear unless you plan on spending money on the game
recommended
very glitchey after update i cant even get on properly any more cool game do
recommended
i love this game it is fun interactive and always changing they are allways bringing more and more into the game there are of course faults such as an abudance of glitches but even still the dev group fixes them when the users find the glitches the semi realism of each use of the blade upon the eneimies is well done and the bullets and arrows or even status affects are all reacted to by the enemies overall an amazing criminally free game
recommended
good game keeps things interesting with events and different circumstances they constantly bring out and constant updates to weaponry and activites make this a very good game to play key features and the best parts are the variety of weaponry and modification and the warframes themselves negative features are the maps themselves have clearly copied and pasted areas once you see 23 rooms in a map youve seen it all of that template all in all fun game with friends ive wasted so many hours myself on it but what would make it perfect is new maps that arent full of copy and pasted areas and a new race other than the corpus or grineer and the infected mix it up   well 1000 hours later in the game there are some things that need to be said de the devs have a bad habit of ignoring bugs and glitches and visually unfinished models that they implement into the game and make decisions based on how much plat they will make out of the game if you find a farming method that is anywhere near effective it will be nerfed if you find a system that works it will be changed if you find anything that makes you feel good they will usually take it away im not speaking personally on this but all the decisions de has made make it painfully clear that they are only interested in how much you pay up i mean fair enough but sometimes they make one too many wrong decisions and  a lot of people off they dont think about their fixes they dont understand repurcussions or the what their fixes do to the rest of the populace also they just released jarjar binks as a warframe lmao enough said there
recommended
if you havent played this game you are seriously missing out guns technoish ninja robots various kinds of missions weapons enemys and loot and it keeps growing even better its free to play  you can get pretty much everything in the game without buying in game currency this game is going to be huge so get in on the action now
recommended
this game is aweome
recommended
while the game is still in beta clearly evident witht the lack of anything endgame esk it still is a fun and challenging experience the game utilizes many creative game machanics and unique character lookspowers there is a constant update of new weapons added weekly to give players something new to build and the devs are constantly looking to the community to improve the game one step at a time this gives the game an impressive evolution that can dramicically alter the game from one udate to the next improving on the areas that the player base thinks there should be improvments
recommended
one of my alltime favorite games no its not everyons cup of tea the game is focused entirely on 4 player coop with an amazing art and design style the fastpaced and largely enjoyable gunplayswordplay combo all in one package yes it can get grindy but a large part of the fun is going out and crafting all the various weapons from a multitude of components and resources you find while fighting varying enemies currently 4 main enemy factions corpus robotsshied focused grineer cloned humanarmor focused infected biotechnocyte virus general zergish focused and corrupted  a mix of the previous 3 with a few twists  each faction has its major weaknesses and strengths so you will never be facing hordes of the same enemy over and over there are a huge number of varying enemies to fight and places to go in the solar system the overarching storyline is slowly being fleshed out by the devs and its quite interesting certainly not the runofthemill and the suppsoed protaganists you the tenno are not always acting in the best interests of humanity as a whole so the player can choose all rp for now anyway your role in the powder keg that is the solar system in the timeframe the game is set thousands of years from now tldr  many different space ninjas with badass guns and swords that is all

let me start by saying that this is a free game that has in game purchases weapons warframes storage slots etc let me continue with this is one of the best games i have ever played in my life i am an avid gamer for more than 18 years now and have played hundreds of games of all genres this free game is mindblowing in many ways 1 it is free 2 it is not that kind of a free game where someone who makes in game purchases will have an enourmous advantage over you the advantage is only in the fact that he will have more warframes and wapons because storage is limited and you can purchase more you level at the same speed the prime warframes are only 1015% better then the normal ones same goes for prime weapons 3 the game does not require you to pay to get 100% out of it you can aquire all weapons and all warframes including prime by earning them through playing 4 the graphics are brilliant a beautifully designed game 5 playability is 150% at least for me love the mechanics love the skillsets love the weapons for a free game you could not wish for more 6 robot ninjas with superpowers enough said 7 awsome mod skilltree simillar to rpg style but here you collect mods upgrade them and fit them into your warframes weapons and companions little robots with laser beams killer hounds and simmilar the best thing is you need to pick different mods for different misions because they are very specialized there is no best mod for all missions and against all types of enemies there are a few drawbacks 1 the lore story is somewhat shallow altough it is so far very well thought of 2 the missions tend to be somewhat repetitive but using different warframes weapons and playing with different coop players makes it interesting time and time again 3 that is all i can currently think of all in all this is a must try game i have personally invested over 300 hours in it and i havent had enough cheers

best description of what playing warframe feels like take a needle full of some form of mentally disorienting drug and shoot a whole needle into your body day after day all you can do is wonder what you are doing or if it has any meaning but you just keep going since it falsely brings you satisfaction

amazing game it constantly adds new weapons and operations get it if you love fun parkour shooters and ninjas

this is actually a good tps nice weapons nice skills and habilities you can play it solo or multiplayer but this game dude this game it breaks everything regions are weird england connected to russia the ia is buggy sometimes you die for no valid reason the voting system is actually not a voting system etc still an awesome game you should try it ps  if you want new weapons open up your wallet or spend 20 hours in farming almost pay2win
recommended
easy to play easy to get hooked repetitive gameplay not pay to win but the reminder of what you could have for just a bit more $$ is constant you cant get away from it if you ever saw the simpsons episode where mr burns is draging money on the street from behind his limothats a lot like warframe not everyone will or needs to put real money into the game to some extent i hope most people pitch in a small part to support the devs as this is a good game but be careful i personally have put more real money into this game than what i would for preordering most aaa games and while it does pay off it doesnt come anywhere close to unlocking everything in the game the upside of that is that the game keeps churning out new weapons to use new gamemodes to play new enimes to shoot or slice new warframes to use in battle and new gameplay expeirences overall pretty sure they make new graphics improvements as well warframe is a great looking game that is constantly trying to evolve itself the controls are solid and the gunplay can be satisfying so long as your at the right level for your frame and weaponry speaking of weaponry there is quite a bit here everything from scifi lasers to war hammers bows assult rifles axes whips and much more each of these are leveled up and can be modded for increased effect same goes for the warframes themselves imo this is there warframe hooks people there are so many options of warframes and weapons to use its astounding this game keeps giving you little goodies like mods and credits for each mission and eventually youll have enough to upgrade your equipment or purchase something new which starts the process all over again if youre looking for in depth story you might want to look elseware there is a backstory for sure but it is barely noticeable compared to the addictive cycle of leveling up fighting obtianing new equipment and leveling up again what story is there i do enjoy and i believe digital extremes keeps giving little tid bits of story to progress the game the game play is fun but after a while it gets old for most people i do know some have kept at the cycle for a while and have came up with some very impressive builds but i dont see myself doing that good thing is that theres still plenty of gameplay to be had for us more casual players all in all i dont regret the money or time i spent on the game but the cycle is something that needs to be pointed out

a really good game if you like those metal gearesqe gray fox ninjas except with a lot less sneaking and more slicing people into pieces the game has microtransactions for some interesting cosmetic things and much of the unlockable content however most all of the equipment from primary weapons to the warframe you play as are unlockable via playing the game and getting the parts to build it its not paytowin its paytosavetime in defense of the grinding it doesnt take long at all to get all the good stuff once you get used to the game and the mechanics

great everlasting game 9 out of 10 full of multiple factions characters powers you name it enough to keep one active for a long while but some can get reptitive but with constant updates changing the game and adding content i personally am expecting the repetition to deteriorate over time also the fact that the community is really friendly and informing that the devs pay attention and take suggestions from too

ive been playing this game for about two weeks and my impression so far is mixed though mostly positive if you like the concept of being a space ninja and dont mind the grinding that goes with most mmos then this game is for you so far im still relatively inexperienced and avoid the trading channel like the plague honestly while a community market is always a plus the sheer wall of text of stuff you dont care about is hard to sift through in order to find people sellingbuying the stuff you do care about also the game seems to suffer from a diablostyle you need this gear on this class otherwise dont bother me mentality when it comes to highlevel missions perhaps its a spoiled community or perhaps its the apathy that comes with farming i cant say apart from these two glaring communitybased problems id say the game is superb there are occasional bugs falling through the map not being able to interact with the ui but they can be worked around as a f2p it blasts its competitors out of the water holding its own against similar aaa titles the weapons are varied and most are suited for specific occasions and playstyles like to snipe there are sniper rifles and compound bows like mowing down enemies with a hail of bullets try the soma wanna get up close and personal i cant recommend the valkyr frame highly enough as her ultimate ability renders her invulnerable with the only drawback being a restriction to melee attacks which regenerate her health want to customize your frame there are several mods which alter your abilities as well as paint and accessory customization options at your disposal my recommendation for people looking to try this game  download it give it a whirl its free to play so its not like youll be missing out on anything by trying it i recommend starting with the excalibur warframe as it turns out quite handy even in later missions there are lots of weapons and mods that were only accessible for certain events but a lot of them are often sold on the player market most of the gear youll need can be won through ingame missions though it may take a significant amount of time for those of you who dont mind spending a bit of extra cash platinum will be your best friend in quickly acquiring equipment which would normally take days of grinding to find for those of you whod rather keep your cash and play entirely free youll spend a lot of time trying to farm specific areas for parts to craft your new toys but itll be that much more satisfying once you have them i cant recommend this game highly enough it has its flaws sure but for what started as an indie freetoplay its come a long way the game is still regularly updated the devs are usually quick to fix major bugs and you can finally live the dream of becoming space rambo whats not to love

this game is really fun and enjoyable alot of fun doing missons its so cool i give it 810 3 join in the fun d

its better then cod and its like halo 710 lol its like space ninja police force its good game lots of weapons warframes swords and eemeys but it take forever to get weapons and sword or warframe then it tkae 24 days just to make it

warframe you play as a fricken space ninja with gunsbowsgreande launchersswoards hammersaxes and even more and it have very nice combat but i lost intrest quite quickly because at the later levels it become a grind festbut there is a level capbut then you get bored of the warframe any go farm for 5 hours to get the buildprints the fram even more for the resourcese then you have to wait 12 hour for 3 parts to build then 3 days for an acutal warframe overall this game is fun with friends but it just gets boring after a while the score for this game is 610

great gime that i would highly reccomend it has so much content so there is always something to do
recommended
warframe is a mix of tps and a slasher game set in our solar system it has great graphisc nice music and it is fun there are some bugs thou and its free you dont have to pay anything unless you want to get more warframes  you get 2 spaces with one of them occupied  some decorative stuff or youre just plain lazy

one of the best ftp game ive played  but it gets a little boring after awhile
recommended
this game is simply brilliant i think i should start of by saying this game really is f2p although you can buy platinum the ingame currency and buy nearly everything with that apart from a few cosmetics you can earn everything through playing the game the story is something as of the time im writing this is lacking there is not much of an explanation for anything however this is made up for by the fact the gameplay is simply amazing gameplaywise you start of on the planet mercury and although people can taxi you to much higher levels you normally have to make your way through the planets to unlock more missions then once youre in a mission you can play a variety of styles you can go stealthy not being seen and stealth attacking the helpless corpus and grinner the enemies you could go for the noncaring style sprinting through the mission avoiding all fire or you could go brute force tearing your way through everything and everyone overral even though lacking in story its a brilliant game so considering its freetoplay why not download it
recommended
one of the best f2p games ive ever plaid
recommended
some people have been saying this game is p2w and on a very basic level it is but keep reading essentially i could go in with 200 play 2030hrs and have maxed out all of the best equipment in the game  or i could pay absolutely nothing and have hundreds of hours of one of the most fulfilling challenging and exciting coop experiences on steam every hour i spent grinding paid off well and i didnt feel daunted by the hours of gameplay as there are plenty of levels to choose from tonnes of bosses and a great community building a new warframe was exciting and well worth the hours of gameplay and downtime it takes to gather resources and build i have almost 100hrs into the game and i still feel like i could play 1000 more and still have more motives to play devs are great and are constantly adding new weapons missions and frames to keep the game fresh 1010 only problem is that it destroyed my social life

very fun at first can get repetive with the grind pvps a little akward with the conclave system newer updates are kind of hard to pick up if you dont stay with the game but overall really fun 9510

based on 10 hours of gameplay  great graphics  ninjas  lot of replayability  fun especially with friends  fair business model  grindy some people like grinding like me some dont  graphics can be a bit demanding  soloing can get challenging at times great game definitely give it a try
recommended
the game has good graphics but the hosting of matches needs some major overhaul

its rare i come across a game that makes me want to play it every opportunity i get i have always liked games with a grinding factor to them graphics  quite nice and nicely optimised replayability is that a word  replay this  as much as you like theres always something you benefit from community  generally it has a really nice community ninja stealth kills  it has plenty of those selling point of the game um you can ing fly kick someones face in 2112

game is fun and looks great but missions can get repetitive has a fair share of bugs lots of weapon options character customization and warframes make this game a fantastic free to play

warframe warframe ive spent alot of hours playing this game and i can safely say that its extremely funny like many other games warframe is far from perfect but its unique coop style combat and generally its concept makes it stand out while i could go on a talk about every aspect of the game ill try to keep it short pros enjoyable farm for me atleast i have never farmed in a single game to give you an idea i used to sell my extra epics in vanilla wow just to take flight paths i think this could illustrate that i really didnt farm i can vouch that warframe farming has another element to it maybe because the combat its fun great combat warframe is a great 3rd person action shooter you can also inflict pain by using melee weapons multiple weapons there are literally about 200 different weapons in the game at the moment all of them which you can purchase from the store with in game cash aka credits which are easily acquired or for other weapons farm the components different types of missions which all have specific goals if you dont like a mission type and dont really need anything from it its pretty straightforward do not do it pvp while unbalanced its still really funny and by no means mandatory it can be seen as another type of mission great coop game if not the best ive played i wont compare it with games such as broforce or castlecrashers cons  and i really hate saying that  zero endgame if you ever get to farm all of the frames and weapons you want max them etc well theres really no one to use them on the tower 4 missions are considered to be the lategame even there you have to wait 40mins or 40waves in order to get somewhat of a challenge and if the whole group is skilled you will have to wait even more bugs game is not filled with but has some bugs which grow tiresome after a while most common would be having an enemy that goes underground and you having no chance of killing him if you dont have some sort of rocket launcher or spell that will hit anything close unbalanced like pretty much every other game warframe sense of balance is broken out of the 200 weapons i mentionned above well they are pretty much all useless except of course the small list of guns that are completely op compared to their brethren about 15 maybe 20 guns masteryrank while i really liked that system it proved to be nothing else but numbers rising after reaching mr 8 you can have every weapon i think aside from that well its not really rewarding to level up you have to constantly craft new weapons and level them up being myself rank 11 i surely like seeing the number but i feel like theres no much more to it future orientation of course i do not know where the game is headed but i started playing somewhere in july the developpers where already saying that endgame would be included ive seen some cool reworks being done new aspects of the game being created new missions that are about space combat however end game has still not been included storywise while warframe does seem to have a story line we know very little about it which is a shame as i even downloaded a really crappy game to get an idea of wf story the game was dark sector friendly advice  do not download dark sector chat system & ui i dont even know where to begin with noob unfriendly fortunately for me i started out the game with alot of friends and we already had friends which were high leveled and everything was explained if i were to startout this game alone i probably would have seen only the first planet conclusion even though the cons are important the game is still awesome and kicks  i really hope the developers realize that they have a great game and that they could easily make it one of the best games with the addition of minimal stuff really i really recommend this game 810 yeah

a great game ive been playing since founders beta and i myself am a founder however i havent been playing this as much as i used to mostly because as time goes by i feel like this game isnt catered for me at all dont get me wrong its still fun and i still recommend it its mostly a personal thing i like games where i feel like its my character that im sticking into the game i want to feel like i can build and play it the way i want in a game like warframe though youre given the characters classes with very little customization options and while there may be some argument in reality theres only a few viable builds unless youre content with staying with the really low level missions if you can get past that this game has fun fast action and a lot of different kinds of missions and different maps randomly generated to some extent a decent community and a lot of fun stuff to buy if youre the type that likes to spend real money on games like me
recommended
this is most likely one of the best 20142015 games there arelots of content and constantly adding more while fixing the small bugs or things theydont like along the way big thumbs up to the community best ive seen in yearspolar opposite of the cs go onepeople are generaly really nice and helpfull give it a try see you on the battlefield

warframe is not without its shortcomings with regards to skillgap balance and friendliness to novice players but its also hugely entertaining de have absolutely nailed that just one more mission loop when you find a group of players who work as a team or just a friendly player to partner up with for story missions it can be absolutely thrilling survival missions where each teammember works to help others while fending off wave after wave of enemies is a total rush when you pull off some impossible feat of swordgunbased acrobatics it is gratifying like few other games on the other hand there is a considerable skillgap get beyond the initial public missions and you will often find people playing the game at a level of skill and speed that renders novice players little more than a burden there are also a baffling amount of systems and upgrade trees to navigate upgrades have upgrades theres definitely a part of me that likes the fact that in a lot of ways its very unabashedly hardcore but i would certainly caution new players that it requires a level of dedication they might not be willing to give but if you like the sound of spaceninjas pulling off improbable feats of death acrobatics against hordes of enemies that look like they were the product of tsutomu niheis fever dreams and youre prepared to put in the hours to learn how to master the games myriad systems then i totally recommend you pick this up and spend a few bucks in the store addendum for those worried about the f2p aspect spending a bit of money will save you a lot of pain and grind but you can absolutely play this game and have a thoroughly good time without spending a penny it is not a paytowin scenario
recommended
this is the only free to play game i will ever play but the recent updates have been giving me bad frame rate 
recommended
do you like war do you like frames well in frame maker 2015 awesome mega ultra edition youll be making all the picture frames you could ever want then you can fill them with war pictures but nothing else picture frame weekly said exebeastingtastic fun for just you not the family ive stolen this quotecom said exebeastingtastic fun for just you not the family last time i played this is was good fun so im trying it again woot woot
recommended
its ok after the first 1600 hours of grinding through you start to wonder if other games should be played instead not to say warframe is a bad game but i spent probably 500$ total on the game and played the same levels 1000 times over its essentially the coolest character customization and power based game ive ever played with a very high skill cap and timed waiting build times for everything some reach up to 3 days to get to late game content unless you have some money with the downfall of having sub par repeating tileset based levels the idea of it is ok and will not become repetitive until about 100 hours in max but overall this is what you can expect from warframe pros amazing easy to do indepth character customization large amount of weapons large variety of weapons seriously theres a freeze gun in this solid upgradeleveling system fun and epic character abilities easy to play with friends active community forums devs will read posts in forums to help improve the game detailed and informative wiki page updates from devs via stream everything non asthetic is available to get with ingame currency cons long wait times for items eg guns warframes keys blueprints to build with the exception of real money to rush it repetitive levels youll play the same level you did on the first planet as you will on the last planet with the exception of higher level enemies not pay to win but if you want to look cool in anyway youre going to be paying for platnium paid currency very grindy seriously if you dont like grind games look somewhere else poor pvp balancing and gameplay overall its worth downloading and checking out i have been playing since patch 20 almost 3 years ago and i think this game has the potential to be aaa status if they remake the map and planet system
recommended
good game  enjoy it very much
recommended
this is an awesome game and its ing free in my opinion this is by far the best free to play experience ive had the pleasure of gracing essentially you can get everything in game without spending a penny of real dosh the gameplay itself is very free flowing smooth and lets you do a lot more like climb the environment do parkour crouch or slide around the map overall its a unique and fun game to play that bears resemblance to mass effect this game is still in beta and has a lot more potential that it can muster up in my opinion 810
recommended
at first i looked at this game and thought ehh to much alien looking stuff for me but man was i wrong this game is amazing and i would recommend it even though ive only got 4 hours on record i can see many more coming

recommended
great game beautiful graphics for a free game if you love fast paced gameplay this is perfect for you but some miner points if you dont have a lot of time you might not be able to get the frame you want because this is a grinding game that doesnt bother me at all but if you want something you will be able to get it but you will have to wait a bit all in all would give this 9510 because the game is still in closed beta and theres still some bugs the most are minors
recommended
ninjas space ninjas what more do you expect me to say

its good

scavenging shiny robots fast paced universal combat itll get you hooked i have friends who play this endlessly and after joining all the hype i dont regret it if youve ever played the borderlands series youd get a slight feel for it when you notice all of the mods ammo packs etc flooding the ground this game really immerses you into several atmospheres for those who like to take it slow can go for stealth approaches in levels adding a booming level of intensity patience is key so be careful not to get caught then there is the tanking aspect if you want to get a mission done quick ring in your fastest and heaviest fire power because youll have hordes of enemies on you starting out though try not to get too intimidated i recommend tuning into the the storyline as it can help a whole lot bring an experienced friend a long to help getting confused and put off is easy as a lot of the game aspects fly right by you pretty quick overall this game is great you have a long way to go before you end up getting bored because the variety will take you on so many experiences 810

what can i say this spaceninja based game caught my eye and life playing with friends hasnt been more fun running through different instances such as spaceships devastated debris fields ancient ruins all with one purpose cutting off infested zombielike creatures robotic grineers or energy wielding humans and blowing everything up with each different warframe unique and epic ability with a huge arsenal of weapon variety different mods to customize your playstyle accordingly for each frame makes the posibilities endless although it sometimes can get repetitive like power leveling farming and non stop killing theres this thing that keeps warframe so good over the years the constant and nonstop updates and events from the developers de fun with friends get three teammates and have a great laugh killing everything on sight if you like mayhem you got it
recommended
this is one of my personal favorite free to play games on steam amazing gameplay great storyline and intense fights i like this game because it isnt one of the endless mindless first person shooters but actually can maintain both storyline and hype recomended for anyone
recommended
now that over a thousand hours of my life have gone into this game as well as a good chunk of cash i can really give this a better review in short its fun but doesnt feel like its going in the direction it shouldor that i would like i dont really know how to describe my feelings for it after ui 20 it just wasnt as much fun i was rank 16highest you could be at the time and had every weapon i could obtain except for 3 and then new ones came and then more and more sure this is how warframe has been but for some reason it just wasnt as fun some of the new weapons now look fun but during that time i couldnt get back into it i will say that if you come across this review and havent played yet get the game its amazing when you fist start out as you have so many weapons and warframes to choose from and of course its a grindfest so if youre into that then you will be fine i hope you enjoy this game and maybe youll see it finally get releasedcorpusgrineer

an epic scifi action packed with supercharged high tech space ninjas superpowers akimbo hand shotguns and more awesome weaponry warframe is a nonstop superfun game think of it as a futuristic left4dead added with the capability of parkour if this game didnt have weaponarmoraccessory blueprints it would be almost impossible to upgrade your arsenal and would feel like as if youve been ripped off by some cheesy ipad fremium game which for me would only be the downside of the game i would definitely recommend this to all the players who love coop shooters
recommended
this game is free it rocks
recommended
3 words  best game ever additional more words  why do you still not have this game 3 best game ive ever played but the bad part is the mission can be pretty repetitive but overall its amazing 1110 p just get this game xd
recommended
warframe micro transactions that save your life lets all be honest here microtransactions are the bain of all gamers and this game takes the absolute  when it comes to them you want to get that class pay 10 and another 370 in individual packs to get it when it comes to gameplay however this game pulls back some good boy points for the addictive hack n slash aspect of running around with a huge battleaxe swinging faster than the wheels on a ferrari going top speed this game will take hours of your life away when crafting a new weapon or a class this game takes the royal f low level weapons unsorted weapons 12h popular weapons 24h classes 3 motherf days timers like that are not healthy for a game to survive also it forces the player to think i should really spend some money so i dont have to wait 3 days for this new class despite my constant playing of the game getting a blazing 420 hours this game disappoints me with build times 610
recommended
warframe is by far my favorite game i recommand this game to any gamer that enjoys fast action and an insane lvling system 
recommended
all i have to say is this if it looks fun or semi fun to you give it a try however if it looks like its not you kind of thing or that it doesnt look fun then hey you dont have to download it personaly i had fun with it i wouldnt say its one of the best f2p  free to play for those of you that dont know  but i hade fun with it

an epic scifi hackandslash shoot em up with an indepth customization and leveling system along with a myriad of locations to go to build up your character the movement combat and sword play is very fluid enemies give just enough challenge this game has plenty of content plus its free to play so there is no loss to not liking it xd
recommended
basically a free to play version of destiny that came out before destiny if you want a game thats fast paced & easy to play and doesnt take allot of grind time to enjoy it then its worth the free install but it is a typical console run and gun with a shinny appearance to hide the lacking of progressive storyline or variance in gameplay
recommended
the graphics r amazing for f2p

if you love level grinding and loot farming this is the game for you can be repetitive at times but overall very fun when you have friends to compete with

update 5112015 with over 300 hours logged most from the beginning phases of the game in beta and a break in between 22014 to now i can say with full confidence that the game has taken a 360 degree turn in the right direction the sheer amount of material that is available now and the improvements are not small and are not something to shy away from this game hold the title in my eyes as the number 1 freetoplay coop game and the number 1 freetoplay tps game for folks who are returning to the game from back in early 2014 it will take a nice while to get used to the new interfaces modifications and ways of playing the game but once you get used to it it works perfectly and even better and more fulfilling than before have fun tenno first review feb 2014 once you get into it its ing addictive like my buddy morker said its mindless fun

by far one of my favorite free to play games of all time yes like any free to play game it can get a bit repetitive but at the same time it has a lot of diversity if you so choose to allow it to have some not only does this game constantly update meaning you will always have a bit of new content to play around with but it also supports several different play styles in the four man teams the game brings together whether youre playing with a bunch of friends making new friends in random matches or just playing like a lone wolf this game will be sure to entertain you for quite a bit
recommended
ii cant stop playing best free to play model in existence probably one of the only games out there where you honestly dont have to spend any money all the warframes weapons and mods can be gained without spending any money at all the community is great and there is always someone willing to help new content is being added on a nearly weekly basis the gameplay is what really shines though the shooting mechanics melee mechanics and how you traverse the maps parkour are some of the best the shooter genre has to offer
recommended
i suggest playing with friends trying to grind by yourself gets a bit boaring after 4 hours of game play but its f2p and has one of the greatest graphics i ever saw on a f2p game definately worth checking out

i have recently discovered warframe but ive been completely hooked ever since if you are uncertain what this game is supposed to be its very much like an mmorpg in a lot of respects but missions are played with teams of 4 you do have your farming grinding and classes for example but warframe does a lot of things differently and i really like all these differences with more traditional mmos for example the combat has some parkour thrown into it it has hordes and hordes of enemies you have to lay waste to and with the abilities the characters aka warframes have you can freshen up the gameplay just by picking another weapon or frame which is another great thing about this game there are plenty of completely viable yet different weapons and warframes and you can easily switch between the ones you have whenever you are not in a mission and all weapons can be farmed for fair and square there is not pay to win there another thing is that instead of having a world with npcs and quests warframe has a solar map you can use to instantly select the mission you want to play that means less meaningless questing to keep you busy and more tothepoint farming for what you need to me that keeps the game meaningful although this means less story and possibly less immersion it does prevent having to do boring backtracking and fetching quests just to progress in the questline you are just transported to the action instantly and as soon as it ends you are back in your ship and ready for more action never a dull moment but of course this game is free to play and we all know how bad that can be in the case of warframe id say the pay to play is fair enough but it could be better for example there is no way to get extra slots for warframes and weapons besides using the paid currency platinum and youll absolutely need that space in order to play the game now i know a few players who havent spent a penny and still managed to get the platinum by trading with other players but with the current trading system that requires immense effort and is very very frustrating the trade chat is a mess and trading requires you to memorize the parts you have try and keep up with tradechat and then heading to a special place in order to exchange a maximum of 4 items per trade its needlessly complicated so i spend around 5 bucks a month in order to get my slots and potatoes which is quite reasonable considering the sheer amount of updates this game receives but be aware that actually playing for free will be limiting and frustrating which brings me to point three the updates the reason i spend 5 bucks a month is that in return the game gets updated incredibly often in order to keep veteran players interested it is necessary to release all sorts of timelimited offers for rare loot events for rarer loot expensive timelimited hardtoget endgame content and updates with new warframes and weapons so warframe gets tons of updates from the devs and frequent updates are the core of a lively community and that brings me to another positive point about this game the community and the devs digital extremes de for short is legendary besides giving frequent content updates de keeps in touch with their community through wellwatched streams on twitch every single week one on thursday for fun and giggles and one on friday where they talk about everything de is working on this transparency is why de is very liked by the community the streams give you a good idea of what the personal motivations of the devs is and there is a lot of respect going on between de and the players which is very good and ive never seen anything like this from a reasonably big company like de and because warframe is 100% coop i found that the community is helpful and respectful as a new player instead of being kicked out and looked down upon i was helped by more experienced players as soon as i asked a question and when i had difficulty getting a rare item random players would sometimes just give it to me so with the devs and players all being very respectful the game has a nice atmosphere going on which i enjoy so all in all my only concern with warframe is that there is some content that is locked behind a paywall the good news is that you can get around that the bad news is that its pretty hard but nonetheless the game is hugely enjoyable the community is one of the best ive seen and the game is very much alive and sprawling with content more being added almost weekly certainly worth your time id say
recommended
its like destiny but free and better
recommended
it turned me from atheist to religious hail rngsus

warframe is in a league of its own not only because of how good it is now but how good it will be everytime you look away from this game they have crazy patches and events and as such i will always recommend this game
recommended
i will like to recommend this game to everyone  this game have some reality dat i have never expected 
recommended
this game is fun the updates takes to long and ii dont know why they would add a box after you press play cus sometimes the box freezes but gameplay looks awesome
recommended
this is a great game
recommended
honestly with it being still in beta i am massively impressed by the brilliant graphics great gameplay sick weapons and skins the being able to not be paytowin and most of all by the best community that i have ever seen in any mmo ever i already played this game so much and i hope that i will maintain playing this amazing game
recommended
great game 1010

literally and without question the most fun and intense free to play cooperative game ever
recommended
fast pace game good looking visuals and customizations friendly community game is always up to date they keep there fans up to date
recommended
warframe in my opinion it is just too amazing to be free and i mean for gods sake youre a space ninja whats not to love about that and another thing it have a great and helpful community involved in it plus its a really great game to play with friends
recommended
ok so my friend is engrossed by this game so i got it to see what the hype was about i got it and played about 2 hours then quit let me tell you at first this game is very slow and semi hard to play due to the crap starter weapons and melee options not to mention the fact that i picked the widley excepted worst starter but after that 4 hour mark and a few missions grinding it out to get that gun i really wanted i started to have fun the point of the matter is you have to work at the beginning to have a great and fun game experience as you can see i still have more hours to put in so this review is not concrete because the game is always getting updates which is a great thing adding in new things such as the new stances that give the game sort of a fighting game aspect with the various combos pros graphics are great for a free game if you play with friends you will have fun so great coop oh yeah its a free game so why not cons i would be lying if i told you the gameplay was not repetitive you have to grind like crazy to get what you want if you dont have fun at first try the game with friends
recommended
best game in the world wellto me at least i adore this game  u  <3
recommended
this game is free it rocks
recommended
please understand before skipping this review because i only have 7 hours logged that i played this long before i even knew steam existed it might as well be a seperate game from the one i started playing but it has stayed just as good if not improved over the years the graphics are nice even at the lowest settings allowing the ability to play a nice looking game without lagging the gameplay while slightly overwhelming at first is fluid and makes you feel like a boss you can play however you want from being sneaky and evading your foes or rushing headstrong into a horde of grineer with your sword so every player plays their own game additionaly every warframe and weapon changes that style for example i main limbo on my steam who differs greatly from my old excalibur instead of sword skills limbo can manipulate the void to his will and transport his friends foes and even himself into the rift between the void and reality every single warframe has awesome abilities like that the customization is awesome and once you have a clan it gets that much better this game is a masterpiece a blend of assassins creed dark souls kotor halo destiny and god knows what else its free go give it a shot you will love it
recommended
good game if you dont mind repetitive grinding
recommended
i do not know why this game is free but im not complaining their loss is our gain

amazing game but reqires alot of grinding and pvp could be improved upon
recommended
see that trailer video you actually can do that you play a space ninja third person shootystabby game with mmo powers on top worth playng especially since its free so its been about a year since dedigital extremes started talking about coming out of open beta theyve yet to do so i still think the game can be fun for a while but theres just no content after a certain point what story is there is interesting and theres a ton of potential but the game itself just has not improved where it should have the new uis are also awful consoleish monstrosities that make it harder to get around to what you need when its a solid 610 mmo game with an amazing art group the game looks very good it even plays pretty wellbugs aside it just has zero staying power youll play for three weeks stop for six months come back and play a week or two to get hte new shinies then quit again
recommended
grinding on top of grinding rolled up in grinding yet it is by far my favorite game in a long time it features a multitude of weapons and warframes that suit any play style from stealth to tanking although it is a f2p game with 2 currencies a multitude of weapons can be crafted from blueprints either purchased from the store or from a clan lab these weapons gain experience as you use them and the higher you rank them the more mods you can apply these range from elemental mods fire rate damage etc which further enhances combat combat is fast paced and easy to pick up and plays much like other stealth games with wallruns and other cool tricks overall this game is fantastic for a free to play game with many features any gamer wants pros easy to learn hard to put down sorry for the cheesy saying matches a variety of play styles customization devs are funny poke fun at their own mistakes fast paced cons grinding grinding grinding trading proves difficult one player must have a clan no servers everything is from the host stalker is an  and only appears when you have unranked stuff equipped

has some of the best hack n slash gameplay ive even seen the guns are all kinds of badass the movement fluid the graphics up to date  and to top it all the game is completely free and no paytowin crap either now the platinum is pretty ridiculously overpriced but there is absolutely nothing in the game you cant get for free barring excalibur prime and you can t get that now anyway may involve excessive grinding though but still  m8 i r8 this game 88

fun stuff great time killer in solo and tons of fun with friends early missions are a cakewalk but it definitely has its challenging moments love how the game evolves with the player

great game if you like 3rd person bloodbaths lots of choices for each playstyle whether youre the frontline tank or the supportive one in the back weapons galore

this game is amazing im not gonna bore you with personal ideas im just gonna get right to the facts but first know this game is seriously free download it give it a whirl and if you dont like it then move on no harm done 1 the devs seriously care about this game and its community the do a devstream ever 2 weeks to discuss the future of the game what might be changing what will be changing and its all in good fun 2 its free to play and not pay to win this game is 999% pve every single weapon and warframe is able to be obtainned ingame the only things you have to pay for are cosmetic items and the helmets drop every few days and weaponframe slots but you start out with 50 plat ingame money which can go towards said weapon and frame slots dont want to pay them money no worries play the game find rare mods or prime parts which is easy unless youve angered rngesus in a past life or something prime parts are the prime parts needed to make the prime warframes and sell them to players in the community make plat that way and spend it as you please 3 the community is 98% amazing we love to help starting players find there way clear nodes and fight bosses cant figure out how to do xthing ask well do the best we can to help i need to mention that this game obviously isnt perfect there is warframes 2% of the community that arnt all hands on deck to be friendly and kind there are a ton of bugs that get fixed with nearly every hotfix usually 1 hotfix every week and rngesus wont always look upon you in favor but if you persist and take up arms and join our community welcome to warframe may the lotus be your guide

my long time favorite game there is so much content really well hidden from new players which is a bit sad but once you get there it it is worth it learning curve is quite steep and it takes a lot to understand how the game and its mechanics work to see voids orokin derelicts all the different map types atleast 7 tilesets clan dojos duels and obstacle courses codexes and lephantis propably takes atleast 50100 hours by yourself f2p model has been improved and especially frames are now a lot easier to obtain drop rates are good and there are a lot events that give you plenty of ingame credits gameplay is solid and is improved constantly and there are updates pretty much every week
recommended
i dont really write reviews that often but install this game now  your missing out on so much the game might start off slow but when you start getting prime weapons and warframes  and much much much better things  youll come to like this game more and more

love this game massive content amounts great with friends and solo any player should be welcome to the warframe forums and wiki those places help you out so much to progress in the game its completely free except cosmetics and not plagued with micro transactions everything that costs money in the game can be acquired through time and patience or selling stuff in the market game developers are also working really hard in this game packing massive updates and fixes very often kudos to the sound graphics design music controls gameplay story and support team my only issue with the game is that the many weapons in the game have one thing in common theyre bad im not talking about their mechanics or their repetitiveness im talking about the fact that you have to work hard for some interesting weapons with awesome mechanics only to figure out they are rendered useless due to insanely low damage i would love to see end game players running around with a varied arsenal not the same four master race weapons you have to have in order to take down high ranking enemies in the future of this game i would hope to see these unloved weapons such as the launchers flamethrowers crazy sidearms and shotguns buffed and at the side of tenno playing in a tower 4 survival mission or so seriously there are 217 weapons in the game none of them are just reskinned copies or similar in any way but the total amount of weapons even worth visiting only about 10 generic dps dealers other than that broken  abandoned things in the game including the log in reward system upgrade system being too complicated for new players all will be fixed as mentioned in dev streams theyve done an astounding job at paying attention to every problem we or the game has ever had

at first i was like hitler did nothing wrong then i was all like atleast michael phelps could finish a race

pretty good game ruined by bad host connection unable to connect host data migration etc fortunately its temporarily fixed by disabling direct x 10 & 11 from the launcher
recommended
from the creators of a not so known game called dark sector comes its spiritual sequel warframe a f2p game done right except many bugs and problems with amd gpus yes there are minitransactions for more space and cosmetics but its a friggin f2p game how should they earn money otherwise and you can earn this premium cash ingame if you grind prime parts in the void by selling to other players besides the important stuff like frames weapons and mats is aquired by doing missions etc you just need to explore this game is best played with friends and tend to become really boring etc if you play it alone but since its a f2p game anyone kan join which is nice right i honeslty think this is an awesome game but they could have fixed some of the very well known issues etc to make the fans a bit more happy p

great grinding game it can be a pain in the  sometimes especialy when you want to max mods

i saw a steam friend playing the game and became rather curious so i ended up adding it to my library and started playing at first it was a bit confusing some of the controls were hard to grasp once i worked through it though it became quite enjoyable i somehow believe this is what destiny was trying to achieve i havent played many hours but i have enjoyed every single hour i have played once you work through the mechanics of the game and get a handle on it it becomes a whole new environment the multiplayer aspect from what ive experienced so far has been fantastic and the community seems to be rather friendly as well if you have a good chunk of time to occupy i highly recommend looking into warframe i still am a little confused with some of the game mechanics but it doesnt change the fact that this is a great game best of all free to play 
recommended
enjoyable enough so you can spend a few hours
recommended
this is a great game i heard it was for s like you

great graphics awesome campaign missions with so many different customizations comes with your very own kubrow[sort of like an attack dog]and or a companion on missions just annoying to get resources dd

recommended
really great game a little buggy but the devs are really good about realeasing fixs warframe is constanly being added on to and fixed this game is really enjoyable its fun destorying wave after wave of enemies while getting rewards yeah warframe is super grindy but at least you can kill all your enemies with style while you grind im really excited to see what this game will be like a year from now
recommended
all you do in this game is farm i have over 800 hours of farming its ing awesome 1110 would grind again
recommended
i admit that when i first started playing this game i was impressed with all the bells and whistles that the game had to offer for a free to play game i played it so much at first that i got burnt out on it and the game just felt like a grinding fest which in essence it is but what really helps when playing this game is to make friends your friends if they have been playing for an extended period of time will beable to give you the information you need to meet your goals of a new weaponwarframe and make the process extremely simple if you like playing lone wolf that is fine as well you can set your misson access to inviteonly and if you need information check the wiki simply play how you want

great game edit 1 after playing this game off and on for the last year or so atleast 11 months tops i found i at first sucked at the game and i mean that literally since it took me 11 months just to reach rank 1 in my account  not my frames or weapons  and only a day to reach rank 2  see where im going here welp after meeting alot and i mean alot of nice and helpful people who tought me alot about the game and how things work i was able to as i said above beat the rank 1 test etc and also make my first warframe after the tutorial pick which i chose excalibur iam happy have a rhino warframe by tomorrow which will be my first warframe id ever gotten  i love the game it has a nice grind to it and also over half the things in the game you can get for free and depending the mission you go to it doesnt feel as a grind cause sometimes it starts you off at different parts of the map making it feel like your on a new map each time d d  i highly recommend you download and play this game heck if you need someone to help you out when starting out just add me on steam or add me on warframe my id is  drugfree9797  but with out the   ya as rating go these are just beta rating right now ill post them below also in under a year this game has went from what it was when i started playing to a really fun graghical world full of some nice people  also the game now has a space mode which i have yet to try since im still in the the downlow of the game i hope by the end of the year to be better in the game ratings graghics 910 intense graghics  blood and gore   710 audiovoice overs 1010 settingsoptions 1010 customization 610  its good i really should do 1010 but its limited currently right now with it in beta and all hopefully we get better customizations later on  game mechanicsphysics 1010  you can walk climb on walls and alot of others thing i dont want to spoil for you  story 210  hopefully we get an actual story mode seperate from what we have now in the game that tells an actual story not like they have it now  space mode 00  i cant right this currently cause i as of yet havent tried it controller support 510  has some issues with a gamepad but you can fix that by changing the controls etc  enemy ai  610  most fun ive ever had fighting a computer games ai  best warframe iam currently working on that but from what i can tell the best ones are valkyr rhino and nekros best tutorial warframe id have to say out of the 2 ive tried the best was volt but you may like excalibur cause he was my first choice and the only one ive successfully mastered

nice game
recommended
its a great game with an nvidia card and friends ive played since early beta and always end up coming back again and again lots of content and fresh ideas keep the repetitive gameplay from becoming stale sad to hear most review critics gave this a harsh review without getting into the high teir content   the developers listen to the community and i recommend it greatly if you dont enjoy co op games then its best to just go play cod and other generic rubbish thanks for reading add me if you like and ill help you out ps any dark sector fans will recognise a few tenno and wepons too
recommended
if you like the idea of mass effects combat as an online openended coop shooter with a massive amount of maneuverability and free movement control and customizability youll love warframe
recommended
warframe is a really fun coop game there are many weapons as well as several different warframes to fit your playstyle stealth offensive defensive support etc weapons can be easily obtained if you really put your mind to it people who say that the game is all about grinding are probably wrong yes it takes time to build weapons yes you need to obtain certain materials to craft something but in the end the game gets easier to obtain weapons and other items ive gotten most of my stuff from just crafting them theres really no need to waste money unless youre just not in the mood to craft or grind overall the game is great the mechanics are really cool gameplay is responsive and smooth graphics are great and the developers really put alot of effort into the game with many updates and events the game keeps getting better and better id recommend this game for people who like fast paced thirdperson shooters and dont mind taking their time crafting weapons warframes or making research projects for your clan
recommended
fun shooter version of diablo digital extremes is good about updates and listens to the community 810 though the game is still in beta written as of update 12

oh so addictive and it keeps getting better

the best game ive ever played

throughout my years of gaming ive stumbled across few games that provide such diversity and freedom we all crave the opportunity to play a game that has almost no limits well warframe for one is absolutely stunning it provides the player with the feeling of no limits even though it still has a few wich can almost not be noticed at all warframe is linear fun and dynamic even for a game nearing its last stages of beta its quite impressive the mechanics in the game had blown me away at some point as it has some originallity to it wich very few developers fail to master the gameplay itself however makes the player feel truely apart of the whole experience as it has a mixture of realism fun and fantasy with a twist of scifi it provides the ultimate game experience most games have failed at the combination of these elements the diversity of weapons is astonishing as it provides almost every weapon type imaginable and more another part of the game i enjoyed was the modding system i found it very easy to use and i also loved the diversity in mods available there really is almost endless possibilities especially with the elemental combination of mods wich forms new elements the customization also stood out for me it gives the player some nice personalization options to feel even more at one with the game or perhaps makes them feel more comfortable with their gameplay strangely enough the graphics of the game is quite a pleasureable aspect even though it gives some killer eye sores you know its all worth it in referral to the music i really enjoy the action movie feel it has to it and would love to see some more of it it truely gets you in the zone if there is one thing i could add to warframe itd be a bit of lore warframe is freetoplay and almost all in game content can be obtained by the player without having to pay a dime warframe is cooperative and provides a pve gamestyle with a few pvp elements wich are seemingly still in development and i am quite eager to see the outcome of the pvp system warframe also provides players the option to trade for platinum wich is basically only obtained from buying it with real time currency in short warframe is not a paytowin but if you feel like supporting the developers for thier great work then buying some platinum is a good way to support them but to sum it all up i strongly reccomend warframe if you are looking for something new and different and encourage some rpg fans to try it out aswell as those diehard mmo fans keep up the good work i am excited to see what comes next with the further developement of this game if i had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 id give it a 7610

its fun to play so many possibilities to play the game lots of epic weapons and warframes no pay 2 win ninjas in space need i say more

what to say about this gameive played this for a long timea really long time way back in the beginning of its alpha and its really grown since thenthere are consistant updates that keep everything fresh and new and fastpaced third person shooting brawling that most people would be interested inbut as much as i love this game thats sort of where the bright sides end the game in its nutshellis a huge farmfest thats it you earn mastery rank basically an account level through levelling gear which unlocks missions weapons and gear for you until about rank 7 which as is expected of the community they will look at this and think how they could possible perfect this system and they haveyou farm the same mission over and over again usually either defense you have an objective to defend from oncoming waves or survival you defend yourself from oncoming waves while keeping your oxygen supply up from drops from the enemies and capsules which drop by the time youre aboutsay mastery rank 4 you will be doing the same old thing in the same place the same way and if youre not brainlessly farming xp for a warframe or weapon your farming materials to make another weaponwarframe to farm xp for them on the other hand the farming methods means you get diverse weaponry that you are forced to use instead of clinging to a single weapon like a lifeline and never leaving ituntil you realise just how bad 80% of the weapons arecome on this game has rocket hammers glaives chainsaw whips lightning throwers beamrifles quad barrelled shotguns and yetalmost non of these weapons can by used by the end with the end game rifle being the soma prime next up is warframes and what a selection you get warframes are the classes of the games and there are over 20 to choose from and their abilities differ from creating clones going beserk summoning water tentacles from the floor balls that turn into black holes etc etc but again too bad 70% of them are dwarfed in terms of useability with most highend groups refusing anyone who isnt on the good warframe list and just to prove my point should you get this gamejust count how many times you see a hydroid warframe800 hours and ive legitimately seen 3 hydroids in a game with 22 different warframes at this current time why are only 6 or 7 are viable the paying system is what youd expect from any f2p app the simple pay to make things more convinient take on it with weapons taking 12 hours to craft and warframes taking atleast 35 days to make they are nice to begin with they give you some starting platinum only about enough to pay for the cheapest warframe there is or to increase your warframeweapon slots a couple times i cant complain with it if you have the patience then you wont have to pay a penny its difficult to say how i feel about the developersyes its good that they are coming up with updates on a regular basis that theyre trying to keep things fresh but they have a horrible habit of releasing a new weapon making it overpowered so everyone will buy it and items to upgrade it then nerf it in a weeks time when everyone has got one claiming they were fixing it this wouldnt be a problem if this didnt happen consistantly over the time i played it in conclusion despite these things the gameis oddly fun even with its mindnumbing goals and sneaky tactics to part you with your money and being free to play it wouldnt hurt to try it out and there is some joy in being an overlypowerful space ninja destroying waves of space clonesmerchants or zombies ps this is simply my opinion on the game some of my knowledge on the game is slightly outdated but otherwise this should be fairly accurate
recommended
i know you guys are missing from the first time you have heard of this game immerse yourself in a day and it turned into was that i surprise is a popular game community simple operation simple to play but it really is difficult to be difficult to know if the game is waiting for hard times and lack of game sense
recommended
i played this game for 534 hrs on record was fun while it lasted pick it up if you got nothing to do

very very interesting game

basically you are a futuristic ninja in space why would you not play this game

warframe warframe ive spent alot of hours playing this game and i can safely say that its extremely funny like many other games warframe is far from perfect but its unique coop style combat and generally its concept makes it stand out while i could go on a talk about every aspect of the game ill try to keep it short pros enjoyable farm for me atleast i have never farmed in a single game to give you an idea i used to sell my extra epics in vanilla wow just to take flight paths i think this could illustrate that i really didnt farm i can vouch that warframe farming has another element to it maybe because the combat its fun great combat warframe is a great 3rd person action shooter you can also inflict pain by using melee weapons multiple weapons there are literally about 200 different weapons in the game at the moment all of them which you can purchase from the store with in game cash aka credits which are easily acquired or for other weapons farm the components different types of missions which all have specific goals if you dont like a mission type and dont really need anything from it its pretty straightforward do not do it pvp while unbalanced its still really funny and by no means mandatory it can be seen as another type of mission great coop game if not the best ive played i wont compare it with games such as broforce or castlecrashers cons  and i really hate saying that  zero endgame if you ever get to farm all of the frames and weapons you want max them etc well theres really no one to use them on the tower 4 missions are considered to be the lategame even there you have to wait 40mins or 40waves in order to get somewhat of a challenge and if the whole group is skilled you will have to wait even more bugs game is not filled with but has some bugs which grow tiresome after a while most common would be having an enemy that goes underground and you having no chance of killing him if you dont have some sort of rocket launcher or spell that will hit anything close unbalanced like pretty much every other game warframe sense of balance is broken out of the 200 weapons i mentionned above well they are pretty much all useless except of course the small list of guns that are completely op compared to their brethren about 15 maybe 20 guns masteryrank while i really liked that system it proved to be nothing else but numbers rising after reaching mr 8 you can have every weapon i think aside from that well its not really rewarding to level up you have to constantly craft new weapons and level them up being myself rank 11 i surely like seeing the number but i feel like theres no much more to it future orientation of course i do not know where the game is headed but i started playing somewhere in july the developpers where already saying that endgame would be included ive seen some cool reworks being done new aspects of the game being created new missions that are about space combat however end game has still not been included storywise while warframe does seem to have a story line we know very little about it which is a shame as i even downloaded a really crappy game to get an idea of wf story the game was dark sector friendly advice  do not download dark sector chat system & ui i dont even know where to begin with noob unfriendly fortunately for me i started out the game with alot of friends and we already had friends which were high leveled and everything was explained if i were to startout this game alone i probably would have seen only the first planet conclusion even though the cons are important the game is still awesome and kicks  i really hope the developers realize that they have a great game and that they could easily make it one of the best games with the addition of minimal stuff really i really recommend this game 810 yeah

a great game ive been playing since founders beta and i myself am a founder however i havent been playing this as much as i used to mostly because as time goes by i feel like this game isnt catered for me at all dont get me wrong its still fun and i still recommend it its mostly a personal thing i like games where i feel like its my character that im sticking into the game i want to feel like i can build and play it the way i want in a game like warframe though youre given the characters classes with very little customization options and while there may be some argument in reality theres only a few viable builds unless youre content with staying with the really low level missions if you can get past that this game has fun fast action and a lot of different kinds of missions and different maps randomly generated to some extent a decent community and a lot of fun stuff to buy if youre the type that likes to spend real money on games like me

this is most likely one of the best 20142015 games there arelots of content and constantly adding more while fixing the small bugs or things theydont like along the way big thumbs up to the community best ive seen in yearspolar opposite of the cs go onepeople are generaly really nice and helpfull give it a try see you on the battlefield

ill be honest i havent really played much of this game but from what i have played so far it is really fun a lot of people are talking about the grind here which i havent gotten on to yet but im sure it is there so far paying to get certain items doesnt seem like a necessity and can be avoided its really fun and probably one of the best f2p games on steam right now great for coop
recommended
when you first pick up the game be ready to spend a little money or youll spending many days just trying to be a high enough level for people not to avoid you its an awesome game if you dont care about story line or game breaking bugs that take about a week to fix the game receives huge updates every other month or so so you never get to bored and always have something else to rank up but you remember those bugs i was just warning about at least 3 of those come out each time a new update pops up so over half the time youre playing this game youll be experiencing very annoying glitches for example you might be running a survival missionyou have a time limit and the more enemies you kill the longer you last and no enemies will spawn causing you to lose the game and that lose will always be on your record for anyone to see other then that its a great game with awesome graphics not a terrible player basepeople wont start yelling hey  you and rewarding gameplay that will without a doubt make you feel like an alian neo ninja just itching to climb a wall and kill a bad guy  death from above style

if you dont want to get addicted to a game dont install this game ^^

now that over a thousand hours of my life have gone into this game as well as a good chunk of cash i can really give this a better review in short its fun but doesnt feel like its going in the direction it shouldor that i would like i dont really know how to describe my feelings for it after ui 20 it just wasnt as much fun i was rank 16highest you could be at the time and had every weapon i could obtain except for 3 and then new ones came and then more and more sure this is how warframe has been but for some reason it just wasnt as fun some of the new weapons now look fun but during that time i couldnt get back into it i will say that if you come across this review and havent played yet get the game its amazing when you fist start out as you have so many weapons and warframes to choose from and of course its a grindfest so if youre into that then you will be fine i hope you enjoy this game and maybe youll see it finally get releasedcorpusgrineer

the first free to play game that you dont need to pay to be over power

very good game friendly player community constantly updated with new things and hotfixes good controls and awesome graphics for its size and requeriments and the best part is that you are not forced to buy cash to get cash items as you can easily farm them as you play minimum 5 minutes of farm depending on luck and sell them for ingame cash aside from cosmetics there are nothing that you cant get without a little bit of 30 min effort and not a single cent of money involved

really a teamwork effort many open possibilities with weapon especially the mods challenging with a satisfying result at the end for connection maybe it could be better to do a stabilizing connection so that everyone can play it without leaving a friends behind who wanting to play it too
recommended
somewhat addictive high quality for a f2p game action shooter with a high focus on mobility i highly recommend every living gamer to at least try this game once
recommended
this is a really fun pve game can be a bit of a grindfest at times but it everything can be gotten from drops it does have a pay element but that is mostly used for speeding crafting up and getting items you can grind for has a fun pvp capture the flag style game that is very balanced
recommended
this is an amazing game the only problem i can see is the fact that the missions get really repetitive otherwise i would recommend this game to any avid gamers out there looking for a free nonpaytowin game

its a game

this is a real action spacebased game very recomended please read on if youre considering trying this game out its got some tips on how the game works the game itself is slightly complicated when it comes to upgrading weapons and your warframe but after a while of playing it is easy to understand despite the market frames and weapons costing platinummoney bought with real money you can get every single one of the weapons or frames by killing bossesyou do not have to do it alone or from clan researchesa clan which has the weaponwarframe you are seeking researched you buy blueprintsyou can buy them for gamemoney credits and if you farm enough compotents you start the build the building time ranges from 12hrs  24hrs depending on the weapon warframe partshelmet chassis and systems build for 12hrs and the building of a whole frame is 3 days in short everything is free yes youve heard me right every awesome weapon or warframe can be gotten for 100% free if you have the patience for it even platinum can be earned for free by selling prime weapon parts and warframe parts in the trading chat you make a deal trade in the clan dojo using the trading post this game gives you a lot of opportunities if you dont have spare money for platinum the only thing you cannot get for free are the suguratathings that dangle from melee weapons a bit of a decoration and warframe syandanascloaksscarves and warframe armorarmor for warframe customization despite this the game is worth trying out you will simply love the world the freedom in this shooter as you can fight with swords warhammers bladed frisbeesglaives sparring weapons dual daggers dual swords you got bows snipers lots of guns flame throwers laserguns crossbows nikanakatana or onehand crossbows throwing knives shurikens dual pistols onehand pistols gas pistols microwave pistols so many weapons an opportunities and then youve got modssomething that increases damage or adds an elemental damage to your weapon also increases shield and health capacity in warframes so that you can mod your weapons and warframe to adapt to your gaming type each mod can be fusioned making the effect stronger consuming fusion cores which you collect throughout the mission this just adds more great options yet the more ranked the mod the more mod capacity points it consumes in frames and weapons mod capacity increases as you level at maximum weaponframe rank you got 30 mod points you can double those by purchasing an orokin reactororokin catalyst for a mere of 20platinum but you can get free blueprints from alert missions which randomly appear at random times throughout the day you can also use formascan be bought or built more common to find forma blueprints rather than orokin reactorcatalystto change the polarities in the mod slots if the chosen polarity matches the polarity of the mod half the points are consumed pretty complicated right as you play along it will be natural for you to remember all this ask an experienced player for help if you need itjust ask in region chat thank you for taking time to read this now go ahead and try this game out

intro so ive been around since the closed beta of this gameand one thing is for sure you will hardly find any other online game that evolves as rapidly as this one and grows in size so continuouslyyou can see that the devs truly love the game and not just the money it generates the classic space ninjas theme has over the years evolved to more of a mercenary theme with many influences the game there is no good or bad there is just balance set thousands of years in the future you have just been woken up from your cryogenic sleep you are a tenno controlling one of the many warframes available to you and you basically answer to the lotus which is an organization and a person at the same time your ultimate goal would be to bring balance to the solar system againbecause fact is bringing peace is not an option rather than being a white knight in shining armor you will have to set priorities on who to fight and who to helpand your priorities can and will realign at timeseither because you want itor because the majority of tenno are willing it your tools are abilities companions guns and melee weaponry sometimes you have to kill sometimes to infiltrate or rescuebut what you do is entirely your choice long term now nothing is wrong with hopping onto a survival match for 20 minutes or just doing a few boss runs and logging off againbut you probably wonder can i invest more than a few hours what can i do in the long term and the game devs got you covered there the first and most obvious goal would probably be to try and buildaquire all weapons and characters you like and perfect themof course this is not for everyone as some pieces of gear especially for new players can feel grindy to aquire once you are a veteran this will be of no concern to you as resources come to you naturally then there are things like syndicates that you can join and run missions for to gain standing some factions even give you goals that are shared with all other tenno that upon completion grant you access to new bits of lore of the world or other rewards pvp also existsand is entirely optional but capture the cephalon flag or deathmatch tdm all exist and finally there are events and questschallenges the devs will regularly add story driven events where the entirety of the community can partakeand sometimes due to the mercenary nature of the tennowill have to split to follow the path that they think is right but do not be fooled events can actually fail not every mission is about gloryand the higher the payroll the more ruthless the enemy the cash shop the item mall is very fairas in the initial prices will look very scary until you realize that you dont have to pay for any of it and can still get it at a very acceptable pace the only thing that cant be aquired with ingame currency are some style itemsfor which you can still trade some items for premium currency to unlock it anyway additionally there is a chance to get discounts for premium currency as login bonus up to 75% and the steam packs are on sale on pretty much every big steam sale event with 50%66% discountat which point everything in the mall becomes absurdly cheap so basicallyif you are an impulse buyer that can not restrain himself at all this game might not be entirely for you but if you are a freeloader looking for a fair game or someone who either wants to do trades or only spend on games for a budget with discountsyou will do just fine here lastly developers have even pulled cash shop items from the market within very short time periods whenever something was added that the community disagreed with stronglywhich was never pay to winbut generally about taking it a little too far with style items pay to win does not exist in their cash shop pretty much only pay to sleepwhich is something you will understand once you start playing sort of a running gag the developers i can not stress this enough the developers love their game it is more than just a product to them they have livestreams every week and will directly communicate changes and content updates with the playerbaseand necessarily change it if the players dislike it this goes as far as affecting the cash shopsee above they constantly seek to improve their game and they have redone entire game systems and polished the graphics multiple times dx12 support is also announced and currently pbr physically based rendering is being implemented step by step they even did things like changing the core multiple times in hopes to imrove it 8 out of 10 times they succeedand when they failthey simply try again its that simple for them as for content they have concrete plans what they add and every 2 weeks they showcase what they are working on to players in their devstreams depending on feedback this will of course changebut thats why they do it the only thing that you cannot expectis anything to last forever in that game even core gameplay elements can still change the devs simply try to improve the game as much as they can and follow their visionwhich sometimes clashes with players opinions personal opinion i loved the game so far it is true that i went on hiatus 3 or 4 times for a month or so with this game but keep in mind that the game and all of its content except for some style items are essentially freeso you can just pick it up again whenever new content is added or they changed some game systems of course this game is not for everyone but if you want fluent combat this is yours

this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

nine out of tenno

this game has everything ninjas  yep weapons  yep space  yep multiplayer  yep bosses  yep everyone who likes to play as a space ninja will like this game i guess
recommended
this game is robot space ninjas with guns and magic i cant describe it any better than this free to play no pressure to buy anything only thing im not liking much is the realtime delays on being able to rank up and make new weaponry and such
recommended
what really gets me to play this game is the controls everything really is based on how you can move yourself after that customization of you warframe and weapons using mods from then on it was a perfect mix it has taken a lot of time away from me but i do not regret it one bit
recommended
you want to be a space ninja well this is the game for you the game supports many different playstyles through a large variety of weapons and warframes each warframe has their own unique abilities which can drastically change the course of the battle some are designed to be support roles whilst others work to strengthen themselves which also increases threat generation either way it is possible to play on your own but i have had the most fun out of the game by playing with other people and talking over a ts3 server whilst we play only cons that i can think of are that it can be a bit of a grind unless you make a few overpriced microtransactions but hey it is a free to play game where you can go through it without paying a single microtransaction additionally the end game gear is not available via microtransation so even if you pump money into the game you still have something to work towards

epic 9910  pros 1 this game is what i wanted destiny to be 2 it feels like a mass effect multiplayer dungeon grinder 3 you can get rep with factions and level over 32 characters 200 weapons and many mods 4 the mods feel almost like mtg mixed with the ff7 materia system and i love everything about the tradingfusingmoving mods between all your weapons 5 you can actually play the game for free but you are not going to 6 you will spend money on more frame slots and weapon slots but after putting hundreds of hours in it is completely justified you really get a great experience with this game 8 doesnt feel like pay to win at all 9 dungeons are mixed up so its not alway the same run if you go somewhere again for material 10 ton of differient mission variants 11 very addicting 12 making weapons with blueprints and fusing modsadding polarity to mod slots makes the game feel like more than just a shooter you can murder things when you want to you can chill in your clan dojoship when you want to relax and paint your armorweaponscustomize dps outputs 13 you can get companions  cons 1if you want more than 4 characters you will have to spend money at some point but not much 2 bosses should be harder 3 you should be able to kick someone from a group if they go afk or something by voting 4 its very addicting like first time i played wow addicting but better just play the game you will have to adjust graphics and hotkey x to your mouse the game just gets better and better i enjoy running missions solo with friends or even with randoms you have your own loot and nothing really to lose so i just leave my party open and solo levels if others show up it just means i will get through the level faster

fun game all in all but would really help if they wouldnt change everything every 2 months

970 hours on record and counting because this is easily one of my favorite multiplayer games on steam and i got over 300 games the action is excellent the customisability is unbeatable the control of your character troughout your environment is the smoothest you can imagine this is truely an absolutely brilliant multiplayer action shooter experience what kind of weapon do you like go on make a weapon work exactly the way you want it to be using hundreds if not thousands of mods that completely change the way any of the huge amounts of available weapons work what kind of gameplay do you want your character to provide theres various kinds to suit all tastes with all kinds of different gameplay from slow tanks with defensive powers to overpowered glass cannon mages or stealthy ones if you prefer being silent and sneaky or my favorite warframe zephyr which boasts incredible mobility and low gravity not to even mention the powers getting ingame money platinum in this game is a shortcut and theres nothing you cant normally get without platinum but having at least a little bit would be good for getting orikin catalysts which are normally a little hard to get to make your weapons more moddable thats about it if you like smooth shooters action and customisability this is definitely a game for you besides its free to try this review may sound very positive but thats because i honestly have nothing bad to say about this game at all other than how hard it has been for me to find friends to play it with but i guess thats individual seriously its free why havent you tried it yet oh and theres an introduction questline nowdays they didnt used to have that a while ago oh and i havent even mentioned the breathtakingly epic space fights they added recently

this game is really fun between firefights and kickass sword fights its pretty neat

good f2p it is very grindy but you can get things you want without paying it is repetitive
recommended
yes  good game yes 
recommended
sorry for grammar btw honestly for the longest time i have had mixed feelings towards the game and sometimes question why i even play the game at all at time to start the games story is nonexistent but who cares youre a space ninja killing mobs on mobs on mobs the core component is the games combat system which is solid but also choppy at times with glitches in animations and such there are a variety of weapons ranging from a gas spraying pistol to a bone scythe which are for the most part fun to use however this is also the downfall as many weapons such as the soma that you get mid game is extremely powerful in both stat and you literally have no reason not to use it as it trumps every other assault rifle in the game currently the weapons are extremely unbalanced to the point of players using five or so weapons out of the 100 weapons the next major component of the game is frames or your character basically there is also an issue with this that is very similar to the unbalanced weapon problem some frames are simply better than others with better abilities and all not much to say about it next would have to be the enemies my god have they progressedbut in a bad way it seems the developers just got plain lazy and decided to cheese all of the enemies by buffing the hell out of them instead of improving their ai movements or things such as i dont know variety maybe you fight the same guy with a gun same alien that blows up same person with a rocket launcher fighting them will get really dull really fast for allot of people there are many other components that need discussing but for now ill end it with the good points  warframe is really addicting and will pull you back for more even if the mission seem like a pile of bs or an event that gives you a trashy weapon you always come back i cant for the life of me figure out why i suppose its like league of legends you always come back somehow the business model is also amazing platinum or paid currency in this game work allot better than about 90% of other games the prices are fair and they often give you coupons for things like 50% off your next platinum purchase the best part thought is that you dont even need to buy any in the first place everything in this game you can get buy one method or another given you have the patience and prowess to do so you can also buy parts from other players with either trades or platinum depending on what they want in conclusion the game is by no means bad but definitely not amazing either it has a ton of bugs that need fixing and the combat needs to be revised weapons and frames need buffschangesreworks in order to be viable also please if im asking to buy a max mod dont sell me a half completed mod like common man
recommended
this games awesome and kinda challenging really fun multiplayer gameplay
recommended
when you first pick up the game be ready to spend a little money or youll spending many days just trying to be a high enough level for people not to avoid you its an awesome game if you dont care about story line or game breaking bugs that take about a week to fix the game receives huge updates every other month or so so you never get to bored and always have something else to rank up but you remember those bugs i was just warning about at least 3 of those come out each time a new update pops up so over half the time youre playing this game youll be experiencing very annoying glitches for example you might be running a survival missionyou have a time limit and the more enemies you kill the longer you last and no enemies will spawn causing you to lose the game and that lose will always be on your record for anyone to see other then that its a great game with awesome graphics not a terrible player basepeople wont start yelling hey  you and rewarding gameplay that will without a doubt make you feel like an alian neo ninja just itching to climb a wall and kill a bad guy  death from above style

the reason i play this game is because awesome bow weapon d

ill be honest i havent really played much of this game but from what i have played so far it is really fun a lot of people are talking about the grind here which i havent gotten on to yet but im sure it is there so far paying to get certain items doesnt seem like a necessity and can be avoided its really fun and probably one of the best f2p games on steam right now great for coop
recommended
fun yet free best free to play so far in my opinion
recommended
love the gameplay and general leveling of weapons and gear you can use special items to really customize your gear and make it that much more powerful it is definitely a game geared toward using the right tool for the job not a bigger hammer cons crashes a lot

if you like cooperative games this is a really good one third person shooter coupled with good progression system and lots of randomgenerated missions this is a fun game to play together only downside is that its still in beta so it has bugs but the game is getting better with patches 
recommended
free to play games where you actually dont have to pay are always awesome this one is up there much better if you play it with friends rather than all alone make sure to read up on some newbie guides once youre ready as this will give you a much more enjoyable experience if youre not planning to buy any ingame currency
recommended
a fun fast and slow paced third person shooter you can choose to play through missions with stealth tactics or just go allout and shoot the crap out of your enemies

this game is great to play with friends and have some fun if you are loner then you probably get bored after some time even after they have made a lot of improvements since i first played back in the beta this game lacks of endgame content sometimes you will find yourself a little pressured to actually put some money on this game yes you can get most thing by grinding and being lucky on alert mission but golden potatoes to overcharge your warframe are really rare

i admit that when i first started playing this game i was impressed with all the bells and whistles that the game had to offer for a free to play game i played it so much at first that i got burnt out on it and the game just felt like a grinding fest which in essence it is but what really helps when playing this game is to make friends your friends if they have been playing for an extended period of time will beable to give you the information you need to meet your goals of a new weaponwarframe and make the process extremely simple if you like playing lone wolf that is fine as well you can set your misson access to inviteonly and if you need information check the wiki simply play how you want

great game edit 1 after playing this game off and on for the last year or so atleast 11 months tops i found i at first sucked at the game and i mean that literally since it took me 11 months just to reach rank 1 in my account  not my frames or weapons  and only a day to reach rank 2  see where im going here welp after meeting alot and i mean alot of nice and helpful people who tought me alot about the game and how things work i was able to as i said above beat the rank 1 test etc and also make my first warframe after the tutorial pick which i chose excalibur iam happy have a rhino warframe by tomorrow which will be my first warframe id ever gotten  i love the game it has a nice grind to it and also over half the things in the game you can get for free and depending the mission you go to it doesnt feel as a grind cause sometimes it starts you off at different parts of the map making it feel like your on a new map each time d d  i highly recommend you download and play this game heck if you need someone to help you out when starting out just add me on steam or add me on warframe my id is  drugfree9797  but with out the   ya as rating go these are just beta rating right now ill post them below also in under a year this game has went from what it was when i started playing to a really fun graghical world full of some nice people  also the game now has a space mode which i have yet to try since im still in the the downlow of the game i hope by the end of the year to be better in the game ratings graghics 910 intense graghics  blood and gore   710 audiovoice overs 1010 settingsoptions 1010 customization 610  its good i really should do 1010 but its limited currently right now with it in beta and all hopefully we get better customizations later on  game mechanicsphysics 1010  you can walk climb on walls and alot of others thing i dont want to spoil for you  story 210  hopefully we get an actual story mode seperate from what we have now in the game that tells an actual story not like they have it now  space mode 00  i cant right this currently cause i as of yet havent tried it controller support 510  has some issues with a gamepad but you can fix that by changing the controls etc  enemy ai  610  most fun ive ever had fighting a computer games ai  best warframe iam currently working on that but from what i can tell the best ones are valkyr rhino and nekros best tutorial warframe id have to say out of the 2 ive tried the best was volt but you may like excalibur cause he was my first choice and the only one ive successfully mastered

500 hour mark with this in mind i believe i can make a accurate review this game as of now 1242014 is still a beta in process to be a story filled mmo the basis is you use a character called a warframe to runs strikes on the solar system against arguably 10 factions 3 races and 3 different sets of bounty hunters you are reffered to as tenno the people of the lotus the tenno fight foragainst others to bring balance to the system you are awakened by the lotus to prevent from being captured by the grineer to be used and processed to be their weeaponslaveresource to gain universal domination as it were for the purpose of keeping from spoiling the game ill get into this this is a mmo this is not an easy mmo if you have deep pockets and believe in buying all great gear youll be highly dissapointed because theres this thing called xp locked that keep people like you from ruining this game and speed running it to be better than everyone else in fact the entire game is genuinly 100% free minus cosmetic items like color and skins etc everything in the game minus the cosmetic items can be obtained through simply playing ingame missions give credits which are used to build bluprints to beef your arsenal up there is a achievement labeled for having 10 warframes each tool with its own purpose this is true for the game slash damage shreds fleshy enemies to pieces but sheilded ones left unphased impact bomards shields but armor shrugs it off puncture you guessed it pierces armor but does a whole lot of nothing to shields sheilds save lives all tactics should be analyzed rank up is broken down as follows xp from primarysecondarymeleewarframespooled xpmastery rank the max rank for everything is level 30 including mastery rank if you level an item to 30 you will only recieve xp that counts that first time if you use forma to level it to zero to make it stronger later the other times after the first its leveled to 30 will not count toward your mastery rank every time you hit the xp cap for a mastery rank there is a right of passage type of test to rank if you fail you will be able to try again in 24 hours if you pass then you proceed to the next rank unlocking weapons and other new items there are plenty of weapons i promise you will not run out crafting this is easier than it sounds go do a mission and collect the drops the resources currently are gallium nano spores mutagen samples mutagen mass orokin cells polymer bundle alloy plate rubedo salvage detonite ample detonite injectors fieldtron samples fieldtron oxium nav coordinates nurodes neural sensors last two are not related to each other argon crystal control modules golem nav coordnate morphics cuircuts and plastids none of these are too difficult to find all are used from time to time for different items the more you have on hand the less as much as i hate saying it farming you have to do gamplay you are a space ninja thre is no better way to describe it you do flips wallruns slides and parcour of all kinds be it rolling from a fall or vaulting to a higher spot this is your deadliest weapon each warframe has unique abilities that they use they are described in the market or abilities option in your arsenal 90% of the game is pve clan battles that you arearent apart of you may assist for funcredit earnings conclave is also available as a deathmatch for a morepersonal 1v1 or 2v2 fight as a beta this game is a 1010 nyxsilence

i figured i would rewrite my review of this game completely so allow me to start off with a bit of back story warframe is the hypothetical predocessor of des dark sector in dark sector the main character being hayden tenno is where the warframes in the game get their faction name of tenno hypothetically speaking in this universe the reason why the tenno are they way they are is for the same reason why hayden is the way he is we are human beings that had been infected by the technocyte in a positive way opposite to that of the infested where parts of the body if not all of the body have been turned to metal than gifted by the lotus one of the main protagonists in the game a suit of armor known as a warframe to fit the contores of our infection pros this game is free to play 1 not pay to win there is a real money currency known as platinum that can be used to purchase in game items down to weapons warframes and cosmetics such as accessories and colour pallets however because this game is not entirely pvp oriented as much as it is pve you need not worry about getting bulldozed by every wallet warrior out there and their cousin ______________________________________________________________________________ 2 on pvp to pve there are particular nodes specifically made just for pvp and they are few and far between each planet has 1 pvp node known as a dark sector these dark sectors are where different clans have at it with each other in order to control parts of the universe if one particular clan owns a dark sector they have the ability to determine the tax on the planet for all resources and credits earned by the players while participating on the objective of said dark sector _______________________________________________________________________________ 3 clans pretty much everyone can own one and it does not cost real money currency as a matter of fact for the lack of time it takes to create your dojo the way you want it and the time spent waiting for it to be comepleted its 100% free _______________________________________________________________________________ 4 dojos one of the best perks to owning a clan is building your own dojo now like i said in the above technically speaking it is free for the lack of time and materials you will have to farm for to do this however once you own your clan and start to build your own dojo you have the freedom to make it as big as you want with no extra cost in real money currency all it takes is the time youre willing to put into it _______________________________________________________________________________ the above were my favorite points to the game in which i have added explanations the rest ill just leave as points _______________________________________________________________________________ 5 there is a multitude of weapons warframes accessories to choose from _______________________________________________________________________________ 6 different planets with missions set at different levels enemies do not level with you _______________________________________________________________________________ 7 constant updates and hotfixes to the game de has done well to keep the players in the loop as well keep good customer service _______________________________________________________________________________ 8 freedom of movement this game has one of the best parkour systems ive found yet in a video game behind assassins creed that is _______________________________________________________________________________ 9 very smooth 3rd person shooting action with the mixture of smart movement you have the ability to lunge forward and shoot slide and shoot wall run and shoot slide and slice jump and slice or slam and wall run and slice _______________________________________________________________________________ 10 the community is an alright one obviously each have their fair share of trolls within the game on warframes region chat however most questions are answered and if not in game always on the forums in a timely manner as well with an active wiki _______________________________________________________________________________ 11  _______________________________________________________________________________ cons i am not awake enough to continue thinking on this review so in time i will come back with more information

well just to start anything you see in the trailers is possible  seriously all the warframes are crafted easily from blueprints and parts most of the game revolves around maxing out lvl 30 weapons to mod them adding a range of statuses like toxin ice fire or blast to the wep although it may seem confusing a few visits to youtube and following the tutorial basically shows you the lot the game isnt exactly perfect and is still being worked on in terms of getting stuck in the map  type unstuck to get out of a glitch  but seems to be just fine the game just added spaaaaaaace to the works so now you can fly around like a madman whenever you have the requirements this needs to be crafted d  if youre looking for a gory fancy graphic game then this is second to none one of the besties best ones around

welp the time has come for a review pros smooth gameplay awesome characters customizable tons of weapons new maps and characters added now and thenwhich is cool beautiful graphics cons you need to wait a little to build a new warframe or a new weapon but its ok its worth waiting andthats all from my personal experience _ died from shockwave moa bug got shot down from grineer ballista burned to crisp from grineer napalm ten out of ten would again die from all of these things so i can revive and kick their  back good jobi recomment this game to anyone who likes 3rd person shooter with a lot of guns customizasion and gameplay

devs are active they give out free plat because a lot of the community loves them and they love the community back they try to err on the side of making things harder to get rather than easier mostly a good community some that are too serious and get  off if you dont singlehandedly carry the team its a grindfest its also fun the ui is smooth steep level curve because your weapons are upgraded with mods that have to be found and then leveled up from rank 0 eg serration increases primary weapon damage rank 0 to rank 1 requires 1 unranked rank 0 copy rank 2 requires 2 3 requires 4 etc for 1024 to get to rank 10 some powerfulcommonly needed mods are rank 10 lots are lower some weapons are objectively better not all weapons are generically bad lots of weapons have different feels to them lots of different warframes if you are a completionist you will eventually take issue with the random number generator used to determine if you get a certain part of a certain weaponwarframe you want theres a lot to do in the game update 17 coming soon and it will change how missionscontent are available its fun eleven out of tenno and to clarify there is no paywall you can buy aesthetics with money you can buy inventory space for warframes and weapons and you can buy stuff that allows you to mod your stuff even better however the stuff that lets you mod your stuff better orokin catalystsreactors [potatoes] forma can be found rarely as an alert mission or login reward and there is increasing numbers of alternate cosmetics that can not be bought with money but with ingame currency moreover the paid currency platinum is available to trade for ingame what platinum you can trade for is limited only by who wants to buy what and what you have to sell there isnt a vicious cycle that prevents you from doing this unless youre hoarding all your stuff and refuse to sell anything in the first place

i have searched for a good combat mmo game aside from the popular console call of dutyhalo ect for a long time and i have finaly found one stratagy combat skills construction critical thinking lore all in one game the devs are always coming up with ways to add to the game or expand the games lore universegameplay so the game is always evolving the user base is for the most part supportive and friendly and unlike most games i have tried the elitist jerk few cant set up roadblocks to the common player base and make thier gameplay miserable and unfruitful a word of warning becasue the game is always evolving it is natural that bugs come with that territory players affectionatly call it bugframe or crashframe becasue of it but in my opinion the rewarding gameplay is worth it a word on its free 2 play status as there is much critizism especailly after 150 update although there are some limitations at trying to running it f2p it can be done game currency can be earned thru the player trading system game currency only items can be earned in the game although takes more timein less quantity and certain items can be traded for things you want but cant get if you do decide to put some money in the game a little goes a long way and there is discount coupons all the time

ive been pretty impressed with the quality of this game the replayability is pretty high as well because of how many warframes there are and how customizable your various loadouts can be given the many weapons mods and other options its also continuously updated and they actually fix bugs soon after i discover them which is really quite rare for a free to play

free to play in the right dirrection so many games that are free to play are like swimming with a lead life vest to get it off you have to pay for the key to properly stay afloat warframe has nothing like that they just put the islands far away as hell and you can choose at what pace you get to them with alot of f2p games 90% of the content is locked behind a wall of money but here its the opposite a vast majority of what you see is free frames characters are all attainable by grinding the pieces and resources needed to build them as goes with the weapons too by default you get one of the base frames and base weapons of your choice with the availability to get 1 aditional frame and eight weapons without paying a single dime with the starting free money they give you its possible to unlock additional frames and weapons spots to have more off the bat the only thing you cannot get free are color chemes some animations and so on but those are all asthetics its possible to play the game end to end without spending any money story is a general mmo stereotype you have control of a powerful character grindy missions save the universe ect not much more to it than that there are very few games i get headlong into the lore of and this is not one of them there may be more than what i said but i dont feel compelled to learn the in and out of every faction there are several starting story missions to get you the required gear to play any game type and an npc companion for free the combat is great controls are tight and responsive popping a headshot is easy the runslide and hump feels natural after a few minutes of gameplay the parkourwall running is a bit buggy but there is no penalty for falling out of bounds as it just pops you back into the level combat difficulty is a bit high later on into the games making it necessary to team up with others to help ease the load but you can jump into a game and play with random players if there are any for the selected mission weapon selection is a bit low as i love having hundreds of guns to play with but they have a decent selection of pistols rifles bows and ultimate prime weapons and power cards to make them all better as you level them up standard affair for weapons rifles snipers bows shotguns smgs and pistols graphics are great im running an nvidia 750 it runs on high settings but not ultra even so its a gorgeous game that looks beautiful through each planetlevel the levels are based off of tile sets and wind up being different missions constructed with the same pieces but a different lay out on each planetship you go through while level designs are endless you start to see alot of similarities over time even with the different variations of each right off the bat this isnt a game i play alot and usually with friends only i am hesitant about spending any money on it as this is more of a social game for me play with friends and have fun if this is your scene and you love the game to death theres nothing wrong with dropping full game price 60$ for the extra stuff as its a very well polished complete title that is worth that much at least as they add more things to do frames to play as you can go ahead and spend more on it i wont blame you however be warned there is several hundred dollars of content to buy if you dont want to grind out the supplies and frame blueprints warframe is bet played with patience and friends everything can be built immediately for platinum the real money currency or bought with it via the market or player trading it can take up alot of hours to get the characters and weapons if you dont want to spend any money off the bat everything aside from the color shcemes can be recieved in game with a bit of time and some higher level friends even if you dont know anyone that plays warframe there is a chat channel that you can ask to join in on higher level missions to level and get better items and resources from the start breakdown graphics 910 story 310 gameplay 910 reliability 810 fun 810 value 1110 quick breakdown be patient gets some friends this is a grindy game if you dont want to spend cash amazing graphics tight gameplay and 90% of the game content only costs time to get

el juego es bueno si dejaran de desinstalar los juegos gratis sera mucho mejor no es muy graciosos tener que descargando juegos sobre todo con un gran contenido the game is good if they stopped uninstall the free games would be much better is not very funny having to downloading games especially with a large content

warframe when i first started back on its inital release i was never able to get very far i forgot my account details more than once so i kept restarting then eventaully i decided to take it up agian after wasting a good 36 hours on the game getting annoyed that i was unable to solo missions and never seem to find a group the finding a group problem still persists occasionally but as of late from my standponit my current account is pretty much at the endgame level i cant get into pvp matches as easy as some my rating is just to high p so i started playing recently to find out that they released a new warframe the last time i played was during the mesa update i got some nice mods from that i like the encorperation of the new pvp game mode becuase replaying a mission only entertains you for so long things get repedative and hardly anyone did the conclave arenas clans had their own pvp areas for taking over dark sectors but i wasnt in a big clan just a small one that i was passed the ownership from a freind of mine so overall warframe is a pretty entertaining game when you have the time for it the event missions sure are intense i spent 10 hours trying to get those mods from the mesa update group after group ether failing instantly or at the last minute id go to help a fellow player and die thus losing the chance to get them as far as the pvp goes i would say for example the weapons that i use are pretty op so i feel bad when killing under geared players but overal its rather fun

pretty fun game to play to kill some time and have some good old fashioned coop fun you can choose to play alone with friends or with strangers the game isnt quite finished yet but i see a lot of good stuff in it already update its been quite awhile since i last played this game and holy crap its really grown this game is so much better than it was two years ago i was blown away when i returned to this game it has a story more tile sets more warframes more everything bravo devs i cant wait to see more from you guys
recommended
warframe has become quite the the most exciting game ive ever played so far so many things to to and the community isnt bad at all the dev team is quite active in fixing some bugs and are very detailed in the hot fix also one that caught my attention was the bug report when you untuck or get bigged in a game you report the bug you encounter in full detail and i believe this help the development of the game even further one of the most addicting game i ever played d
recommended
if you truly want to become a legendary ninja space warrior then download this game in an instant if not then youre quite mad
recommended
ive been pretty impressed with the quality of this game the replayability is pretty high as well because of how many warframes there are and how customizable your various loadouts can be given the many weapons mods and other options its also continuously updated and they actually fix bugs soon after i discover them which is really quite rare for a free to play
recommended
love this game yet after some time you desire to level more stuffbut there aint any fun game nonetheless ^^
recommended
a great coop online rpg featuring robot ninjas that can change character classes by switching warframes it should noted that this game is nothing but grind but an enjoyable grind
recommended
great game
recommended
this game is totally worth your time go & bring some friends along with you while playing the game this is a rare freetoplay mmo game which focus on coop instead of leveling system based rpg the controls are fluid and the game is surprisingly addictive there are tons of customization for you to make your character a badass alien ninja there are lots of content for you to explore go download it now 810

this is awesome  a nice shooter if you like teamwork and going through fights against random ai
recommended
great game for spare time  cool character and skills  bunch of weapons choice  recommended game d
recommended
this is a pretty fun game after you learn the ropes they have been improving the tutorial system since i first started but the beginning was pretty rough there is a lot content systems and mechanics that dont make immediate sense i loved the 200 missions that you can do the only downside to this is that there is a set amount of missions types so they become repetitive eventually also when youre done with all the missions youre not left with much to do other than trying to acquire rare weapons or warframes prepare for a grind how long you can enjoy that is up to each player i was fine for a while but it just gets old the dev team gives you weekly updatespatches and great support kudos to them for that its a f2p game pick it up play with some friends youll have fun
recommended
nice game
recommended
awesome game lots of stuff to do in it farm its always interesting and never gets bored nice tennoes and abilities theres things for everyone to like lots of missions gets better and better i recommend this game  
recommended
guns and suits are completely out of balance either overpowered or too weak but devs are too busy pumping out new content to fix that once you get to a certain point the challenge completely disappears and apparently people like it that way
recommended
this is a fun and fast moving game
recommended
welp the time has come for a review pros smooth gameplay awesome characters customizable tons of weapons new maps and characters added now and thenwhich is cool beautiful graphics cons you need to wait a little to build a new warframe or a new weapon but its ok its worth waiting andthats all from my personal experience _ died from shockwave moa bug got shot down from grineer ballista burned to crisp from grineer napalm ten out of ten would again die from all of these things so i can revive and kick their  back good jobi recomment this game to anyone who likes 3rd person shooter with a lot of guns customizasion and gameplay
recommended
one of the best games i playedits really fun and addicting especially with friends even when i get sometimes bored of this game i still come back to play sometime laterthe combat is funloads of guns and warframes to pick from tons of cosmetics to change up your character and the devs are releasing new content quite frequently  there is one downside thothere is a lot of grinding in this game  if you like 3rd person shooters where you have loads of classes abilities or if you just like space shooter gamesyou should totally check this game out  1010 would get bored and then play the game later again
recommended
warframe is a profoundly outstanding game with intensive coop action involving many strategical details especially being that there are many different type of missiontypes furthermore this game has amazing developers and graphics which go to show how shocking it is that this game is even free absolutely everything in this game is completely free while there is the option to buy platnium it is not needed due to the fact that you can use the trade market to selltradebuy items for platnium all in all this is a mustplay game and in my opinion is the best game out there especially against other freetoplay games
recommended
got it yesterday and i have already played it almost five hours p bes gem evur not really but i love it
recommended
ive started to play this game and its a great game but having a few issues in it overall i liked this
recommended
love the game it is great and has much potential for the future and i really hope that they add in the ability to swim because i am a bit tired of dying in water i want to swim like a fishy but this is still a great game and they can make it a lot better given time and the fact that it is free to play makes it even better anyone can get it and play just set up an account and enter the weapon variety is amazing and there is an amazing science fiction story line to it which instantly made me love this game i wish that there was some way to earn platinum through the game other than buying it or trading for it but when you earn that platinum it should be a small limited amount not an amount in the hundreds i absoulutly love this game
recommended
free to play game that is not pay2win you can get every payed item by building it in other words it doesnt force you to pay money to get the characters you want you can just play the game and build your way up to them

feels and plays like a destiny prototype with some minor bugs every now and then still tons of fun 8510

500 hour mark with this in mind i believe i can make a accurate review this game as of now 1242014 is still a beta in process to be a story filled mmo the basis is you use a character called a warframe to runs strikes on the solar system against arguably 10 factions 3 races and 3 different sets of bounty hunters you are reffered to as tenno the people of the lotus the tenno fight foragainst others to bring balance to the system you are awakened by the lotus to prevent from being captured by the grineer to be used and processed to be their weeaponslaveresource to gain universal domination as it were for the purpose of keeping from spoiling the game ill get into this this is a mmo this is not an easy mmo if you have deep pockets and believe in buying all great gear youll be highly dissapointed because theres this thing called xp locked that keep people like you from ruining this game and speed running it to be better than everyone else in fact the entire game is genuinly 100% free minus cosmetic items like color and skins etc everything in the game minus the cosmetic items can be obtained through simply playing ingame missions give credits which are used to build bluprints to beef your arsenal up there is a achievement labeled for having 10 warframes each tool with its own purpose this is true for the game slash damage shreds fleshy enemies to pieces but sheilded ones left unphased impact bomards shields but armor shrugs it off puncture you guessed it pierces armor but does a whole lot of nothing to shields sheilds save lives all tactics should be analyzed rank up is broken down as follows xp from primarysecondarymeleewarframespooled xpmastery rank the max rank for everything is level 30 including mastery rank if you level an item to 30 you will only recieve xp that counts that first time if you use forma to level it to zero to make it stronger later the other times after the first its leveled to 30 will not count toward your mastery rank every time you hit the xp cap for a mastery rank there is a right of passage type of test to rank if you fail you will be able to try again in 24 hours if you pass then you proceed to the next rank unlocking weapons and other new items there are plenty of weapons i promise you will not run out crafting this is easier than it sounds go do a mission and collect the drops the resources currently are gallium nano spores mutagen samples mutagen mass orokin cells polymer bundle alloy plate rubedo salvage detonite ample detonite injectors fieldtron samples fieldtron oxium nav coordinates nurodes neural sensors last two are not related to each other argon crystal control modules golem nav coordnate morphics cuircuts and plastids none of these are too difficult to find all are used from time to time for different items the more you have on hand the less as much as i hate saying it farming you have to do gamplay you are a space ninja thre is no better way to describe it you do flips wallruns slides and parcour of all kinds be it rolling from a fall or vaulting to a higher spot this is your deadliest weapon each warframe has unique abilities that they use they are described in the market or abilities option in your arsenal 90% of the game is pve clan battles that you arearent apart of you may assist for funcredit earnings conclave is also available as a deathmatch for a morepersonal 1v1 or 2v2 fight as a beta this game is a 1010 nyxsilence

warframe is the only game that is not a play to win but very much worth the money paying for only game ive spent money on besides dlc for other games
recommended
amazing game so much fun d[h1]
recommended
metacritic should review this game again
recommended
it is a fun game that makes you spend hours and hours on it i mean come on space ninjas hell yeah a little paidtowin yes but you can get the ingame currency with hard work too
recommended
highly recommended  what more can we say about this game that hasnt already been said  its an amazing f2p everything is obtainable through farminggrinding even the real currency youd buy with real money takes a bit of time and farming to actually get some decent stuff but its worth the trouble graphics wise its better than some $20$30 games out there and it keeps on getting better sure youll have glitches and bugs thats because the game is still in beta and many people seem to forget about it glitches and bugs get fixed over time the devs works hard for that 
recommended
hell yeah haha this game is too fun to be true
recommended
this is a really fun game to play with friends even though its only pve players vs enemies having a group to play with  clan makes it alot more fun be warned this is a pure farming game of repetitive play hence having groups of friends to play with makes it alittle more fun and after the latest new changes to the game it has become more user friendly and easier to understand with not as much farming needed as last time the game is still hella fun d
recommended
everyone says this game is like destiny i agree with that except warframe isnt
recommended
get this game if your even a gamer
recommended
my lifeit kinda left me for a few weeks
recommended
not bad at all really enjoy playing it and the graphics are amazing do i also need to mention that its free
recommended
an absolutly perfect game all around that everyone should try at least once
recommended
free to play in the right dirrection so many games that are free to play are like swimming with a lead life vest to get it off you have to pay for the key to properly stay afloat warframe has nothing like that they just put the islands far away as hell and you can choose at what pace you get to them with alot of f2p games 90% of the content is locked behind a wall of money but here its the opposite a vast majority of what you see is free frames characters are all attainable by grinding the pieces and resources needed to build them as goes with the weapons too by default you get one of the base frames and base weapons of your choice with the availability to get 1 aditional frame and eight weapons without paying a single dime with the starting free money they give you its possible to unlock additional frames and weapons spots to have more off the bat the only thing you cannot get free are color chemes some animations and so on but those are all asthetics its possible to play the game end to end without spending any money story is a general mmo stereotype you have control of a powerful character grindy missions save the universe ect not much more to it than that there are very few games i get headlong into the lore of and this is not one of them there may be more than what i said but i dont feel compelled to learn the in and out of every faction there are several starting story missions to get you the required gear to play any game type and an npc companion for free the combat is great controls are tight and responsive popping a headshot is easy the runslide and hump feels natural after a few minutes of gameplay the parkourwall running is a bit buggy but there is no penalty for falling out of bounds as it just pops you back into the level combat difficulty is a bit high later on into the games making it necessary to team up with others to help ease the load but you can jump into a game and play with random players if there are any for the selected mission weapon selection is a bit low as i love having hundreds of guns to play with but they have a decent selection of pistols rifles bows and ultimate prime weapons and power cards to make them all better as you level them up standard affair for weapons rifles snipers bows shotguns smgs and pistols graphics are great im running an nvidia 750 it runs on high settings but not ultra even so its a gorgeous game that looks beautiful through each planetlevel the levels are based off of tile sets and wind up being different missions constructed with the same pieces but a different lay out on each planetship you go through while level designs are endless you start to see alot of similarities over time even with the different variations of each right off the bat this isnt a game i play alot and usually with friends only i am hesitant about spending any money on it as this is more of a social game for me play with friends and have fun if this is your scene and you love the game to death theres nothing wrong with dropping full game price 60$ for the extra stuff as its a very well polished complete title that is worth that much at least as they add more things to do frames to play as you can go ahead and spend more on it i wont blame you however be warned there is several hundred dollars of content to buy if you dont want to grind out the supplies and frame blueprints warframe is bet played with patience and friends everything can be built immediately for platinum the real money currency or bought with it via the market or player trading it can take up alot of hours to get the characters and weapons if you dont want to spend any money off the bat everything aside from the color shcemes can be recieved in game with a bit of time and some higher level friends even if you dont know anyone that plays warframe there is a chat channel that you can ask to join in on higher level missions to level and get better items and resources from the start breakdown graphics 910 story 310 gameplay 910 reliability 810 fun 810 value 1110 quick breakdown be patient gets some friends this is a grindy game if you dont want to spend cash amazing graphics tight gameplay and 90% of the game content only costs time to get

i found this game to be a really good shooter and the parkor moves made it intresting to kill enemies in different ways graphics and gameplay are gorgeous and the different warframes can be easily identified by their abilities or looks there are regular events which allow access to one time weapons and badges and make a pleasant change to the normal gameplay the only dislike i have is the severe monetisation of everything if you want more warframes you can grind and build them for sure but you still have to purchase the slots to access them more guns more swords all good and well but you still have to pay to unlock slots to have them
recommended
good gameinteresting and good graphics

be prepared to spen over 100$ for the full expireience though its pretty neat for free too

this game is extremely unique it combines elements from many genres and combines them into a mixture that fits perfectly de made a game with pieces of scifi coop rpg third person shooters pvp pve and a very nice microtransaction system that works well together the store is another great thing about the game the prices are incredibly low compared to other games with the same cash system for example in league of legends a certain cosmetic skin could cost upwards of 20 dollars in this game a skin would cost around 5 dollars the shop allows players to access items faster but it allows people to obtain the items through playing the game as well thereby removing any pay to win factor in summary this game is a combination of elements that equals a fantastic experience that everyone should be a part of
recommended
no this game blew up my pc then starting a fire which burned down my house and killed my family 1110 would play this again
recommended
no russians here

mmmmmmm high speed shooter action if you step into warframe expecting to play something akin to a traditional shooter youre going to be a bit disappointed warframe amps it up with the addition of parkour elements as well as make it viable by leaving a ton of shortcuts around for people who want to explore randomly generated levels multiple game types a newly revamped pvp and constant updates make warframe a constantly evolving shooter experience and worth a try for anyone
recommended
for a freetoplay warframe is a  actionpacked shootemup that doesnt disappoint with dynamic diving wallrunning sliding and genreally traversing surfaces warframe lives out the experince of a spacefaring gun toting  as you fight disgusting s with no sense of personal hygeine some cheap rip off from mass effect and some humanaliencyborgbill murray offspring warframe allows medicore coop gameplay with millenia of survival extermination high class drug sessions sabotage and other mission classes definately a solid 5810 must die see you in the system you ing prick  you

although the game does have dlcs it does not affect the gameplay at all i still use the suit i got when i started playing the game a long time ago and i still top the scoreboard on missions the enemies are unique you have the mutated creaturesi really prefer calling them space zombies and those weird ugly faced green armor dudes a really good game if you ask me

< look at my in game hours yeah it really is that good chop it up or shoot it blast it with your powers or run away from it the inclusion of clans make this game easy to come back to over and over if starting make sure you get in with a good clan and get involved youll enjoy the game so much more as tutorialwise it is pretty lacking

grinding this game is more of an accomplishment than grinding your girlfriend in which i dont have ironic

its ok
recommended
okay so i was jumping into this game knowing nothing but from the gameplay trailer and i was expecting an undeveloped story and another fps game but this game was anything but that this game is a massive mm0 game which you play as one of three amazing classes all with unique gameplay styles and weapons theres a wide variety of customization and a very wide one of weapons heck the starter weapons are really good in a lot of cases and the story was very well developed but it wasnt like a mindblowing story it was just a great freetoplay story i highly recommend this game to anyone no matter what you think youll probably be blown away the only complaint i have is it takes some time to get used to the controls and it requires a lot of grinding to level up and get different weapons my rating 8810 get this game
recommended
not perfect but definitely improved since beta which made me quit the game after a mere few hrs picked up again and im vomiting rainbows from how much better it is now gr8 m8 88
recommended
its a good time if you know what youre getting yourself into this game is extremely grindy but i certainly dont mind because the core gameplay is solid and enjoyable albeit with a few snags here and there there are warframes to suit darn near every playstyle out there and the 3 frames you get to choose from at the beginning reflect this well most importantly every warframe and every weapon can be acquired without spending a cent this is where the grinding comes in you have to have patience and play the game of course if you dont have patience you can always just buy some platinum and spend that on warframes weapons and various cosmetic goodies instead

i have 3 words to say  really epic game
recommended
gameplay is very casual coop fun  in a similar vein to left 4 dead only with cyborg space magic ninjas vs robots infested alien zombies and power armoured humans wall run backflip and slide your way parkourstyle through levels gameplay is very much style over substance  you repeatedly sprint hack and shoot your way through somewhat repetitive levels  hopefully with friends where it shines is the casualfriendly coop and surprisingly deep customisation the tenno ninja suits can be equipped with a vast array of perks and abilities and upgrading and swapping these is a minigame in itself surprisingly good for a freetoplay game
recommended
its an ok game could be better
recommended
there are some games that show that free to play still has something fun to offer warframe is one of those titles coop ninja beat em up or shoot em up the downside is that the game kinda tries to push you to buy platinum game money currency by putting kinda of ridiculous real world hours to build something besides that you can have all things in the game besides cosmetic without paying a cent
recommended
nice graphic and optimization for my crappy laptop 1010

probably one of the best games ive ever played 800 hrs on record

recommended
great game my only problem is that i cant restart if you play this make your character wisely unless you want to have tomake a new warframe acount to restart plus you can only have 1 account per email that means to restart you have to create a new email so you can use it to make an account other then that it a great gameyou can be sneaky or go in guns blazing probably best to chose the right build for sneak or guns blazing

i have searched for a good combat mmo game aside from the popular console call of dutyhalo ect for a long time and i have finaly found one stratagy combat skills construction critical thinking lore all in one game the devs are always coming up with ways to add to the game or expand the games lore universegameplay so the game is always evolving the user base is for the most part supportive and friendly and unlike most games i have tried the elitist jerk few cant set up roadblocks to the common player base and make thier gameplay miserable and unfruitful a word of warning becasue the game is always evolving it is natural that bugs come with that territory players affectionatly call it bugframe or crashframe becasue of it but in my opinion the rewarding gameplay is worth it a word on its free 2 play status as there is much critizism especailly after 150 update although there are some limitations at trying to running it f2p it can be done game currency can be earned thru the player trading system game currency only items can be earned in the game although takes more timein less quantity and certain items can be traded for things you want but cant get if you do decide to put some money in the game a little goes a long way and there is discount coupons all the time

warframe is all about the suit or frame you choose to wear the weapons you choose to equip and hanging out with your friends or clanmates in one of the best mmo shooters to be available in years the number of options you have with freetoplay are staggering compared to any other game i have played the developers are always on top of hotfixes and when they arent busy fixing things they are truly working to expand and make the game even better it is an awesome community and i highly recommend adding this game to your permanent library

good game but very hard when u try to solo missions especially when u have to get the collar for the kubrow i have one and its been sitting there for the past couple days because i cant complete the mission but if u have friends this game can be very fun
recommended
awesome game at the same time one of the games where you have to farm like endlessly you can easily get atleast 500 hours of gameplay and even then you wont be able to have everything you want after like 800 hours of gameplay when you have everything unlocked it gets very boring because youre forced to do the same stuff over and over but still the developers constantly release new updates which unlocks new stuff into the game and gives you the chance to pour more hours of gameplay into warframe
recommended
in a game where futuristic spacesuited rebels called warframes must protect the universe from the evil you play as one of the many various frames to choose from the game starts out a bit confusing and can be quite challenging but if you hang in there and really pay attention to tutorials this becomes what i consider to be one of the best free to play games ever made with a very vast choice in how youd like to play as well as how you look weapons you use and what type of mission you like to do warframe is one hell of a great game if you havent given this fantastic game a try make sure that is on your soon todo list and if you have only played a few hours and are having a rough time go to youtube there are litterally thousands of helpful tutorials the same can be said for the websites forums

ignore what people say about microtransactions i have been playing for over 300 hours and have some of the best gear in the game i have only spent about $10 and that was on cosmetics anyone should get this game they wont regret it

warning this game is slow at first but it rewards the player with grinding as long as you find a good clan all will be well

warframe is extremely fun if you know how to spend your money well say youre making dough every day because youre ofc a pimp and you decide that  this  i aint grinding to get stuff imma buy it dont purchase platinum to buy weapons from the store or frames for the store you are losing the experince for the journey towards that frame although once you have most of the good weapons it does kinda get boring still extremely addicting

warframe is a game where you beat them up and you gain levels quite like destiny actually even thought warframe has some graphics that are way to buggy with the lighting it is an amazing game four player and has raids not including its always running nonstop bringing us new content every day hotfixes and even more stuff that people just love warframe has its own motivations for being such a great game itself lets talk about the basics number 1  its a free to play game and number 2  you can meet new people anytime anywhere warframe is amazing and i dont know what to say about it warframe is a game where everything happens scifi from nightmare to infested goop warframe has it all oh and did i mention its a free to play warframe is amazing and i recomend trying this game out at least 5 times if you dont like it just say it
recommended
a sciencefiction thirdperson shooter that blows away most other cooperative titles this game has everything you need to enjoy hours upon hours of coop fun with friends that is if you are looking for a game that offers coop shooting with a crafting system and player build customization the draw backs of this game are few but they include some really long grinds repetitive gameplay and a premium pay to grindless scheme that being said the game is truly fun and is a freetoplay so premium grindless is something that should be obvious the one note i will mention which has been the main driving factor for me and my friends slowing off this game is the constant repetitive gameplay that has diminishing returns that coupled by the fact that items ingame that contribute to your overall level and progression mastery are often having the ability to attain them removed from the game which in my mind is contributing to permanent player inequality the mere fact that i cannot receive an item that would contribute to my overall level in the community because i either wasnt playing when it was introduced or missed the opportunity to receive it greatly hinders my will to proceed further based on the merit of completion some may not have a problem with this but others certainly do certain practices i dont quite agree with also include the prime access packs mainly in the area of pricing so to put it bluntly this is an overly adequate game for your time if you so wish to play it there are things that after playing for a while you may realize you dont like but to each his own live long and kill the masses

after picking it back up again after a few months of it getting repetetive warframe has evolved quite a bit gameplay wise it is fantastic very smooth and many manuevers to pull off however it can still become repetitive after a while the depth of the game is better a lot of weapons and frames to choose from all providing unique experiences and evolving combat again and again however a drawback is it appearing pay to not grind as much which puts you in the lategame much faster however there is a huge lack of lategame content in the first place you dont have to pay to be able to max out or anything but paying sure makes life easier such as more warframe slots weapon slots and sentinels the game becomes a grind quickly without paying and having to wait such a long time for built weapons and warframes becomes a drag the lack of level versatility gets annoying but is overseeable warframe is a game that may hold your attention for a few days or even weeks but you wont be able to play it for a long period of time as the game doesnt warrant it without any lategame content or gamemode that hooks you in conversely it it extremely fun to play especially with friends it is worth it for the simple experience of being a ninja in space alone 710
recommended
such a great game gives the feel of destiny but actually way better because there is a dedicated support team gets repetitive at times but there is a lot to work towards in the game
recommended
very fun coop game with quite a bit of utility also a great game to play and do stuff with your freinds
recommended
feels repetitivebut it has such good design and gameplay i want to play it but i get bored hopefully warframe will update a bit more to change my mind for now id say its pretty good pretty cool gameplay
recommended
updated well its been a long time since i last reviewed warframe and its amazing how much better the game has become since then its smoother and much more optimised although me getting an upgraded pc helped and there is so much more content than before its still basically the same old grindfest and its still almost impossible to find pickup groups for normal mission progression but with so many new mission types areas enemies factions the archwing which reminds me so much of zone of the enders theres actually a hell of a lot to do the game still goes out of its way to screw you if you insist on trying to play for free but you can get around if if youre bloodyminded enough a tentative recommendation
recommended
1010 this game is amazinggraphics goodlots of weapons its not a p2w you just need to farm quite a bit
recommended
one sentence terribly addicting
recommended
ive had so much fun playing this game and will continue to do so it may be repetative to alot of people but i think it is managable and you can get anything in the game for free if you are willing to put the effort in wich is great and i wish more games would impliment this
recommended
manthis is a good game with a good graphic

warframe how do i put this warframe is an excellent game and that is putting it lightly warframe is basically about futuristic space sci fi that involves humanity becoming mutated and corrupted the main characters you play as are called warframes which are like awesome space ninjas they are basically either super evolved technology that is worn to keep the corrupted humans or tenno stable or they are the result of mutations to the tenno either way they each have their own unique looks and powers you can customise your ones to your own liking and desire you play the game by doing missions these involve you flying down to a planet in your spaceship then depending on what mission type you are doing you must complete the main objective an example of this includes exterminate missions these missions are your typical and easier missions in my opinion basically the main objective is to go all space ninja on all the enemies till none of them are left standing seems simple enough the more harder missions can include defense or spy missions i wont go too much into what they are as to not spoil the entire game for you new players ive been playing this game for a good few years and it just seems to get better and better as the time goes on the developers add new content at a decent pace and keep us the consumer interested it really keeps me enjoying myself to fullest at every corner however there is only 1 problem with this game in my opinion this problem seems to occur in most free to play games im refering to of course pay to play issue now unlike world of warcraft and other free to play games warframe does allow you to get the complete experience of the game for free they allow this by letting players doing the missions and farming parts of weapons cosmetics even other warframes you can build and obtain for no real money what so ever yay and for those lazy players who cant be stuffed to put the time into farming for the things they want we are able to buy whatever we want for real money a tactical advantage to the devs but can be worth it for us sometimes however there is a catch to those of us who want to get the stuff for free and this is the problem i was refering to that is how the game works with this sure put hours on end to farm the parts and make your new weapons and warframes etc but each warframe weapon etc needs a slot to be placed in within your inventory and guess what that costs real money to get more hahahahaha what a messed up catch sure its not as expensive as buying the thing you want in the first place but its still really cheeky on the devs part letting people get whatever they want for free only to spend cash for space in their iventory to aquire this so called free {whatever you are building}  oh and when you build the stuff for free it does take real hours to be made just another set back for some people me im not as fussed about that as others but besides that little cheeky issue with having to buy slots to put the stuff you want for free in i have absolutley nothing bad to say about warframe its a wonderful game and like i previously mentioned it keeps getting better to some degree d and as such i look forward to the future sessions of playing warframe that are yet to come would i recommend this game hell yeah no questions asked i think the majority of gamers out there would love this if you are a player that doesnt like spending real money on games you already bought then i dont think youd like this too much but other then that d absolutley i recommend this 
recommended
warframe is what you expected halo to be and what destiny should have been
recommended
so the reason ive dicided to do this reveiw now is because of the recent update which has drastically changed my opinion of warframe but ill come back to this later so first off what is warframe basically its a free to play 3rd person coop action shooter with ninjas with a bonus of using swords and lots and lots of other weapons d but the game can also be labbled as a mmo due to its high focus on loot and grinding but the main focus is the actual warframes themselves combat suits with a wide variation of abilitys ranging from invisibility fireballs healing and even teleportation these suits also allows for a ton of parkour moves and melee strikes for when your out of bullets first off things that warframe dose well or differently than other games overall warframes combat a basically rock solid although new players or potential players might find it very basic and it is very basic indeed and boring even repeditive the secret to its combat however is its versitility especially with the new update 13 and melee 20 which revamps melee combat to make it more viable it requires you to creativly use all your abilitys weapons and manouvers warframe also brings this kind of variation to almost everything else almost tons of enemy variations and classes and random tile sets will ensure that even vateran players keep on their toes although ussually bullets will do the job  the biggest plus this game has however is the constant update of content and special events massive content patchs ussually come around ever other month or so and there will be a ton of special events for those who keeps ther eyes and ears open and they offer a ton of awsome loot as for cons there is only one i would mention above all else micrtransaction noooooooo for a game that lables itself as f2p it dosent lie almost all content in avalible to find in game excluding even items and most cosmetics and boosters xp and in game currency however for those who are of the impatient types youll likely drop $10 or more this con is easily passible but there is a ton of upgrade materials that can be purchased with cash and they dont come cheap especially the pre built weapons and warframes on the topic of building you can expect a lot of crafting counters some lasting as little as 1 minute to 3 days just remember to be pacient and take your time  aslo warframe offers little in mechanic explations other than a very basic combat tutrorial youll have to discover everything else on your own there is also a slight lack in mission variety but there are new game modes being added reasonably quickly as my final verdict i strongly recomend anyone give this game a try at least for a few hours and who knows you might like it enough to put down $60 like me yes i know i said its a con but i was worth it and so i bestow upon warframe a 78 out of ten its a solid 3rd person action f2p shooter with solid combat and great coop and a ton of new content being added all the time but watch out for those microtransactions they can stack up pretty quickly 
recommended
that moment when you get ash p sys but your host is so bad that everyone dcs except the host difficulty level way harder than dark souls
recommended
easily enjoyable easily repeated not unlike playing your average call of duty game  very repetitive yet still very stimulating except this game is played in the 3rd person above a space ninja with special abilities very scientifically fictional but with storylinelike objectives thus making it about 510x more interesting than any of the call of duty games combined i recommend this piece of digital art to those who are easily stimulated by simple combustible ranged weapon combatant violence gunfights  parkour  shooter that is better than ever before
recommended
awesome game and its free to play
recommended
awesome game countless hours of joyful killing very  very  wide range of weapons and abilities as well as optional parkour for those who like it who doesnt awesome devs regular new content as well as special events not only is it not pay2win but the customization items can be obtained for free as the premium money used in the shop is the only currency tradable between players so youll make some of it simply by selling items you loot ingame
recommended
its a third person shooter featuring ninjas in space do i really need to say any more endless weapon choices and tons of different warframes your primary kit of abilities is your warframe in this game so the game never gets boring i highly recommend it
recommended
i would recommend this game to people who are willing to spend a lot of money on things like customization and upgrades unless you can enjoy the standalone fun of the free game
recommended
takes smoe getting used to but fun to play esp with others
recommended
the game looks wonderful and fun gameplay but the repetition of scenarios bores anyone over time but anyway take a look you wont regret it
recommended
this is some next level matrix 
recommended
its a game about space ninjas space ninjas frickin space ninjas on a more serious note to me it seems like a perfect blend of gameplay from gunz the duel the original not the trainwreck of a sequel and the scifi epicness of mass effect it also clearly hides the grindfest  to a degree
recommended
this game is amazing 
recommended
there are a lot of free to play games out there that either feel unpolished or pay to win if you like shooters or you like rpgs this is a great game to try out its constantly updated with new content so theres always something to do you can create or join a clan and build or help a clan build your own dojo which is awesome theres a currency you can buy with real money but it can also be earned in game by trading with other players giving them some extra parts you dont need when you craft things you can rush it with platinum which almost turned me away at first because i thought it would be as annoying as those mobile apps with rush but i got used to it short after and started to barely even notice since i passed the time doing fun missions to get a free affinity xp booster and create a warframe account you can get reffered by me httpswarframecomsignupreferrerid51db64511a4d80e32e000002

alright i have lots to say about this game it is super enjoyable and easy with at least 1 friend amazing parkour and movement features now i will say this takes a very long time to collect materials for an item and even longer to actually make the item but its a very fun journey getting the materials the campain is very fun and the pvp is alright now the reason i say that the pvp is alright is because this game is paytowin its very easy to become very successful by spending around 50 dollars into this game the game does have some really good graphics and i do suggest this game who is into facepace third person shooters 810

this is not my type of game at all i normally play skyrim rogue legacy miasmata not shooters and definitely not mmo shooters doesnt matter ive clocked upwards of 300 hours in it because it is just that much fun the game is not about grinding its not about the things you can buy in the shop for cash sure you can drop a ton of money to instantly have all the things that otherwise you have to acquire partbypart in missions but what fun is that virtually every item in the shop drops in missions the ones that dont often come up as special alerts theres no need to spend a single dime  within a week or two you can potentially have an extremely buffedout character that can take on anything the universe throws at it space ninjas so again its not about grinding its about having a fantastic time running along walls vaulting over enemies and mowing them down in whirlwinds of deadly blades bullets magnetic crossbow bolts explosions and a whole host of unique powers you can play stealth brute force tricks and traps there are different warframes for pretty much any playstyle you can run solo  there are missions that are very hard to complete that way but i did a lot of soloing at first and had a great time but you can also take advantage of an excellent missionpairing system to drop into anything you want to play with whoever else happens to be playing it get a bad team yeah you might wipe but most missions are brief  youre probably out a few minutes time ive had some real horrors as runs go but ive had vastly more good groups whod learned the ropes and were actively excellent to work with get a good group going and the game helps you out  the dynamics of attack defense support are highly organic and fluid you learn what makes up a good team and how to back up the different types of companions you might have along the way and if worst comes to worst even on a bad team everyone gets the rewards theyre not split up or voted on you just get what you pick up weaponry is elaborate and extensive and different weapon types have significantly different impact it really makes a difference whether youre running with a set of daggers a long sword fist weapons or a staff sniper rifles machine guns and straightup regular rifles all demand their own kind of tactical attention add that to an incredible array of mods a sort of ingame ccg you can use to buff and modify each weapon and your warframe and the possibilities are virtually endless  just fiddling with mods is its own little minigame one ive sunk far too much time into and dont regret a bit also dont want to pay for cash shop items with real money no problem theres a lively trade in modsforplatinum  you never have to spend a real dime the controls and ui are quite elegant and improving yes youre playing a parkourenthusiast space ninja whats your point when youve sunk some time into it you start learning how to polish your own playstyle and thats a huge part of the fun  the game actively rewards using what you can do with it you can run on run up bounce off of just about any surface and there are a variety of powers that enhance these abilities not to mention innate differences in the warframes mastery of the controls is important but not hard to get used to running a mission well  figuring out how to use the maps to your advantage how best to tackle different enemy situations are all part of the learning process which is why this isnt about grinding at all  if youre not having fun running missions for their own sake rather than the rewards youre missing the whole point are there bad points sure yes theres sometimes lag its a natural downside of hosting on one of the participants machines i havent had a lot of trouble with it and its just one mission  outside survivaldefense they generally last ten or fifteen minutes its not a big deal yes there are bugs yes sometimes theyll cost you a mission your rewards time rebooting the game sure ive said some bad words when one hit me but for the most part theyre transient and as a programmer i get it theyre under incredibly active development putting out releases at an astonishing rate and each new thing is a shiny new toy i get to play with ill take the shiny new toys over perfect programming any day of the week warframe is a really good game  in my books i highly recommend giving it a try

theres no reason not to try this one it has enjoyable combat as well as an addictive upgrade system its a game where you get to play a frickin space ninja and it follows through perfectly try it out 300 hours later and i still havent spent a dime on platinum ingame currency although i am planning on buying some merely to support the developers you know its f2p done right when you can play over 300 hours and not need to spend a single cent admittedly it can get repetitive but as long as you dont burn yourself out by playing nonstop this is a musthave for any steam library
recommended
a scifi fast past shooter and slasher game with ninjas but the only thing thats kind of a downside for this game is almost every thing requires real money to get the best armor and weapons for your character

this is an updated version of my old review introduction warframe is a f2p title devloped by digital extremes the studio that brought us dark sector this game is an direct sequel to dark sector taking place in the same universe set many hundred years into the future after the events of dark sector you are a tenno a member of an ancient warrior race that have been awoken from their cryosleep only to find the universe they have sworn to protect in chaos and disarray its now up to you and your fellow tenno to restore balance to this system and discover more about your past for the cryosleep has stangely purged you of such for more information on the lore of the tenno and the warframe universe please visit the wiki httpwarframewikiacomwikitenno general gameplay review now onto the actual review part warframe is a coop third person action rpg set in the distant future of the dark sector universe and has you take up the role as one of the previously mentioned tenno the gameplay of warframe is similar to its predecessor dark sector while also introducing fast paced parkour elements into the game and taking many ques from mass effect 3 its multiplayer giving the players access to class specific powers or in this case warframe specific powers warframes are the games exo suits or heroes that give the players a selection of 4 abilities per warframe each warframe having a unique art style theme and playing style to them allowing you to fill many different roles within your squad while the game has satisfying coop gameplay this game really is a loot based one at its heart youll be picking up mods to improve your weapons resources to build new weapons warframes etc in your foundry and also leveling up said weapons and warframes during your gameplay youll be visitng many unquie planets and locations during your quests across our solar system from the icy planet of pluto the lush rain forests of earth to the floating gas cities of saturn at times the end game grind can be abit too much for some people but if you are a hardened veteran of games like wow diablo or borderlands youll find that this is not as extreme as said games but the fact that the grind compares favorably to these nonf2p games is a saving grace however if you dont want to grind you can always hit up the trade chat and try to trade your hard earned mods parts or blueprints for the things you might need or perhaps even earn yourself alittle platinum while doing so which brings me to my last and biggest point id like to touch on business model review the business model now warframe has a pretty fair business model while you can craft everything in the game in the foundry you can also buy those items with the real money currency called platinum this currency can be obtained by purchasing it with real money or by trading for it with other players with platinum you buy things such as warframesweapons skins & cosmetics extra warframeweapon slots expmoney boosters or rush the construction of items in your foundry  purchasing a warframe or weapon follows around the same pricing model as lol has for its heroes or skins so it is pretty fair as far as f2p goes verdict as of the time of this review i have 1300 hours clocked into this game since its release on steam and probably about 200 hours in the nonsteam closed beta and i have founded the game through closed beta with one of the founders packs master founder while i cant say that this game is perfect or flawless with the previously mentioned end game grind that might get a bit tiresome for some people or the business model which might annoy you i however will still say that this game is a great f2p title and amongst one of the most fair ones at that overall warframe is a great f2p game with a loving devloper behind it who continuously reach out the community put up amazing ingame events host livetreams to share what is comming up and discuss recentupcomming changes with the community all while also answering the hard questions that we ask them so if this game sounds interesting go and give it a look afterall ninjas play free also pink shorts

my updated review to warframe the game has improved 110% since the earlier beta stages there are now practically 0 errors and the steam overlay is completely cooperative and helpful the guides available give a starter and veterans alike a sense of understanding the game playing to your strengths and improving weaknesses warframe connections are much better established although rarely youll join an unoptimized session but the negatives in regard to the positive are completely null pros overall great gaming experience high fps great use of computer mechanics great choice of playstyle amazing choice of weapons how and what you want to play as expanded mission base as well as amazing replay value once mission stage is complete good growing group of followers and players doesnt feel like its in beta improvements through regular updates improve the game tenfold would highly recommend this free to play visually stunning game that deserves high scores in critical reviews

ive had warframe for a long time but didnt really get into it till september 2014 there are so many things you have to learn and understand at the beginning which makes it a little hard but once you understand everything this game is worth your while good graphics good gameplay a whole ton of missions and planets to explore i recommend warframe anyday 8410
recommended
absolutely amazing very wide choice of weapons and warframes each with its own individual abilities customization is too big to handle that is why it is very hard to get bored of this game with its up to notch gameplay and excellent game mechanics i still got tired of warframe for a bit and here is a kicker i had few months of break from this game i came back and there was so much new content that i felt like im playing a brand new game that i never touched before new weapons warframes environments new missions enemies everything new the big part of warframe is evolution and progress of its universe and gameplay it keeps the game fresh and exciting that is why evolving scifi world is a big thing about this game and it keeps on evolving recommended to anyone and everyone who enjoys tps action games scifi and ofccourse parkour elements d mirrors edge can feel ashamed by warframe d

all i can say from this game iswait no i am left speechless this game is the best game out there that i have seen in a long time from the moment you wake up from your cryopod all the way to when you reach outer terminus this game is amazing incredibly fast and intense third person shooter one tihng this game has and that is teamwork use your powers and skills of weaponry i would highly recommend this game zyrohunters score 1010 heck make it 1110

addictive game so far

warframe feels like a game about grinding and leveling up you find resources by completing missions that you can use to craft new weapons equipment and character warframes to level up enemies drop mods infrequently that you use to constantly power up your arsenal theres absoulutely sometehing to be said about warframes ability to continue to be interesting and fun despite the repeetition of some missions no doubt owed to the comfortable and varied gunplay mechanics the complicated damage system [img1wikianocookienet]  clever acrobatic techniques and variety of endgame content the gameplay is fast and intense and the matchmaking is solid enough to allow seamless cooperative play with friends or strangers the game is free to play so id recommend it if you want to see how a truely fair f2p business model works everything is obtainable without a credit card aside for cosmetics and shortcuts to equipment
recommended
its a very nice game but it s a little bit strong
recommended
incredibly fun although it is repetative each time you play it feels like a different game
recommended
ive only just started to play this game  now sorry for this to sound like a paid ign review but its how i feel about the game so far  very fast fluid combat lots of customization amazing graphics and most importantly alot of fun its best to play with people friends cap obvious here on the down side the enemys are really dull the game can get some what repetitive with escort quest  defend this while wating for that but dont let that cloud your mind warframe is still an amazing game and if you have the chance defitenly check it out
recommended
great game but if you have epilepsy dont play this game
recommended
ninjas in spaaaaaaccce warframe works best as a 4 player coop among friends it is possible to enjoy solo with the right setups it is more difficult to enjoy as a new player teaming up with randoms as each mission tends to be a competitive kill rush however for the most part players seem understanding and helpful there are annoying bugs but developers update frequently with both fixes and new content maps items and events cheating exists but much of the game happens server side and due to the central coop nature it seems to be rare and less frustrating automated banning occurs for more egregious cheating warframe has one of the better free to play models i have seen new players are given some platinum currency at the start most if not all items are obtainable without spending with the exception of inventory slots and cosmetics
recommended
good game especially for a free to play it does begin to get repetitive after a bit though
recommended
it is a very good game and i am enjoying every minute of it d
recommended
the best game  great graphicgreat gameplay great people didnt you play it go for it
recommended
cool
recommended
possibly one of the greatest games i have ever played this is also the only game on steam which i have over 200 hours of game time warframe plays great and feels rewarding this game is a legend and deserves the respect and support that it has if you like being the ultamite space death machine play this game
recommended
have you ever wanted to kill giant robots from mars with a stick you made from garbage you found on uranus wel now you can space ninjas thats all i need to say to get you to install but its also free so theres that too install or go back to your lame game that doesnt involve punching aliens in the face this has got to be one of my favorite games
recommended
very cool futuristic enviorment crippled by samey repetive gunplay and lots of grinding 710 ninjas play free
recommended
i really enjoy this game graphicly its way above your average f2p also paying real money for things doesnt mean much since you dont typically fight each other this is a coop based game there is an option that you can duel with others but it has to be an accept action no one will just jump out of nowhere an kill you midmission there is a little bit of a learning curve getting used to the controls and an even greater one for a controller in my opinion when bad guys drop stuff everyone shares the loot you only see the stuff on your screen but everyone gets the same thing this game has kind of an mmo feel with some of the grinding involved but its done in an entertaining way as far as using your real money equivilant platinum you start with i recommend buying an extra slot for a suit and slots for weapons they are contantly updating this game which makes it continually enjoyable the improvements that are done for updates can sometimes change the whole dynamics of how you play your character fortunately enough i havent seen an update yet that has frustrated me into not playing anymore but instead curious about how to utilize the new system
recommended
this game is very underrated it deserves a higher meta score than it has a lot of the negative reviews were back when the game was much older and offered less they dont represent the game now excellent coop mostly bugfree smooth controls outstanding graphics tons of weapons upgrades and customization get pretty much anything you can buy with the store credit in game also except warframe and weapon slots i think oh and replayablity i have been playing this game for a long time they are always adding new modes that refresh the expereince i cant recommend it enough 8510
recommended
can use ninja skills to troll 1010 would play again
recommended
i cant stop playing dis  help
recommended
before you decide to jump into warframe you must understand what the game is it is a massive grind fest many people are turned off because of how repetitive it is most of the time you will be doing the same thing for hours at a time leveling and farming for materials it will get old for people who dont enjoy this type of play style all of the items in the game aside from some cosmetic things are obtainable through means of farming and crafting that is where 75% of your play time will be spent while 25% will be spent on leveling said items that said if you enjoy any grindfest i recommend warframe space ninjas guns warframe
recommended
i just got this game and im hooked this is going on my top 5 list
recommended
pretty fun all around general frames and weapons are reasonable to farm with the exception of a small few game starts out abit slower since the mods are what will give your weapons and frame the edge but once you get thru most of the planets and some beginning voids you should be pretty good only really grindy part in general are aquiring the prime weapons and frames game is fast paced and levels are randomly generated prebuilt sections combined together that for the most part dont feel too much like youre doing the same stage over and over beginner tips roll excalibur generally the caster frames arent good until you get the energy cost down on them so you can use them more often use your available plat to buy more warframe and weapon slots being able to bring a variety of toys to the party is what makes later game more interesting as each frame has a different play style to it also if youre interested shoot me a message and ill shoot you a recruitment gives you a few days of bonus credit & xp gain which youll need

this game is amazing i dont need to tell you the reader to download this game just do it ok now to write a serious review kind of thingy the gameplay is fluid and smooth it feels to me being predominantly a xbox player like a mixture of halo and titanfall but in thirdperson and a lot more fast paced and energetic than both of those games either way the variety between frames and weapons is great but there are some exceptions of weapons that are just weaker versions of other weapon cough akzani and akstilettos but other than those there isnt much in the way of simular weaponry the gunplay is brilliant all the guns that ive tried anyway feel great to use and have the oomph that really make them feel effective aswell as being effective the game looks great from a graphical standpoint the music is spectacular and the sound effects make the weapons sound beefy and feel great to use aforementioned above since the title update 14 came out not long back the game is more beginner friendly and there isnt a better time to start playing now the bad points that need to be present in every review the business model for the game is pretty bad you as the player will require to buy slots for warframes and weapons to be able to build half of the things that you would want say that you had a set of weapons that you really like and you threw an orokin catalyst maybe a forma or two on each of them and then you see another weapon that seems interesting to you or want to try it and see what the fuss is all about but you have no slots and you cant claim the weapon until you sell one of you hard earned or you buy some slots to get more there is always the option not to but if you dont then you will be limited to a small amount of warframes and weapons its the same situation with warframes and in my opinion it subtracts from the overall enjoyment of the game if you have this limitation of having two warframes and eight weapons my next point is the waiting time for building weapons frames and some materials like forma and fieldrons fieldrons can also be obtained from invasions as with detonite injectors but since it is a freetoplay game this sort of thing is inevitable simular to the buying of slots weapons and frames on the subject of buying weapons and frames and other accessories that can be bought with the paid for currency platinum most weapons and frames can be bought with platinum and this sort of thing can lead to a pay to win basis but some of the best gear in the game primes can only be found in the higher tier missions in the orokin void but they can also be bought with prime access which involves the buyer spending a large amound of money for the latest primes that have been released and some other exclusive accessories that can only be obtained with the prime access yes i agree that this is either pay to win or breeching what is or isnt pay to win but this is the sort of game where equipment isnt everything and skill can play a big factor in who would be the highest performing player in the mission some more good points and a general rap up of the review you must be a champ to get this far a good majority of the games weapons and warframes can be bought with platinum but if you have mods and prime parts to sell people in the trade chat will gladly buy those off of you for platinum or high tier mods and or prime parts so arguably the game can be effectively played with spending any money on it at all having started my own clan in the game the clan tech research is a fun thing which can be done on top of all the other things that are done in the game also there is customizing the clan dojo itself which can take a very long time to achieve anything in conclusion im 327 hours in to the game and i have enjoyed every minute of it i have spent 30 $50 on the game that was enough for me to get all the weapons and frames that i wanted and some materials on top of that to help with the dojo and the construction of my zephyr warframe my philosophy is that if you got at least 1 hour of entertainment for for 1 you spent on the game then you have got you moneys worth out of the game lastly i fully recommend this game to anyone out there who has the pc to run the game which i may add doesnt require a great pc to run so come join us tenno for further information visit httpwarframewikiacomwikiwarframe_wiki or httpsforumswarframecom

this is a very addictive game and quite literally half the time i am saying how much i love it because everyone can be good at this game as it is against ai rather than other players for me atleast making it more relaxing and less stressful at times only complaint could be the obvious repetition required to get through the game
recommended
best game ever i dont even need to review just download it already
recommended
grindy but pretty fun and good looking isnt even that harware hungry either
recommended
if you enjoyed mass effect 3 multiplayer then you need to play this this is as close to f2p as youll find with the current generation of games where in game microtransactions buy you nothing but stuff that you could farm for yourself within the first dozen or so hours of play except for vanity items and colour palettes and the option to add additional weapon and warframe slots if you want them for everything else its just a shortcut saving a few days at most with rushed build times on items and really doesnt impact the game unless youre terminally impatient solo play is viable and fun coop is enjoyable and expands upon the experience and clan play makes accessing content with friends pretty simple the game is largely engineered for pve but the option for pvp on a scale that really affects the gameplay of every other player is available the devs seem very fun and in touch with their players and they seem to have a good feel for exactly how much to give a player at any time seriously the game is free as in really properly viably free and enjoyable even if you keep playing for free its not the biggest download in the world you really should give it a go
recommended
i realy like this game
recommended
if your a fan of scifi shooters or third person shooters you should swing on over and try warframe with silky smooth visuals and fast paced parkour the game has lots of potential as a third person shooter that you can enjoy but sadly its one major drawback is that it can be repetitive and the textures and enemies can feel overused and boring if you play a lot as of 522014 i want to add that they have added a lot of things to the game since the review was first made so go check it out edit warframe has had a bunch of really cool updates since this review was first published i am pretty amazed at how far warframe has come since i first got my hands on it in beta
recommended
best f2p ive played in a long time amazing graphics enormous amount of content hours and hours of gameplay without bordom even more fun with friends plus now i can say im a ninja
recommended
at first i downloaded this game because katanas in spess and i thought i would just bust some money on it so i go to the free2play store to buy the katana named nikana in game but to my great sadness the nikana is xp locked thats a nice free to play doesnt just allow you to buy all the good stuff i ended up saving the majority money and got some samurai shoulder pads and the ash ninja frame lazor shurikens great free2play great gameplay great coop great balancing i heart it
recommended
amazing game and you cant beat the fact that its free to play
recommended
this is far too much fun best 3rd person shooted ive ever played and it still in beta

absolutely an amazing free to play game have over 200 hours into it alone and its always evolving while there can be a good amount of downtime between updates every once in a while the amount of weapons warframesguys you play as things to collect dojo to build or clans to join and friendly community theres no reason not to play ive only once put about twenty bucks into this game for some early warframe slots and weapon slots since then ive made all i ever needed by selling items ingame great market just gotta keep up with prices

best free to play out right now you can pay to win or bulid the things to get better guns and warframes

warframe is hands down one of the best free games on steam this game has amazing graphics and is great with a controller you can just spend hours and hours on it the only downside is many items in game you have to buy with real money which isnt that bad since it is a free game over all i would recommend this game and if you have some extra cash lying around i would recommend you put it into warframe

the year is 2005 the gaming world is awaiting the dawn of a new era the xbox 360 and playstation 3 have been announced a well known developer digital extremes best known for its collaboration with epic games on unreal tournament has just taken the stage at e3 to show off its new concept dark sector for months and months it is the talk of the town it was the first real  next gen  footage httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvu3jw2xkqja shown before next gen was even a thing unfortunately the project known as dark sector took a very drastic and unwanted turn as lead creative designer steve sinclair told me last year at pax east  there was this thing called call of something duty  chuckeles  and everyone wanted world war ii games and so our scifi dark sector idea got shelved which caused allot of pent up frustration however as time passed and wwii games became less popular and with the emergence of this thing called  free to play  steve and company thought this would be a good time to really focus on their original idea expanding on the original concept warframe was born you are an ninja tenno to be exact fused with this ancient armor known as a warframe the lotus a being responsible for waking you from your cyro based slumber awakens you with the task of waking up fellow tenno in a on ongoing war against the grineer a savage race whos soul purpose is to conquer and enslave anything in their way including the tenno warframe is a pve game with some pvp elements which take place in what are called conclaves again steve talked about why they went in this direction  we were looking around and there were just so many pvp hard core death match games that we decided we wanted to take warframe in a different direction and make it coop you team up with other fellow tenno to take down waves of grineer corpus and the havok causing infestation among the constellation there are tons of planets to fight in and objectives to do to be fair at the writing of this review there is allot of  washrinserepeat because the game is still in beta however from the time i spent with steve and rebecca  community manager  at pax to the most recent update 11 patch this game has gone through huge changes and improvements the story is slowly but surely being developed and the abilities that you can attach to your warframe called mods have been tweaked and improved the game plays much like steve said  borderlands meets mass effect there is also a foundry where you can use blueprints to make new warframes weapons and item components you can even have you own clan with a dojo that you can decorate train in and build weapons items and blueprints at a discount price in all warframe is an amazing game from some truly amazing developers this is not just another game thrown out there to be a  farmville cash cow but a well thought out scifi shooter with a deep honor system and a great community of players from all over the world most of the conversation with steve was fun and light hearted but when i i asked him this question it became a little more serious  if that is possible for stevehehe i asked him where he saw warframe 5 years from now he said  wow 5 years i cant think past this month and this upcoming update i can say this though the whole team is very dedicated to this game it is our baby it is not just another game it is very personal i personally have clocked in well over 120 hours and can tell you that it is the f2p game of the year httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvihdxuqqxa9q&featurec4overview&listuusonhuuu663e_gsgb3iazbw so hopefully i have awakened you from your sleep tenno and hope to see you on the battlefield we need you score  810

its a very fun game indeed you just want to level up kill and get better guns and characters some may say its pay to win which isnt true since you dont have to buy the items to get them like some other games in the genre you can build your new weapons and more using credits and components recieved from missions which keeps the game interesting even after you have gone through all the planets also unlike some other dev teams de updates it frequently fixing bugs and actually doing things to keep their players happy and satisfied
recommended
awesome coop
recommended
an excellent first person shotter its biggest problem are the early game grind and the late game grind as long as you have the patient you can have all the weapons in the game without paying a cent
recommended
a nice 3rd person coop shooter has interesting mechanics and classes every class and weapon can be acquired by simply playing definitely recommend giving it a try only thing you might want to spend platinum purchasable currency is catalysts they are basically mandatory for higher level play and arent normally obtainable but as of now alerts and event which reward catalysts and catalyst blueprints are plentiful i have 20 blueprints from last greneer vs corpus event and will priobably be enough for most people
recommended
one of the best games ever great community awesome dev team
recommended
1010 would bang

the best free to play game in the history of all free to play games and video games in general yea even better than tf2 suck on that
recommended
best graphics ever in a freetoplay game great weapons and gameplay strongly recommended
recommended
such fun very review wow
recommended
i hope you like grinding youll be grinding alot did i mention grinding if you love grinding try playing tony hawk games with infinite balance but then again grinding in this game is more prominent even paying requires you to grind cant get powerful sniper until lv 3 mastery everything costs either a million credits or a rather unsatisfactory amount of premium currency other than that and sometimes clunky controls making your tenno flail around on walls and the lack of 1st person option its a very nice f2p game
recommended
possibly one of the greatest games i have ever played this is also the only game on steam which i have over 200 hours of game time warframe plays great and feels rewarding this game is a legend and deserves the respect and support that it has if you like being the ultamite space death machine play this game

recommended
this game is very hard to get good weapons but that pushes you to play with your friends also once you get a new warframe or weapon you have this great feeling of winning or knowing you did something play this if you and your friends are bored also jaret ing rhino stomped the  out of everyone

addictive stressrelieving and only occasionally frustrating updates occur regularly and the developers seem to listen to the community new content and bugfixes are released frequently and ninjas play free some content can only be purchased with platinum but platinum can now be obtained via trading with other players so the possiblities are limitless it is based on dark sector and the warrameweilders are the spiritual descendants of hayden tenno the protagonist of dark sector if the idea of being a futuristic semirobotic space ninja led by a mysterious canadian female of possible artificially intelligent origins is appealing to you get ready tenno

ive played this game when it was in early beta at that time warframe wasnt really something thats as awesome as it is now limited tilesets limited enemies repetitive missions and unpolished mechanics here and there even i myself have stopped once in a while usually spanning 45 months only to return because a friend was playing and almost each time i return new things are added in and this currently is my 3rd replay of the game and i have to say that although warframe isnt a totally perfect game there are flaws bugs glitches and connection issues running around wild but the digital extremes team has evolved the game to a point where it has become a much more complicated game than what it was a year ago yet they are still polishing things making new overhauls to certain aspects of the game and coming out with new stuffs to greet players old and new what i love about warframe is pretty much that almost everything that can be bought using money can be obtained normally through farming as well all that the free players loses are cosmetic items that does not affect gameplay other than the owners satisfaction and pride one of the new updates since ive stopped also included into it a new trading system which allows players to trade certain items for the platinums and other stuffs which even boasts the games value for me warframe is simply the no1 f2p game that i have ever played and i find myself amazed over and over every time i go back to it kudos to digital extremes this is a must play for any gamers interested in some scifi shooter action
recommended
shooting stuff slicing stuff being ninja n stuff if you like to do things like these this is a game for you become an awesome individual who uses special abilities customized weapons to achieve victory in a variety of game modes gather resources and frame  weapon components to unlock further more gaming potential warning grind fest if you dont really like working quite hard towards what you want theres always the pay option but everything except the cosmetics can be aquired through f2p gameplay so take a look you might put it down and look around instead but youll never know what will hook you in

pretty damn cool and free to play what more could you want in a game
recommended
best free to play game its a great game to play if you are looking to play cooperatifly without much pvp its free to play aspect is awesome with little to no exclusive pay only items not a pay to win game
recommended
an absurdly good game although i have barely played it as of now although teamwork is not nessicary it is probably the best part of this game and what makes it so fun
recommended
this game is a very fun game and the game has all kinds of weapons
recommended
a lot of fun especially if you can play with other people
recommended
this is one of my favorite games the graphics are spectacular the game quality is superb and the x factors of all the weapons and ai are awesome and very detailed and thorough the game its self is outstanding and the campaign and multi player are awesome some of it is confusing but really easy to catch on and learn once you have a grasp of it its one of the best games ever i would suggest this to everyone and when you play it the game has so much content that you wqant to spend money on the game to get it fast but if you dont want to you can get everything for free but it takes longer and its very difficult to find the items you need 1010 two thumbs up 5 stars whatever other rating system there is all the way up i like it a lot and it is one of my favorite games but that being said thats my opinion you should get it and find out for your self trust me youll wont regret it

space ninjas boiiiiiii i have started warframe the day after it was released the game was in its first update update 7 after closed beta the game looked so awful after a year and some magic this game looks great sure some mechanics are funky there is a vast amount of bugsexploitsglitches but just give the game some hope its 50 grinding and 50 gameplay after a few months or so the game may get boring but de digital extremes is working on and adding more content every once and a while its quite frequently nowadays the community is a great one you might encounter some pretty rude people but overall the players are kind and are willing to help everyone just visit the official warframe forums website and look around or so httpsforumswarframecom

my favorite free to play controls are awesome graphics are great gameplay is fantastic its like a combination between gears of war and ninja gaiden games that form a big part of my gaming childhood i know playing gow at 9 years old isnt the way to go theres many levels to play and they all progressively require a higher level out of you so you might have to replay many missions again however the game has a small twist every area of a mission generates differently its still the same objective but the area or asset itself is never the same one time youll play this way the next this other way this gives it a big bonus so youll feel like youre playing a whole new mission as opposed to playing the same repetetive gameplay which leads me to my next point the gameplay might get repetitive at times but i have lots of fun with this game hacking and slashing with a sword and gunning someone to pieces gives me a very good feeling only in games of course i really have fun in this game theres no doubt its my favorite free to play as you progress through a level you might get some mods these can be for your warframe or your weapons you can combine mods to make a bigger tier of that one or leave it like that using mods is a great way to level up and enhance your warframes skills to your liking maybe youre more of a shotgun fan theres a mod for that a very very very well made f2p if this ever becomes a paid game theres no doubt it will be heard about around town i highly recommend it and its free so you dont lose anything d

ok i really like the game its fun to play and it feels really epic the powers and all are nicely balanced and the gameplay is epic i dont really understand why this is free to play because this game is to cool for school

i entered the world of warframe with a lot of confusion the menu was full of options and customizations for me to choose from and i honestly had some trouble figuing out where to start eventually i got a few missions under my belt and found the color customization screen and from that moment on i was hooked this game is repetitive and grindy but if you let yourself get sucked in you will find yourself playing countless hours on it the one gripe i had is that it seems to lack an overall objevive however it really hit home for me after my fourth mission that this really is all about the spectacle and enjoying it you beat missions to acquire better weapons and power ups only to use them to repeat the process but when you eventually find yourself flying sideways down a hallway scoring headshots with a weapon you have built and colored yourself while impaling other enemies on an equally personalize sword you have no choice but to stop for a second and say yes this is why i enjoy playing this game

ninjas shooting aliens and robots with tech and  1110 proper review pardon my english  this game is fully free to play with slow and steady pace towards full geared with many different ninjas that you could get for free by grinding bosses mostly content for premium users is costumes and  but wait you could half of those by some random event ingame and premium users items is just for a quick good game therefore i conclude this game is fully free to play by an exception you couldnt get all of those cool looking ninjas and weapons in your inventory because you could only add slots with microtransaction the community is great i think dev is supportive too i got a quick responses for wanting to change my email id so i have been enjoyed for about 300 hours of fun smacking the enemies with so many interesting abilities the missions could be repetitive and boring but random generated map negates it a bit therefore anyone who enjoyed tpsgames should give this a try nothing to lose

a fun coop shooter that doesnt feel like its solely out to gouge its players wallets solid third person shooter mechanics and some fun swashbuckling coop works well with four invested players and an interesting upgrade system play with your friends to enjoy the game to the max cuz theres no fun playing this game on your own i would give it 910 because its really enjoyable when you play with friends

very fun with friends still fun with random people

i really enjoy this game graphicly its way above your average f2p also paying real money for things doesnt mean much since you dont typically fight each other this is a coop based game there is an option that you can duel with others but it has to be an accept action no one will just jump out of nowhere an kill you midmission there is a little bit of a learning curve getting used to the controls and an even greater one for a controller in my opinion when bad guys drop stuff everyone shares the loot you only see the stuff on your screen but everyone gets the same thing this game has kind of an mmo feel with some of the grinding involved but its done in an entertaining way as far as using your real money equivilant platinum you start with i recommend buying an extra slot for a suit and slots for weapons they are contantly updating this game which makes it continually enjoyable the improvements that are done for updates can sometimes change the whole dynamics of how you play your character fortunately enough i havent seen an update yet that has frustrated me into not playing anymore but instead curious about how to utilize the new system
recommended
this game is very underrated it deserves a higher meta score than it has a lot of the negative reviews were back when the game was much older and offered less they dont represent the game now excellent coop mostly bugfree smooth controls outstanding graphics tons of weapons upgrades and customization get pretty much anything you can buy with the store credit in game also except warframe and weapon slots i think oh and replayablity i have been playing this game for a long time they are always adding new modes that refresh the expereince i cant recommend it enough 8510

oh my god i started playing this game in the update 11 we are in the 14 now so many things have changed and for beter the original warframe game early version or vannila is nothing compared to what it is now hope the keep improving i cannot not reccomend it ps start playing this game now
recommended
a fantastic unique game wish it was a little cheaper on the cash shop but there really isnt anything wrong with this game

what do you play when you have played every game in your library and are bored with replaying them over and over again play warframe this game at first will look like just another great looking game with bad gameplay but it isnt the great thing about warframe is that 1 it is still in early access so you get updates which adds new things to the game 2 it has great graphics and gameplay 3 you never get bored replaying a mission and 4 you get to play as fing high tech ninjas for a free to play game warframe has the feel of a game that youd normally have to pay $60 for i hope you like this review and find it helpful now if you exuse me i have an assassination mission to complete

wow ive just only started this game and i must say its the best free to play fps i have ever played in my life 1110

warframe is simply put a great game its continuously updating with new content and that combined with its relaxed yet exciting gameplay will keep you playing for a long time i personally love every aspect of warframe but there are two things that put me off and i felt i should make people aware of it for one the game can get a bit repetitive more specifically the grinding part although it does not do so to the point that it makes the game ridiculous andor not fun it still remains a bit of an issue second is the presence of the ingame trading more specifically the ability to trade things for the ingame currency platinum which you usually buy with real life money this function and how extensively it is being used might as well change the name of warframe to wartrade however other than those two things i find this an awesome game and i definitely reccommend it to other people its graphics are definitely appealing the customer service has been really good and its gameplay is very addictive at least to me not to mention warframe is essentially completely freetoplay you can unlock and play all content by just playing the game using money in this game only unlocks purely cosmetic stuff and allows you to get gear and weapons slightly faster you get 50 free platinum when creating an account to boot which i heavily suggest you spend for warframeweapon slots

awesome graphics good team play and massive customization

warframe is one of the best coop games that you could play with your buddies you are a badass ninja that can parkour everywhere and you get to kill all these random enemies    
recommended
i generally dont like shooters and oftentimes this type of game gives me motion sickness however im having a lot of fun with this game and it doesnt make me feel ill also its third person rather than first person so that helps there are quite a few classes to choose from though you do have to hunt down your parts to make them but thats half the fun pretty much anything in the cash shop you could just as well hunt for it cash shop is more of a convenience and not really necessary except to unlock slots if you want more warframes
recommended
really fun game though it is slightly p2w players who dont pay can still get really far thoug as all items you can buy you can also obtain in game generally
recommended
a fun way to spend time with friends

warframe is a free to play fastpaced third person shooter that can be best described as space ninjas developed by digital extremes warframe follows the adventures of the tenno during a war with the grineer a race of militarized humanoid clones tenno soldiers bear a warframe  effectively a futuristic and alien combat suit  into battle as well as a primary weapon a sidearm and a melee weapon the game is essentially a sequel to dark sector taking place about a thousand years after its events its a game built on two very solid features exciting gameplay and awesome gear at its heart warframe is all about the action combat is intense and blazingly fast the tenno can sprint slide and dodge out of hairy situations as well as being able to run along walls and displaying quite a fair collection of parkour motions players can sneak around a map and melee an enemy from behind for elevated damage but its nowhere near as fun or as easy as running into a crowded room guns a blazing theres a much heavier focus on staying agile in a gunfight rather than being sneaky each warframe has its own set of unique abilities and stats giving each one a diverse feel from the other a wide array of weapon types keeps the combat fresh and gives the player a multitude of ways to play guns feel impactful but melee weapons tend to feel a bit floaty with an astounding amount of different enemy types and bosses levels can produce a variety of challenges theres even a oneonone pvp feature in which players can duke it out these are called conclaves and are limited by a point scale to keep players of relatively equal skill fighting against each other while it is nice to see a human player react with unpredictability a lot of the ai in the game is very predictable in its actions theyre still difficult but it takes away from any sort of surprise if youve already squared off against that enemy before also it is highly recommended that you play this game with friends and a common goal in mind it can get stale quickly without those two things despite that theres still an immense amount of fun to be had in warframes fastpaced shooter action warframe is visually stunning and i dont mean just for a free to play game this game is gorgeous for any type of game theres a great attention to detail lighting effects are cinematic environments are vibrant with color however youll see many of the same settings over and over again while they are pretty to look at seeing what seems to be the same map several missions in a row gets very tiring the slight blur that is created from constant movement will distract from any minor visual flaws  flaws that youll have a hard time finding to begin with this is actually one of the few games in which ive fired my weapon solely for the purpose of hearing how it sounds the guns sound incredibly real and impactful and even though each gun has its own distinct sound most of them manage to sound pretty good it certainly outdoes the gun sounds that are apparent in more successful shooters like call of duty warframe is just full to the brim with varying types of gear warframes essentially character types are plentiful and number well into the double digits each player has three weapons a primary a sidearm and a melee weapon there are a multitude of primary weapons such as rifles shotguns bows and snipers sidearms include full auto and semiauto pistols available melee weapons are swords staves axes and more these weapons can be bought with platinum  the equivalent of real world money  but are also easily obtainable through the ingame currency known as credits weapons must be built by first purchasing their blueprints and then having the items required to build it items are scattered as drops throughout the planets and while theyre entirely useless on their own they can be used in unison to create some really interesting weapons however items have build times weapons generally take twelve or twentyfour hours while warframes take a lengthy seventytwo this can be a bit bothersome to those without patience but items can be rushed to completion by spending a certain amount of platinum this gear can also be modded with a plethora of upgrades depending on how the player see fits resulting in a huge amount of customization a single weapon can be made to play several different ways depending on the mods the player has installed on it this creates an experience that truly is different for every player and item while most free to play games suffer in terms of story and narrative warframe actually does a very successful job at this well partially its narrative is weak and lacks integration into the gameplay the average player will just plow through the missions without even realizing theres a plot going on most of the plot will be found in the codex a menu in which players can read up on the lore it takes a while to uncover and quite honestly ive only scratched the surface but its chockfull of sciencefiction goodness there are questions of morality and the tennos purpose in the universe there are references to dark sector proving that the two games exist within the same universe its certainly very interesting and easily dominates in a market where story tends to be an afterthought another strong point one where it stands above its competitors in the free to play market is the incredibly fair balancing of real world and ingame currencies almost anything that can be obtained through the cash shop can be found as loot or created via a blueprint most of the items that cant be obtained without spending some cash are purely cosmetic such as color palettes and weapon skins however in a game that is so gearcentric its a shame to see so few free inventory slots given to the players even still prices are pretty reasonable shelling out cash doesnt put players too much ahead of others and the small gaps that do exist can easily be closed by player ability its nice to see a free to play game that doesnt put a huge chasm between its paying and nonpaying players and that certainly is a huge advantage for warframe in its market one of the biggest drawbacks of warframe is its perpetual state of open beta things can change from patch to patch whether they be minor updates or huge ones that drastically overhaul something like the ui this results in a large amount of bugs theyre not common and prevalent in every mission but youre bound to run into them fortunately they tend to stray far from gamebreaking and are usually just minor annoyances overall warframe is a great addition to any collection as it is able to balance fantastic gameplay gorgeous visuals impactful sounds an interesting story stellar optimization and a fair currency system and its free did i mention its free i would like to see more integration of its impressive lore into the gameplay as well as more free inventory slots but apart from those setbacks it is a great game that should be given a try by anyone who enjoys some fastpaced action and the reload wheel as of update 12 is pretty awesome

warframewhere to start first of all this is the only game ive spent more than 700 hours on in all of my 20 or so steam games there are many reasons for this and i shall describe all the pros and cons of this game in this text pros this is the only true free to play ive seen in my life everything in the game weapons characters cosmetics etc is avaiable to f2p players but requires some grind to compensate cosmetics colors shoulder pads chest pieces capes etc can only be aquired with platinums the currency you have to buy with real money but guess what you can get platinums for free by trading stuff with other players you dont have to pay a single cent to play this game and get everything if you have a bit of time to invest in it the coop experience is present and intense a great game to play with friends the graphics are good and will run smoothly on any decent computer and if you dont have a such computer well you can lower the graphics and you probably wont even see the difference exept for the fps boost the game is updated very frequently and gets a huge update every 3 months or so digital extreme is very commited in making warframe the best f2p shooter out there very developped movement system you can run on walls and do some epic tricks you can roll while airborne you can slide on the ground and so much moreyou are a space ninja many warframes to choose from all warframes are different and each one has some cool and unique superpowers and rolesplaystyles one is a slow tank with crowd control another can place shields that block bullets and my favorite one zephyr can even fly random encounters sometimes you will get messaged by special mini bosses that will try to assasinate you in a near future when you are in a mission rumors say they drop epic loot on death and are particularly deadly cons as you progress further in the game lower level missions tend to get way too easy but they are still enjoyable the opposite is also true a low level player trying to take on a level 30 mission will get wrecked at current times the late game content is somewhat poor as the only thing left for vets to do is progress through mastery ranks and max out all their gear but again the frequent updates keeps the veterans playing as more and more content is added i also heard rumors about some lenses of power that will add some serious late game content for all the accomplished players upon their release enemies are a bit stupid their ai needs more polishing but that is far from making this game boring  in conclusion this game is a model for all the f2p out there it stands on the top of shooter games list and its definitely the best f2p steam can offer you by retro050

its ok now seriously the game is only good if you can deal with a bunch of farming and grinding as it mostly focuses on leveling up your equipment and aquiring new gear most warframes and weapons are really easy to obtain while others require you to do special missions which are time consuming and require dozens of runs to obtain what you need thats pretty much what youll be doing most of the time currently the game lacks endgame content so when you max out your favourite weapons and warframes the only thing to do is farm stuff that you dont really care about theres also a glaring lack of story to the universe the developers give us larger storyish based events every once in a while but all we learn from those is whats currently happening in the games universe the origins of both your enemies and warframes is completely unknown speaking of devs digital extremes devs of warframe communicate with their players very well theres livestreams every week where they talk about upcoming changes to the game and such as for the gameplay itself its quite good theres new mechanics introduced every few months the game runs smoothly gameplay is really enjoyable and diverseyoull still be farming but you have a wide variety of equipment to use when farming the game is really enjoyable with friends clan mates ect another thing to notice is the lack of dedicated servers so if you have a  connection  tough luck tldr like farming and grinding this game is for you have friends and wanna play something together right here enjoy immersive storylines look elsewhere like coop bingo like going solo well you can but its really boring and repetitive that way
recommended
well well well a few months back a wrote a reivew about this awesome game it was a perfect combination of gameplay and customization now several updates later it has improved and grew heh i didnt know it was possible to be better than perfect warframe is the best game of 2013 for me i started out as the only person to play warframe and i now influenced over 10 now dedicated players sounds small but thats like half of my friends list 3 the game has complete character and weapon customization every warframe suits different types of gameplay and its up to you which one that is you can find whatever weapons please you and upgrade those weapons uniquely through mods even the color schemes can be altered to your cup of tea and nothing in this game is buytowin everything can be crafted and built for an equal gameplay for everyone warframe has randomly generated maps for every mission for replayability no two missions are the same and this game is designed for coop not pvp so its a game to make friends not eniemies and digital extremes is constantly having ingame events and new items for a better game and lastely the graphics are amazing i personally have a great computer and its like seeing a work of art just for the loading screens this game is beautiful and you arent restricted to the graphics so you can numb it down if needed to remove lag warframe is amazing i dont know why you havent downloaded it yet its free

its an amazing game graphically animation gameplay design all amazing a little grindy yes i admit that but its insanely good for free to play that being said dont go into this expecting to reach end game within a week metacritic is on drugs or something its heaps better then 66100

came into this game pretty blind to what it was about only been playing it for a few days now and its by far one of the best games ive played in a while fast pace and action packed i would recommend this to anyone looking for a good way to spend some time very nice community and comfortable game play 1110

ive been trying to compose a review that truly shows all the experience i gathered while playing warframe for so long and it is still hard to put in words i am a player that is filled with joy when a f2p game launches or is available as an open beta i enjoy gaming i really do f2p is an attribute linked with many positive and many more negative aspects in my humble opninion warframes f2p aspect with real money currency and what you spend it on is probably the most balanced in all of f2p history eventhough the prices are pretty steep this review will mostly cover the f2p or p2w aspect i am too lazy to write a review for the gameplay part which is fine and steadily evolving to be better than before lets get the important things out of the way first shall we pay to win p2w warframe is a coop game at its core nobody loses when a teammate is stronger but not fun breaking stronger what makes him stronger a weapon or a warframe character that has yet to be build by you or your clan  can you build it or are you restricted as a f2p gamer to never play with such glory yourself no all it takes is time and resources  so i grind to be able to grind more it is not an prehistoric asia mmorpg where you spent weeks in the same spot to kill the same enemies just to upgrade your wood dagger to a copper one resource drops have been raised and are at the moment laughable high no shortcomings whatsoever  then why should i spend platinum real money ingame currency in the first place if you are a lazy bum with a lot of money but nearly to no time to play you can buy warframes weapons and various random mods used to upgrade warframes and weapons etc directly from the store to support digital extremes in their efforts to please the community there are even a ton of cosmetics to make your warframe and weapon look like you want it to look like _ wha have you spent money on this piece of carp no i have not and i doubt i ever will i am a real money pincher and i like to test out the limits of every f2p game out there till i see either a huge paywall that blockades content or whatnot or a f2p turns out to be a real pay to win fest where gamers who do not wish to spend money on it are getting their gamer souls squeezed out  can you acquire platinum in another way except spending real money yes you certainly can and i encourage all of you to do so there is an economic system in warframe you can trade anything of value and anything tradeable there are some restrictions for every player be it mods parts for weapons and warframes prime variants of weapons and warframes only or other stuff open to trade i obtained my platinum by trading mods with a fellow player now i have enough platinum to spend it on the real essential stuff i would only spend it on  what did you spend it on in theory you have acess to every weapon and warframe in the game problem is you do not have enough space to fit all of them in your arsenal thats why you have to unlock additional slots for your inventory 20 platinum for 1 warframe slot  12 platinum for 2 weapon slots used to be 20 platinum for 1 weapon slot if i remember correctly but they changed it for the greater good  but what about platinum exclusive purchases they exist but are mostly cosmetics and booster xp credits or resources nothing you will feel left out of cosmetics are fine so are boosters in this case there is no gambling aspect where you can burn away 100$ worth of platinum and get nothing in return the sanity level of the devs is too damn high to allow such things tldr  warframe features an exemplary use of microtransactions in the f2p genre no shortcomings for gamers who do not pay  platinum is obtainable through trading ie not spending real money in fact you even get 50 platinum for free as a new player  the essential purchases are indeed the most affordable warframe and weapon slots 20p for 1  12p for 2  you are not hard pressed to spend money or get a constant reminder that you should such marketing harassment does not occur in warframe  as the engines name suggests  this game is evolving and you can expect a major update every month update 14 being the latest and hotfixes like crazy i do not know what else to say im getting tired i just hope some of my thoughts are reaching your ears properly and have answered some important questions if not feel free to ask in the comment section and i or someone else will answer them best regards

love this game it looks gorgeous if you have a decent pc otherwise you can play it on a ps4 it has its flaws with the amount of grinding you will have to do and is missing a proper endgame however the way the parkour is done the way the weapons handle the gameplay melts away the tediousness of the grind i would say that overall this game is a great game
recommended
ive been following this game for a while since it was in early stages of closed beta and i can tell you this it is constantly being updated with awesome new content and fun events the community is one of the better ones i have seen in any online game the crafting system is done well the only thing you cant get without spending some cash is cosmetics additional color pallets and scarfs etc of course there are bad sides to the game too first the game seams bugged alot but the developers are working hard on fixing those issues and the changes in the past few updates have improved the overall performance of the game the game doesnt focus on pvp so its almost nonpresent which isnt necessarily a bad thing just dont log in expecting some grand pvp actionit is a coop focused game  the missions can get a bit repetative well those are the barebone traits of the game i loved it it has a huge community so why dont you come and join us 
recommended
i absolutely love this game the movements nice the grinding isnt as awful as other free to play games ive played and the customizing on the weaponscharacters is fun theres also hidden areas in some of the levels and i love things like that i personally recommend playing it with friends if you can
recommended
one of the most addicting and beautiful freetoplay games out there i highly recomend it its kind of like a tpsmmo because of the powers you get on each warframe the wepons are ok some of them are terriblebut on the bright side you can get great a huge longsword galatine and bladed boomarang glave sadly you can only get a glave by using platinum real life money and login rewardsso all in all i totaly recomended it

cooperative cyborg space ninja third person action rpg do i have your attention yet having witnessed the evolution of this game from its infancy i can say that it has grown into a unique peice of gaming that will certainly garner its place in the hearts and minds of people coming from just a handful of warframes this games version of character with premade stats to an abundence such that there is almost always one to suit any playstyle within the third person market in terms of graphics it has come a long way the lighting and animations have come to a crisp smoothness that a lot of other freetoplay titles simply havent gotten to the biometal or whatever the suits are made up of look organic but have the deflecting power of metal which makes for an interesting change when youre sliding across a metal surface and hear the suit grinding against the ground combat is almost always fast and fluid with hoards of enemies attempting to do everything in their power from keeping you from your objective with varying enemy types going head long into a wave of enemies can be fun but the unprepared should be ready for a quick death finding your niche is easier since there are plenty of people in the community who are willing to pull you along to get the warframe of your choice by getting you the parts to build it crafting is simple to learn and essencial to maximizing your arsenal as well getting the right gun could just be a matter of getting the materials to build it if it turns out to not be that great sell it off and craft again until you find that one youre willing to put money down to get a orokin catalyst and enhance it further for a fraction of the cost it would have been to purchase the weapon outright who knows you might even find an event and get the catalyst completely free the final and most important element of the game is the mods these can completely alter the way some of the warframes play out even some of the weapons get an extra kick current personal favorite is the kunai throwing knives with a 170% chance of an additional shot at the same time thats right i get the possibility to throw a third with each toss of a blade and deal massive damage finding this kind of combo for your weapon is just a download away enjoy

this game has some amazing graphics for a freetoplay game mechanics are nice too although its an open beta there is very little content in the game though and its definitely not worth spending any irl money on and after a while there isnt much to this game that brings you back to it the missions despite the levels being somewhat randomly generated every time you play a mission get extremely repetitive after a while 710

super sweet 3rdperson shooter controls and systems take time to get used to the damage system has got a big learning curve but once you do get it youre basically a god almost everything ingame you can build but there are some things that are exclusively pay to get plus they give you some ingame premium cash when you start up so all good its dirt cheap if you want to buy some more online interactions are pretty ok you get a squad most of the time but you never truly stick with them cause of connection issues without a good internet connections your ethier lagging from your connection or someonelses note you actually need to join a clan to do crap in this game 00 probably cause some weapons are exclusive to clans the gameplay gets repetitve after a while due to the tidous farming and the same mission types over and over again though there are a few random events that keep it fresh the shooting mechanics arewell generic shooting mechanincs nothing really special unless of course you count the warframe abilites overall score with its fun and social gameplay and a few minor bugs and problems i give warframe a 910
recommended
very fun online coop very difficult for singleplayer its alot more fun when youre playing with friends as opposed to strangers though conceptwisestorywise its pretty unique and fascinating as alot of the backstory is left for the player to interpret gameplay wise its a very cool third person shooter and thirdperson melee experience with special abilities for each individual warframe although it uses microtransactions these are nonessential and more or less just allow easierfaster access to items you could get through gameplay otherwise ive been playing since closed beta and ive watched the game grow and change but have yet to see a change i cannot stand they seem to update frequently and patch as needed and have yet to come up with a solid reason to be disappointed by the game or anything in it

warframe changed the way i thought of [free to play games] well sort of having friends who play together using team speak is really fun & funny have to buy blueprint to build your items might take up to days but its worth it unless you wanted to use real money on getting the items fast while supporting the dev to update the game and keep it going well give it a try and play to free up some stress from the real world add me up if you need a friend on steam sfhappy

i whole heartedly reccomend playing this game with friends mainly because this game consists of massive amounts of grinding to get anything done seriously this game is an endless grind buts its actually pretty damn fun if you enjoy over the top space ninja action i give it a 6510

time consuming and addictive game although its pay to win for some players its still fun to play and kill your boredom

great game

hundreds of action packed four player coop missions without having to spend a penny generated stages with 10 different mission types all of which play very differently from one another character upgrading and weapon crafting is done through drops during levels which is nowhere near as grindy as people make it out to be there is a big character and weapon roster allowing play styles of every kind as long as they include a good bit of mindless shooting updates are plenty well optimised while still looking good and the warframes just look too cool to turn down

this game is so awesome it gave me implosive

after 100 hours on this game i think im more than capable of writing a review first of all this game is the best play to win model in free to play titles out there you need not spend a cent to get anything you just need to play and get stuff ingame to build things ingame using ingame credits thats it secondly this is an awesome game youll never get bored here its rewarding and fun and you dont have to play alone at all there will always be three random people out there who will join you in a game or you can invite your friends the missions are fun and you can specialize your weapons for different types of enemy factions it is rewarding when you send an arrow flying straight towards an enemy and the arrow impales it to the wall or decapitates it whats more you can play as a trigger happy freak or a careful and silent ninja your choice thirdly if your pocket is itching and you are not one of those patient types then you can spend money to get platinum the premium currency and buy new frames or weapons although since that would defeat the purpose of play to win id recommend buying platinum for $5 or $10 and using it to buy weapon slots or warframe slots that way when you make more weapons or warframes in game youll never run out of space fourthly the login rewards now this is realy interesting you can get the following type of rewards credits ingame currency weapon xp primarysecondarymelee warframe xp warframe blueprints rare materials for crafting discounts on platinum yes you read that last one right discounts and they are heavy ranging from 50% to 90% unbelievable eh makes it so damn cheap to buy platinum fifthly you can create your own playstyle stealth or trigger happiness everything is yours there are plenty of mods available in the game to get your hands on and you can mold your weapon to your will if you are not satisfied with the weapon you crafted sell it sell it and get some credits sixthly there are various alert missions and operations going on every single day in warframe alert mssions give out credits and some rare materials or blueprints you can use them or sell them the blueprints not the rare materials theyre needed for crafting right and the operations give out rare materials and credits too operations can be infestation outbreaks or invasions they give out credits ranging for 10k to 35k still not drooling well ill only say two words space ninjas now if that hasnt watered your mouth then i dont know what will scroll up and get it now you are wasting valuable time
recommended
i love this gamei its amazing thx developers for great game
recommended
love this game it looks gorgeous if you have a decent pc otherwise you can play it on a ps4 it has its flaws with the amount of grinding you will have to do and is missing a proper endgame however the way the parkour is done the way the weapons handle the gameplay melts away the tediousness of the grind i would say that overall this game is a great game
recommended
ive been following this game for a while since it was in early stages of closed beta and i can tell you this it is constantly being updated with awesome new content and fun events the community is one of the better ones i have seen in any online game the crafting system is done well the only thing you cant get without spending some cash is cosmetics additional color pallets and scarfs etc of course there are bad sides to the game too first the game seams bugged alot but the developers are working hard on fixing those issues and the changes in the past few updates have improved the overall performance of the game the game doesnt focus on pvp so its almost nonpresent which isnt necessarily a bad thing just dont log in expecting some grand pvp actionit is a coop focused game  the missions can get a bit repetative well those are the barebone traits of the game i loved it it has a huge community so why dont you come and join us 
recommended
i absolutely love this game the movements nice the grinding isnt as awful as other free to play games ive played and the customizing on the weaponscharacters is fun theres also hidden areas in some of the levels and i love things like that i personally recommend playing it with friends if you can
recommended
one of the most addicting and beautiful freetoplay games out there i highly recomend it its kind of like a tpsmmo because of the powers you get on each warframe the wepons are ok some of them are terriblebut on the bright side you can get great a huge longsword galatine and bladed boomarang glave sadly you can only get a glave by using platinum real life money and login rewardsso all in all i totaly recomended it

cooperative cyborg space ninja third person action rpg do i have your attention yet having witnessed the evolution of this game from its infancy i can say that it has grown into a unique peice of gaming that will certainly garner its place in the hearts and minds of people coming from just a handful of warframes this games version of character with premade stats to an abundence such that there is almost always one to suit any playstyle within the third person market in terms of graphics it has come a long way the lighting and animations have come to a crisp smoothness that a lot of other freetoplay titles simply havent gotten to the biometal or whatever the suits are made up of look organic but have the deflecting power of metal which makes for an interesting change when youre sliding across a metal surface and hear the suit grinding against the ground combat is almost always fast and fluid with hoards of enemies attempting to do everything in their power from keeping you from your objective with varying enemy types going head long into a wave of enemies can be fun but the unprepared should be ready for a quick death finding your niche is easier since there are plenty of people in the community who are willing to pull you along to get the warframe of your choice by getting you the parts to build it crafting is simple to learn and essencial to maximizing your arsenal as well getting the right gun could just be a matter of getting the materials to build it if it turns out to not be that great sell it off and craft again until you find that one youre willing to put money down to get a orokin catalyst and enhance it further for a fraction of the cost it would have been to purchase the weapon outright who knows you might even find an event and get the catalyst completely free the final and most important element of the game is the mods these can completely alter the way some of the warframes play out even some of the weapons get an extra kick current personal favorite is the kunai throwing knives with a 170% chance of an additional shot at the same time thats right i get the possibility to throw a third with each toss of a blade and deal massive damage finding this kind of combo for your weapon is just a download away enjoy
recommended
this game has some amazing graphics for a freetoplay game mechanics are nice too although its an open beta there is very little content in the game though and its definitely not worth spending any irl money on and after a while there isnt much to this game that brings you back to it the missions despite the levels being somewhat randomly generated every time you play a mission get extremely repetitive after a while 710

every time i come back to warframe its a little better i loved the look of the game from the first day keith thompsons art design shows and it is awesome but it was bugridden and sluggish i come back six months later and here is this immersive actionparkour gem packed with gorgeous particle effects and set in an interesting universe come back a month later and the interface is all cool now and they have customizable everythings the latest iteration is almost perfect i think we finally have a successor to team fortress 2 and it only took 6 years

fantastic parkour system melee combat gunplay and ability system impressive graphics and style can be a bit repetitive levelwise but has enough variety to keep things interesting and the gameplay itself is just so damn fun its nuts the mod system is also fantastic and makes for hours and hours of customization and upgrading this game recieves constant updates and slowly keeps getting better larger more varied and more polished if youre looking for an action packed thrill ride full of badassery and deep satisfying player progression and dont want to spend a penny try this game for sure

warframe is a game that you can either love or hate before you start playing it you need to at all times keep in mind that this is still a beta huge and growing but only a beta various bugs are a common sight but developers try to patch them all as well as they can and sometimes even release hotfixes on the run to fix the most annoying ones big packs of new content also come every now and then so the gameplay doesnt get too stale and players find something new to do all the time warframe is a tpp shooter taking place in a futuristic solar system mysterious race known as tenno are cleaning the planetary system from the influence of various factions and the player becomes one of these protectors there are many classes called warframes to choose between each with their own set of skills and statistics but the player gets to pick only one at the start and unlocking other ones might take some time as it required materials and credits although the game is very dynamic and it doesnt take much time to finish a mission or two the game is clearly targeted at players who want to stay for longer the large amount of weaponry and warframes means it will take a lot of playing to unlock and master in addition to that there are mods used for modifying both the weapons and classes resulting in countless combinations where every player can customize hisher equipment according to own taste and preferred gameplay the f2p system means of course that there is a virtual currency in this case platinum available for purchase for everyone willing to spend their hard earned money on the game it can buy weapons materials warframes some visual customization elements etc fortunately unlike many games of this sort it never feels like you absolutely need to buy something because you are too weak comparing others if you have enough time you can spend that instead of real money to acquire desired equipement except visual elements but they do not affect gameplay personally i recommend the game to everyone who likes scifi andor shooters and has a lot of time to spend on this game because it will not let go easily and it will suck you in for at least few dozens of hours for the rest you can always try it after all ninjas play for free
recommended
warframe isnt one of those runofthemill free2play games you often see nowadays yes there are microtransactions and yes there is bought currency however thats where the line is dropped warframe is a game revolving around 1 versus 3 fight with you the tenno against the grineer the corupus and the infested you and three other players in your squad must eliminate these enemies by completing missions and events that are present throughout the game you are given a vast amount of customizability with not only your loadout but your cosmetic appearance weapons are either bought using platnium microtransactions credits achieved through missions and building them using blueprints warframes also occur the same way but may require more work there are around about two hundred different missions ranging from about 1011 planets of our solar system in which each mission has a certain faction tilemap set and objective that is to be accomplished as you challenge this mission however missions with the same objective may seem almost identical which ill explain later frames otherwise known as your character holds completely unique abilities that will aid either you or your allies each frame also has a seperate set of statistics and can be used to suit the needs of the mission you can also enhance not only your weapons but your frames with mods or artifacts these artifacts are obtained through missions and building frames effects of these mods can range from addition armour to enhanced firing speed to poison or elemental damage frame mods can boost attributes such as speed or ability power warframe is completely different from most f2p games as they dont necessarily require you to spend money to get further in game most things can be aquired through playing and gaining levels somethings however that may affect you would be the fact that you cant get more than 23 frames at once unless you buy a frame slot or you cant surpass a certain amount of weapons before you need to buy weapon slots this is not necessarily worrisome in the beginning weeks but it will get to you once you get some more powerful weapons and youd rather not have to sell them in order to get a new weapon same with the frames which is probably the only problem with the microtransations present on this game but they still maintain a fairly reputable system which isnt hogged with this now this may not be early but the game is largely grindy in order to amass a decent chunk of money in order to build or buy youll need to do quite a bit of missions this is another bad downside to the game which can cause boredom once you get past a certain point where fighting and completing missions has become basically worthless also missions of the same gametype may seem extremely identical however the fact that the game is coop makes the game much more enjoyable along with the fact that teamwork is actually needed at times in order to successfully complete a misiion without error the graphics in the game are really well made possibly the best graphics ive seen for a f2p game not only this but the graphics are fairly scalable allowing lowerend computers to run it at the cost of lower graphic fidelity a couple mistakes that dont make much of a different is that the bloom can be massively impairing if you view it at a certain angle the physics engine is a bit derpy as well but it doesnt make any significant difference finally the community of this game is probably one of the better ones ive encountered most people are helpful relatively kind and because its not a competitive game in most aspects insults and such arent flung very often there are some who refuse to work and can be a massive nuisance with this i finally end this crappy review of a decent game personally i suggest you not take my word on this to heart and try the game for yourself now go tenno
recommended
warframe is a good game but it can feel like your doing the same thing over and over again the combat is fun the card system is nice and the guns and meele really make the game what it is graphics are good but if this isnt the game for you youll know right off the bat however its is really fun for players that like this genre
recommended
fun actionpacked game really nice graphics if you like ninjas in space and shooters this is the game for you fast paced game play dungeon crawler coop game with many weapons to choose from it could do with more strategy as most games with a full team of 4 wind up being a huge zerg and the final kill count seems to be related to the person who run the fastest game can get grindy and repetitive and the store items can be a little pricy but if you want to just have a blast and shoot anything in sight for a while this will get you hooked
recommended
this is an absolutley amazing game everytime i open it up i cant believe that im playing a free game if this game was priced at ten dollars i would still buy it awesome game

this game is awesome nuff said

its a great game along with coop you have get to have neat player abilities which if paired up with other warframes you and your friends can be devastating against your enemies its free the gameplay is fun and for a freetoplay its very pretty so spaceninjas need i say more 8510 85 because its takes so long to get new weapons and other warframes >< but hey all the more reason to shoot stuff right
recommended
great game ive logged loads and loads of hours on it for quite awhile you can solo it too but on most bosses and defence missions youll need a helping hand its a good blend of melee and shooter filling the enemy full of lead or tiny metal darts then hacking them to bit with your melee weapon of choice collecting and building new items can be a grind at a start but after a while it soon eases plus its free give it a try
recommended
since i last played this game in closed beta and left it due to it lagging on my computer along with choppy movement the amount of updates that the developers have put forth is amazing warframes premise for the game is unique and is continuously being built upon theres a learning curve to the game but once you learn it it is a lot more enjoyable also playing with friends and making new ones is always good d

this is a great game away from the normal things i play graphics are great only complaint is how there arent many differences in the maps all in all though its a awesome game to get with friends coop it up and kill stuff

warframe is a fun and exciting thirdperson shooter leveling your warframe and playing through its missions is super fun when you first start out although end game can be a bit grindy there is always something to do and work towards there is online mode as well as private so you can play by yourself or with other people but its definatelly more fun with friends if youre looking for an interesting action oriented game with some challange pick up warframe and give it a try

space ninjas in space with space guns thats basically what i say the game is to people that have no clue about it and i love this game sure it has its fault suich as f2p meaning nothing you still need to spend at least $20 on it eventually but other than that the devs are nice the community is good and its all in a ll fun to play the gamer itself is really neat even though its a beta its still a very decent game a lot of fun killing times granted its not very heavy on the lore but its still a good game its sort of like minecraft you dont understand it but you still get addicted to it at some point or another the weapons are cool and the fact that you put on a different suit and it gives you these awesome abilities makes it fun you can customize the play style to however you want it to be stealthy bum rush magic its all there so check it out it wont cost you anything to start but if you get into it a little investment to help out these awesome devs is totally worth it

warframe is a game which puts you in the shoes of a tenno aka a mother ing space ninja where your job is to kill a bunch of people who look kind of like the emporer from star wars or people with shoe boxes for heads the gameplay is pretty standard for a third person shooter but adds a few unique mechanics that makes the game flow together quite nicely and makes killing waves apon waves of crude clone nerd guys incredibly satisfying the game consists of you doing a bunch of missions that are kind of made obselete as the game is focused  very heavily  around obtaining parts for weapons and warframes this is a good thing and a bad thing because obtaining a new gun or a warframe can completely change the way the game is played but i wont go into that the reason why this is bad is that it makes the game very grindey and passively forces the player into committing to grinding for something to spice up the gameplay as the starter gear is poor and uninteresting  alternatively they can invest their hardearned coin into the game and just get most of the fun stuff through the micro transaction store this sort of forced commitment has lead to a lot of people i know disliking the game as they came in and joined to play with other people who were higher as they felt that the gear they started with was more underwhelming and it put them off the game a little although this isnt much of a review as more of just throwing some thoughts onto steam without using spellcheck i wanted to say something about the game as i have poured a lot of my time and money into it because the game is so satisfying and fresh when you invest your time into to it in the way i have id like to say to anyone that picks this up as a try for a free to play game that its a game where you may love it from the start but you may also have to invest you time or money in to get the same amount of enjoyment as others
recommended
this is a solid beta it provides great fast paced action expansive leveling and customization you can play solo or in groups so you arent strong armed into one or the other i will say it again though it is a beta so there are bugs but the flip side to that is a continual stream of updates i am taking place in the first big operation and it is a lot of fun basically it has everything i could want in an action shooter big levels different types of missions many environments lots of guns lots of leveling of gear etc just a great game for 20mins or 20hrs

four words space ninjas in space warframe is awesome the unique style and fast pace gameplay really make for a good time its f2p and you really do not need to put any money in to the game to enjoy it to the fullest you can buy the warframes and weapons but they are are easy enough to obtain given a little time

its ok not great but ok ive really tried to like this game but i just havent been able to get there yet and i find myself going back to mass effect 3 its a shame bioware has pretty much blown off its multiplayer support i really dislike the fact that you cant earn platinum by just playing the game instead youre either required to shell out money or need to grind for ridiculous lengths of time to unlock new stuff regardless for what its worth its pretty good especially considering its freetoplay if they were to change the purchasing systems and leveling system in the future id most likely donate cash toward its development addendum 20131213 its actually a lot of fun ive been playing the crap out of it the past couple of weeks and now that ive picked up on the resource farming and have a better idea on the forging i think its pretty entertaining i still like the overall feel of mass effect better but me has become pretty stagnant compared to the continuous evolution of warframe i will continue to dislike the purchasing system and the inability to get new equipment in an acceptable amount of time without paying for it i also find it appalling that de put in the option to pay platinum for credits allinall fun
recommended
this game is possibly the best game i have ever played mixing creativity building fighting magic abilities and all sorts of fun this game is just stunningly amazing i would recommend this game to absolutely everyone and would like to ask them to give it a chance considering it is free anyway overall worth the download and fun as hell definitely get it
recommended
i cant stop playing this game help me for a more substatnive review a lot has already been covered in other reviews that i can echo the gameplay is fun its got some grinding aspects but you never feel a lack of what to do the coop aspects are spectacular and abilities start to synergize with each other as you start to work together the reason i got so wholy sucked into it though is that it feels like an amalgamation of a lot of my favorite aspects of gaming a compelling leveling system great customization options for gameplay style reasonable grinding for new equipment and warframes so that each acquisition feels like an exciting accomplishment the sum of the parts makes the whole incredible its clear that the game is still beta thats certain but if its already at this point in its beta stage and still getting updates it has a lot of potential highly reccommended
recommended
surely everyone has already very familiar with the topic of outer space ninja ninja but the only competition in this game  warframe 3rd combination of rpg and shooting will give players the feeling rambo extremely  besides being able to build dojo for members of the clan improve interoperability between players with each other however game modes in the game are few and the environment in a few short game species and terrain changes automatically every time you play on the games special uproot game engine found a thousand words or experience the feeling of watching one ninja in space is like and if you still is one lone warrior in this macrocosm or join my clan wfo ign bogialat123

ninjas shooting aliens and robots with tech and  1110 proper review pardon my english  this game is fully free to play with slow and steady pace towards full geared with many different ninjas that you could get for free by grinding bosses mostly content for premium users is costumes and  but wait you could half of those by some random event ingame and premium users items is just for a quick good game therefore i conclude this game is fully free to play by an exception you couldnt get all of those cool looking ninjas and weapons in your inventory because you could only add slots with microtransaction the community is great i think dev is supportive too i got a quick responses for wanting to change my email id so i have been enjoyed for about 300 hours of fun smacking the enemies with so many interesting abilities the missions could be repetitive and boring but random generated map negates it a bit therefore anyone who enjoyed tpsgames should give this a try nothing to lose

warframe is practically the computer version of clash of clans figuratively it will addict you with hours of gameplay that keep you coming back with the just one more level feeling the graphics are amazing i play on low graphics settings for qualitys sake and the game looks comparable to halo 4 on the xbox 360 in terms of detail your eyeballs are in for a treat the levels are all the same structure you move from room to room murdering everything in your path with guns to bow and arrows to shurikens etc there are different level types exterminate spy assassinate defense survival sabotage and mobile defense each of these levels has a different objective that i am not going in depth ofmainly because the title says it all but they last 1015 minutes usually the length of the mission really depends on how far you are willing to push yourself are you going to murder an entire army or just the standing garisson the choice is yours this game has full clan support trading friends text chat and even a pvp multiplayer duel mode where up to 4 people can duke it out to see whose ninja skills are superior all in all its a great game for being free and even though repetitiveness sinks in quickly the tutorial doesnt give a lot of info and the storyline is nonexistent its fun and thats all games are supposed to be for the few gigabytes its worth i give warframe a 810

warframe is a pretty interesting game if youre reading this you probably already know that it is a coop shooter from somewhere and that it is in open beta the first thing i want to let you know is that these two categories are not seperate at all the core of this game is as much a shooter as it is a game in development a game that experiments and teaches both the community and the developers and of course a game with many unfinished features there are upsides and downsides to digital extremes decision of developing their game like this but i am without a doubt that the impact of saying lets release it publicly in beta and develop it as we go with our players on the end product of this game will be even greater than when they said lets make a space ninja coop shooter f2p game i could write about the stunning visuals that easily outmatch any f2p game to date i could write about the constantly evolving storyline and setting that seem as basic and simple as it is limitless or i could even write about the gameplay that easily combines a dozen different styles of games into one fastpaced progressionfilled insanity but i wont these arent what keep me in this game what keeps me in this game is the development itself the slowly building community and the potential this game has the developers themselves clearly learn a lot with every hotfix and update they release and it makes progressing through this game all the more interesting  seeing as the game is progressing alongside you a normal company would learn quietly through data and attempting different things internally but warframe has by far the most communityinvolved development team i have ever had the pleasure of interacting with this game is an experiment and so far it looks like its a successful one its still pretty far away from completion though you can choose whether you want to participate now or maybe youd prefer it as a more refined product you could choose any amount of time focus and interest that you would like to invest in this game and its development and it will adjust itself accordingly so yeah i recommend you try out warframe

i love this game sooo much but its a little too fast paced its a coop based game definetely but everybody can solo it without really any consequences besides being over powered which doesnt happen in tis game too much the game has amazing features such as mods i was once playing with a new bow and thought you know they really need to buff this thing and then i thought i really need to buff this thing because you can do that you can apply damage bonuses and different reload times and all these awesome things to youre sentinels weapons and warframe that makes them really unique you dont have to pay to get cool weapons and warframe sure it takes 1232 hours but in the end you dont pay real money for 2 weapons you may or may not like this game is so amazing its free 2 play so if youre trying to decide whether or not to get it get it its f2p and friggin awesome good work digital extremes you did good waffle

thouroughly enjoyable from start to finish although there isnt really a finish warframe offers the kind of addicting gameplay where you know what to expect and are still enthralled by it at the same time the game is constantly updated with new content and fixes for some of the games glitches and gameplay issues the staff are very responsive to the wants and needs of the community and they do a great job with it overall 810

the mobility in this game is insane the ability to flip around wall run climb jump over and jump off just about every object in the game is awesome good for all play styles whether youre a stealth player or a run in guns blazing player warframe can accommodate
recommended
for me warframe is one of the best free2play games in steam by the way it is a scifi third person game which offers a lot of entertainment not only featuring a lot of different missions it has also a unbelievable big number of different weapons you dont even need to fight with guns you can also use many different swords bows crossbows and a lot of other weapons and as i said its free2play so take the time to have a look 710

its ok for burning a little bit of time faceted enough to hold your attention

i highly recommend this game if your looking for a stratergy game with teamwork or a 3rd person shooter with a difference this is it in my opinion this is the best f2p mmorpg out there with beautiful graphics even on lowest settings and little to no lag you will be able to wall jump over fire and headshot grineer in the face while idk its raining and theres a huge background with an endless horizen if your looking for weapon customization then theres plenty from cosmetics to upgrades you can change the dps the accuracy and other weapony stats with mods you pick up from the environment while you can buy weapons with in game special currency you can build your weapons with blueprints which require materials this game is not p2w as it requires stratergy guile and teamwork unless your lone wolfing it to complete any level not just the biggest gun for some though they may find stealth dull so you can enter a room guns blazing with a multitude of different playstyles accompanied by warframes wich is you as a character there are a few 20ish and each one different in size background and abilities i recommend this game and would give it 2120 1110 7069 topmarks

i do recommend this game for people its a fun game that you can play with friends and just have fun and also its free

warframe love this game combat techniques are flawless and easy to learn with some combos on the way shop system is easy to browse and wonder through to buy anything you want and all weapons are unique in their own capable way same with characters they have their own abilites and can do whatever needed in your desire if you can play them well gameplay is not as repitive as their are different enemies maps gamemodes any much more already starting loving this game when i started playing the tutorial has a seamless story line that is fun to hear through and you dont want to skip any cinematics because the voices for lotus and many other characters are so well organized and thought out the developers did an amazing job making this game outstanding performance for a free to play genre as id love this as many other people who have commited more time in warframe there is only one problem that ive seen the shop system is a bot overpriced dont you think the same well something that i shouldnt be complaining about play this game and love it
recommended
this game has had me hooked on 3 seperate 3 month long occasions the only reason i ever turn away from it is because the friends i play with stop playing you need to be with friends to fully enjoy this game althought a cheeky farm run when no ones looking doesnt do any harm with a metric ton of customisation weapon types and upgrades this game fulfills my every desire many people bash it for the slightly glitchy moments but i really respect the devs for how far theyve gotten if i had one issue it would be that plat bought currency is too damn high in terms of price and they really need to bring that down and the f2p elements up if they want to keep the majority interested last little thing if you do get warframe god damn add me as ive got no one to play with

psst while you read this start downloading this game the amount of fun you can have with this is rediculous it is free to play 99% of the items you can buy can also be crafted instead so you can be 100% free to play but with limited inventory space its still really really fun to play with it even being beta the graphics are amazing as is the gameplay the devs for this game are the best as they know exactly what the gamers want when it comes to updates they actually listen to suggustions even thought there are a few bugs it is a very very good game with a ton of potental i plan to see happen edit a while now since trading has been added you can be 100% free to play with max space and all cosmetic items you can farm for parts and sell them for plat in game thus allowing you to buy everything cosmetic and inventory space
recommended
warframe aka bugframe the game where bugs are everywhere and and a place where you will grind a lot material for equipment you will spend lots of time trying to do the same level the same boss just to get that one freaking item to get that ing equipment i strongly recommend this game for the people who have lots of time willing to invest doing the same thing over and over just to get that one item that is so special until when you get it its not even special anymore but not for the  who have a life have something else to do will not get bored doing the same stuff over and over again

a very slick third person shooter the gameplay is smooth and very well done graphics are excellent the story if there is one gets rather repetetive but the extent of the character customization seems to hold a lot of promise somewhat lacking in cover mechanics although overall a very nice game

warframe is alot of fun best played with friends 3rd person shooter with powers and a good melee system well now anyway this game is awesome the things i like best are the amount of warframes to pick from the melee system and the devs they update alot and release hotfixes as soon as they canwarframe is free to play but i see it as pay to have more fun in the end though you support a great dev team and show them you love the work they are doing 9510 best free to play game imo

this game is one of the best free to play games ive played get it
recommended
although it says i have barely played 6 hours i have clocked in 100 hours of gameplay but only recently started using the launcher from steam i recommend this game for people who like 3rd person scifi shooter mmos but prepare for grinding grinding and more grinding to level up your mastery which in turn allows you to wield and use amazing weapons such as a laser rifle you dont really need friends to play this game although its largely coop you can just press play and enter a squad on the level you want to play or just solo it i do recommend though that you have the required hardware especially returning users since they have revamped the graphics requiring a stronger pc but not really anything past midenthusiast level builds are needed
recommended
fun game with friends but super grindy and repetitive eventually got burned out on it
recommended
the game is alright for people who like pve you can play in a squad of no more than 4 people there is a fair variety of missions large ammount of guns and customization options everything than can be purchased on the market with real money can be found and crafted in the game with hardwork and luck there is even some things money cant buy pvp lacks something fierce there is literally no point to it the pvp in this game lacks the feeling of just completely obliterating your oponent there is no real strategy and it just feels like a cheap cod arena if youre looking for a pvp game turn around this is not it
recommended
warframe is game that makes other fps look inferior its supposedly set in the future where tenno soldiers fight grineer marines for absolutely no unkown reason  possibly the soverignity of the solar system the game is also supported by microtransactions via steam dlc from the game is ridiculous the more you pay the more stronger and better you are but unless you actually put in time and effort to get the same results as the p2winners overall warframe can be naturally seen as a fps and p2w game this game actually seemed more new unlike the other modernday fps like black ops although the game can be seen as a p2w rarely any time and effort needs to be put in to acquire better eqiupment since materials for blueprints are fairly easy to get i rate this 710 or 70%

can be a very grindy game but the artstyle is amazing definitly give it a try if u want to be a space ninja

i want to start out by saying that unlike a lot of reviews this will be a critical examination of the game and its mechanics i do not wish to bathe it in praise nor cut it down at the knees i wish only to be critical it will be long and unlike all these joke reviews lol i cut a guy in half 1010 it will hopefully clarify just what this fairly complicated game is all about i recommend this game but let me say that my recommendation comes with many qualifications it is these qualifications that have caused me to form a very strong opinion very early in my gameplay experience luckily the developers of this game are quite intelligent and responsive and are always looking for ways to improve the game warframe is a free to play coop thirdperson action shooter on the evolution engine and it looks really pretty thats about everything i need to mention about the engine or it would be if the game wasnt so buggy fortunately the developers have decent priorities when it comes to supporting the game and they fix their bugs about as often as can be expected some people will have really bad luck getting warframe to run when i started playing i was not one of them first impressions were good combat was reliably fun and the wallrunning flippy combo movement serves to improve combat flow rather than feel arbitrarily shoehorned in like many other games with this kind of movement system the premise is simple do missions to unlock more missions to do and while youre at it experiment with some of the hundreds of unique weapons how you go about this is my first huge qualification playing the game solo can be near impossible at times you will want to join up with friends or random players on most missions because solo play has been specifically balanced to be unenjoyable for players just starting out luckily this isnt a dealbreaker but it might make your first dozen hours a little frustrating this brings me nicely to my next point which is that the community of players is far too small most of the time you will be unable to find a squad willing to do your missions as most players are too busy farming specific bosses or events once again this can be remedied by having friends who play with you but a majority of missions are often ghosttowns in public matchmaking the game isnt really driven by quests theres only a few real quests in total and they mostly serve as story expansion or advanced tutorials for mechanics you probably couldnt figure out without some outside intervention in fact the game is so poorly explained sometimes that i found myself guessing what interface buttons did on occasion and being completely surprised when they did something else entirely luckily the developers are making large stride in improving the quality of life in this game and unlike most free to play developers cough cough planetside 2 cough they actually listen to their playerbase and make attempts to assuage the largest complaints you also dont level up in the traditional sense leveling up only increases your pool of available mod points for the piece of equipment that leveled up you place mods on your equipment keeping in mind the limited capacity and you try to be efficient about it upgrading mods is yet another process whose intricacies are lost on anyone not paying careful attention youll want to keep a few good weapons and make them even more powerful through special items completely earnable without need of real life money purchases regardless all equips cap out at level 30 and youll want to swap out to another weapon once you do because leveling up weapons is the fastest way to level up your profiles mastery rank which unlocks further items weapons trades and other things so once youve wrapped your head around all of that recall that this is a free to play game meaning the developers have to make some money somehow aside from aesthetic purchases the marketplace sells additional slots for weapons and warframes meaning you start out with very few slots this isnt unreasonable but my logic is they wouldnt limit the amount of slots you could have if this was a pay up front 60 dollar game so where the free to play model loses me is where it costs more in the long run to get the same amount of gameplay from a free to play game versus a pay to play game luckily any decent player can earn additional slots by trading uncommon and rare items found ingame but you wont need to constantly buy slots you get your weapons very slowly anyway most weapons have to be crafted and after you grind the needed ingredients the weapon takes 12 to 24 hours to assemble my biggest complaint lies in the current mechanics of kubrows while playing youll get a quest to get a space dog bat thing to assist you in combat when you pay out the nose for the required blueprints grind the materials grind more money to make the items grind until you get an egg wait 4 to 5 days for the thing to mature you will be rewarded with a companion that literally slowly dies no you read that correctly while it sits in your spaceship your space doggity will slowly die and the only way to reverse this is to buy health injectors for 75000 credits for a six pack this is nothing short of space highway robbery most players who find this out immediately regret getting the dog thing and when a majority of players regret a gameplay element you know something has gone horribly wrong the worst part is they also sell robot companions that are armed with guns dont require upkeep and cost less in the long run it really hangs a giant question mark over the point of owning a batdog this isnt the only poorlyreceived mechanic sometimes youll attract the mark of an ai controlled bounty hunter by killing a highvalue target they have a slim chance to show up in the middle of one of your missions and fight you this sounds good on paper but in order to even have a chance against them you need to have multiple high level players with maxed out weapons with very specific kinds of damage it turns what could have been a thrilling raid boss into an arbitrary mission failure most of the time so yes play this game play through the prologue and if youre liking what you see so far continue playing it if you can do the following  ditch your space doggity in cryo sleep  pretend the bounty hunters do not exist just alt  f4 your game when they show up and you have no possible way of combating them  find reliable friends to help you with the most difficult mission modes and events  seriously the bounty hunters will just ruin your fun 90% of the time when you get ingame emails from them just hit the delete button while making a dismissive farting noise  handle the grind yes theres going to be grind but at least its more fun than most

so warframe its pretty good hence the 200 hours ive spent on the game im going to do the lazymans review pros and cons d pros the game looks pretty damned nice fast and responsive controls most weapons have a good feel to them a lot of content to explore a handful of mission types to try new content is being added pretty regularly a fair cashshop model for the most part will address it at the end cons some have had performance issues usually around patchtime ive heard a few weapons do feel incredibly underwhelming to use most of the levels do looks relatively samey with environmental variations on later planets grinding is the name of the game grinding for materials can be a complete chore earlyon grinding gets mentioned again because grinding so despite the game being relatively grindy and repetitive at times ive spent hundreds of hours playing the game why because i can dropkick a guy in the face spin around with my sword and make his arms fly into the sky then blast his friend in the face while lighting a guy in the distance on fire all in one fluid attack yeah those moments happen with such an absurd level of frequency its almost like the most bizarre anime and kungfu movies tied together with a scifi film and it works superbly i will say some people are put off when first starting the game because they see all these cool items in the cash shop and when i tell them how itll take probably a few hours of grinding to make it i usually hear but i want it nowwwww it happens even so its a fair model in my eyes you can spend time save up and make it yourself or spend time earn money at your job or however you earn money im not judging and spend that to get what you want so yeah thats my meandering review give the game a shot if you get the chance and want to be a badass breakdancing cyborgninja in space who is more or less a cyclone of death and destruction what have you got to lose the game is free after all im too lazy to come up with a good segue to finish my review so uh review end

the game is interesting after 100 hours u play and it gets extremely boring after 1000 hours first 100 hours u getting acquintance with game after all these years game still suffers proper training course or sorta i actually didnt realized that thing before my friends started to play that game and theyve asked so many questions from me id barely could answer all of them in first steps the player have extremely helluva lot of guns and they cant even decide what gun to test problem is 95% of them are all useless but nobody tells that in the end there is only 24 guns usually used the question is  why bother adding crappy guns after 1000 hours u realize the only thing that holds you  new guns and warframes all u can do  level up yer waframe profile rank via exping all of these  guns and frames theyve shoulda call the game farmframe  cuz that is all u do in here all those launchers and shooters are crafted with many many resourses and they need time to build reallife time i aint talking about guns wich are 1224 to build but about warframes which are 3d 12h to build in extremely good timing and when ye have all recipes and ingridients there is a kinda a lil storyline but its completely untracable for newcomers who da hell are tenno why earth is overwhelmed with grineers who are those creepyfunny corpus boys nobody will tell anyway i would give thumbs up it got me interested for more than 1k hours but i am very dissapointed in that game after 1k hours d

pretty much one of the best games ive ever played but that is largely due to personal preference this game is extremely grindy you will spend loads of time grinding for rare parts and resources keep that in mind for actual gameplay it is very smooth and the graphics are beautiful all the races are well designed with plenty of variants some really annoying like nullifiers there is a tactical advantage to stealth depending on what frame you play as some frames are weak in terms of tankiness but can kill pretty much anything in the way if they dont get hit others cough trinity cough can take literally any amount of damage and not die if you play it right this is advanced modding though see below the upgrade system is really well done using these special drops called mods they essentially upgrade the stats and powers of your frame and weapons you have 8 mod slots and a polarity system so you can make your slots more efficient if they match up with the mod when you first craft a weapon or frame it will have no mod capacity which you need to install mods as you rank it up by using it in matches it will gain mod capacity allowing it to become exponentially stronger the current strongest weapon in the game per shot is the paris prime which through the polarity system very rare mods and lots of time you can basically oneshot any enemy i recommend finding the parts for one as soon as you become comfortable with the thought of using a bow against massive amounts of enemies that can lategame oneshot almost all players the advantage to it is that you can do the same to them the trading system is good but needs some changes i think the ingame currency that players can buy or trade for from other players is platinum which is used to either trade players for items you want or to buy things from the official market the problem with this is that players can essentially get any prime gear they want if they pay when really it is meant to be as a last resort if that one item you simply must have isnt dropping for you there are loads more things in the game because de does actually add a lot of content every couple months companions archwing tactical alerts boss fights and even more expect large updates every 12 months with bug fixes and lots of new content to satisfy you if you have no patience and no time dont play this game you will either rage quit from not getting the things you want quickly or become addicted and then lose control of your life i put 100 hours into this game over the course of 4 months and took a break from gaming when i came back i put another 400 in 6 months i do recommend this to those who enjoy playing with friends though teamwork is one of the most major aspects of warframe and without a good team it is guaranteed that you wont make it far

warframe the game about rocket launcher wielding space ninjas so much potential for awesome unfortunately this game just constantly shows the problems in random number generators hunting for specific mods weapons and warframes for months on end that you may never get does get irritating after a while currently all there is to do in this game is grind then grind some more after that there isnt really any end game nothing to do once youve sunk 500 hours into the game and have your preferred loadout i really like this game but until it has that something to keep you going once you have everything you want its hard to keep playing it grinding the same missions on the same tilesets over and over or attempting to aim for leaderboards that refresh every week on defense or survival gets old quite fast also try to find people to play with grouping up with randoms will lead to frustration quite fast that being said it is space ninjas with rocket launchers rng is a thing in nearly all games though some have ways to guarantee youll get what you need and hopefully adding some meaningful endgame isnt too far off might as well give it a try

if you want a game thats close to dead space without the jumpscares shooting & slashing enemies to pieces yes all in good gory fun or just want a good excuse to raise hell this game will fit the bill many weapons to choose from even if you dont want to spend a cent you can build premiem weapons and warframe with blueprints found in levels plus the many modifications to choose from found in drops can can create a deadly weapon to blast a enemys head off literally though if teaming up with others online mode expect to run a lot considering they rush through levels happy hunting >

this free to play game is a very nice and well done game that has a nice story and clear cut gameplay with the diffeent ways to play the game i am finding it a very enjoyable experience the only problem i find is the importance of microtransactions to get the best weapons and warframe but the game is very enjoyable non the less i would recommend this game to anyone who likes any shooters because this has almost everything a diverse shooter needs

warframe is an amazing free to play that bends the regular free to play model by allowing you to get literally everything free ingame even cosmetics that you would expect to pay for with real world money quite an amazing game with a great story and lore too

awesome co op third person shooter note  think of warframs as mech suits just for this review there is a rather tangled lore behind this game i am not going in to for spoilers sake quick over view space ninjas yes that picture is actually what they look like in game pros omg it looks awesome for a space game all the warframs and weapons look like they could be 3d printed right now co op is very fun almost like borderlands 2 but less of that slap stick humor some what customizable you can change colors for your warframe and your weapons though the color choices are small to start with and unlock more as you level you will still have to spend real monies to get more colors this being the only thing you cant unlock in the game play style flexibility so far it has your basic flexibility until you unlock other warframs so close range mid range and distance my current load out is bo staff shrunken and bow and arrow three starter warframes tank  close range distance long range with lighting and a jack of all trades this will expand in to a wide range of warframes including one that is support and one that is healer pyro  frost  gravity driven warframs exploration this game rewards you for exploring doo it  free running is your friend ninja run up walls and across gaps find the thing cons ftp grind to win or you can just ptw yes it is a ptw game this can be a real turn off for a lot of people but being in beta maby they will add a way to earn currency in game its in beta bugs incomplete animations but hay its in beta it is free ps4 vs pc so far it is sported on two platforms but they can not cross play yet just like eso it is not yet ready to talk cross server difficulty scaling may be a tad harsh i am playing solely with kit so we are 2 manning it  can up to 4 man it i think if we were soloing it it would be much harder this may be to nudge people into paying for upgrades with currency and make grinding harder playing coop we are fine just noticing my bow sniper weapon is no longer 1 shooting mobs learning curve this game has a bit of a learning curve the in game tutorial doesnt really tell you how to do things it mostly just point and says figure it out this only make a huge difference with the mods fusing the right cards can make some unbelievably powerful mods

a game about space ninjas weapons powers and of course parkour totally reccomended if you wanna have some good time one of the best things about this game is that its completely free yes there is microtransactions that you can use only if you want to because everything can be obtained without wasting 1 penny 1010
recommended
its space ninjas does more need to be said fluid combat with an emphasis on awesome acrobatics and hypercool weaponry more than a dozen different warframes each with their own play style await you within so what are you waiting for grab your space katana and go cut up some nasties
recommended
like destiny and mass effect 3 rolled into one except its good 1110

in the grim future of the 41st millenium there is only grind this aside its quite a fun game beautiful and stable and the devs regularly add new things i liked it

great game though its rng galore it perfectly combines the space 3rd person shooter that mass effect had and adds parkour skill for a fast paced high action game 910 edit and if that doesnt sell you valkyr has a nice booty
recommended
the game has beautiful and explicitly to the thing i liked is the stealthy  moving graphics and stages
recommended
its a great game nice graphic & no need high spec pc u must play this game 
recommended
oh god great game you come in you do not come out

its like farmville with guns
recommended
first person game like this not bad to play with your friends or even your girlfriend aint gonna hurt if you try this have fun with it
recommended
its ok
recommended
mesa takes 1 year to farm plez nerf aside sometimes absurd grind the game is cool
recommended
warframe is simply a tps where you grind to get equipment that will let you to grind faster for even better equipment etc
recommended
combine mass effect with diablo add some ninjas and warframe is what comes out structured around 4man instanced missions warframe has a large variety of map objectives with random secondaries being added during the mission overall the randomization is pretty strong piecing together gigantic levels that are easy to get lost in exploration is rewarded with rare mats bonus cash and exp for all your equipment the leveling system doesnt increase the stats of your gear but instead how many mods you can slot into your equip and how strong combined with a low level cap of 30 for each gear piece its easy for new players to jump in while veterans are rewarded with stronger mods everything in the cash shop apart from skins & colors are purchasable in game or are craftable my only major complaint right now is that the environment variety is a bit slim overall warframe is a well balanced third person shooter with tons of customization and replay value

bought platinum got banned till 2024 for hacking 1010 would buy platinum again

lets be real this is a review board and youre here because youre trying to decide whether or not its worth your time playing this game in any case in terms of gameplay and graphics its pretty clear cut this game has both bases rather covered great graphics and great gameplay while not at aaa level its a free game after all but before you get this game consider these points 1 are you an mmorpg fan as in can you sink hundreds to thousands of hours into a single game live with the blessings and the curses of rngesus and grind the same dungeons over and over again for hours on end to achieve the sweet taste of progress 2 are you interested in going in and asking for help from strangers joining a clan providing for that clan and overall being an active player furthermore do you have friends that can play with you 3 do you have tons of free time 4 are you fine with not ever being close to achieving endgame 5 do you realize that nearly everything within this game can be received for free its rather hard to discern this when your arsenal shows all these weapons that have cash prices on them and i made the bad assumption that this game was going to be a p2w game which it isnt 6 are you looking for an mmorpg with shooter elements rather than vice versa if you can answer yes to these questions then jump right in ive sunk 300 hours already and plan to sink more the community is one of the greatest if not the greatest and the people you meet are almost always helpful as long as youre not in the trade chat where everyone is trying to make a profit and may be rude as hell if you cant really say yes to the pointers above i would suggest you look elsewhere and move along

this game is a thirdperson pvp pve shooter type game where you develop your character max that character get a new character max that character find the most op character max it out max your weapon find the most up weapons max those out then make a doge kubrow i can easily say doing all that takes time and effort or you can pay for it like a little  i would give this game an 7510 due to the content it provides you can farm for items which gets really repitive but they put different maps in for the same mission so you can never really get to tired of it you can trade which makes somethings easier to get than others characters are easily customizable as well as the assortment of weapons you can get the variety of missions always keeps things interesting the variety of character can satisfy everyone there is a tank a medic a stealth character and many more that fit the type of gameplay you want to have it is fun and exciting an think everyone should try it out d some of the bad things about the game are that you can pay to win but you can get those items through time so i wont complain about that
recommended
alll i could say is that this game is worth the time downloading if you love wow diabloiii or any rpg game like wow this is the perfect game for you
recommended
great game and it is free so give it a shot you play as one of the tenno and you use a warframe there are quite a few but you get to choose one out of a few for free from the start you take on various kinds of enemy factions grineer corpus infected in different kinds of missions given to you by lotus more or less the leader of the tenno across many planets you can unlock more planets as you accomplish certain goals on top of that there is a place called the void that is quite difficult and requires a key to enter 4 tiers of difficulty in the void you have the potential to unlock special items only obtainable there that both look better and function better than their normal counterparts these are prime items the combat is quite good and fast paced and its all in thirdperson though fairly straight forward it isnt necessarily easy youll want to move around a lot which can take some getting use to as a tenno you can be very acrobatic you have a health bar and a shield bar as well as energy which is used up when you use your warframes skills as you play you gather materials which allow you to build new weapons of which there are many types primary secondary melee and subtypes of those as well as companions sentinels which are floating little weaponized creatures and kubrow which are a lot like dogs and new warframes basically your battlesuit for you to use which each have their own unique appearance and skills there is also something called an archwing that allows you to do an entirely new kind of mission where instead of running around in a ship or on a planet you can fly though space killing your enemies spaaaaaaaaaace in addition to building things you can get a lot of drops called mods there is a massive amount of different mods out there mods can be used to improve your warframe all of your weapons and your companions as you level your gear up you can equip more mods you can also sell mods fuse many mods into one to increase its effect best of the three options or fuse many mods together to gain one random better mod in addition to all of that you can buy quite a few cosmetic things as well for your warframe your weapons your companions and even your ship liset your ship liset is quite important its your hub for access to the market codex syndicates foundry arsenal and more the game allows you to join or create a clan which gives you access to a clan dojo where you can gain access to many useful things over time theres even a sentinel the djinn that can only be gained by owning a clan dojo and building a biolab you build various rooms with materials and anyone in the clan can contribute there also are factions you can join that are either broken off from the grineer corpus and tenno or are something entirely unrelated to them these factions are the steel meridian arbiters of hexis cephalon suda the perrin sequence red veil and new loka they all have different standings with each other allied opposed and enemy and you can join as many as you want by helping them you can gain special rewards only obtainable through them however be aware that be helping some your reputation can go down with others and by joining syndicates there is a chance that very difficult enemies can spawn in and attack you there is also another powerful enemy that has a chance to spawn in and attack you called the stalker this enemy is attracted by killing bosses the more bosses you kill the more of a chance it has to spawn in future missions great game download for free and get your friends in on it theres much more i could discuss but ive already written a massive amount so find out for yourself

grindy but nice

this game needs your wallet and you must feed it your wallet
recommended
nice but needs a graphics preset to make it no more graphicly intense than tf2
recommended
this game is sorta like a roller coaster you start playing and the majesty of the whole lays before you and you want to continue playing to watch it all pan out eventually however it comes down to you solely looking forward to playing with a new weapon so you farm for it pretty decent farming that doesnt get too old but the mobilegame style wait times on builds for weapons gear and warframes make it rapidly annoying so you stop playing you peaked quite some time ago now youre just done wait a few months a year even and all of a sudden you decide hey i havent played this game in a while why dont i see whats new well good for you you have some fun but you realize all the new warframes are like 10 times worse to get than the previous ones however new game mechanics and flashy physx effects pull you back in after that little warframe hurdle even after a year the game manages to hold the same aesthetic of ninjas in space but constantly expanding both the ninja and space mechanics the only true downside i could find is that after recent updates the game runs worse for wear but upgrading some computer specs and using a half decent computer can still make this game look a hundred fold better than other common games out there if youre looking for whether or not you should try this out id say go for it worse thing thatll happen is you waste an hour or two downloading and your computer just cant handle it if it does work youll get more fun out of this than you will with 99% of other f2p games theres a reason this has sat at the top of the best f2p games list for so long go give it a shot if you havent already
recommended
do i recommend this game hell yeah i do great combat and movement large selection of weapons and characters frames to build andor buy no pay to win everything is obtainable from playing the game though you can pay to skip and just have the items wheres the fun in that great co op game for 4players lots of things to progress towards keeping you busy for hundreds of hours the very best support of any game i have ever played any problems are very quickly patched out unlike alot of devs taking weeks to fix something they mess up these guys generally sort it in minshours sometimes a day or so and support tickets are always answered for a free game there isnt a better choice at the moment
recommended
awesome shooter
recommended
this is a great game kind of boring by yourself but if you have a few friends get ready for countless hours of slaughter sweet abilities sweet weapons and upgrades i keep reading reviews where people whine about the cost of platinum i have yet to spend a dime on this game and was able to get all the top end warframes weapons and mods selling parts for plantinum goes a long way every single thing in the game is achieveable with a little patience

warframe is among one of the best free to play games you can getif you can run it even with my high end gaming laptop it still has lag issues but besides that its really fun to play new content and updatesfixes are administered quite frequently and it has gotten more content since i first tried it when it came out there always seems to be an event going on which makes it more fun to jump in and play a word of advicedo not go and buy the weapons and warframes why because its more fun to gather the ingredients to make them you can basically make any of the items weapons warframes and sentinels with blueprintsif they arent on the market youll eventually collect them if you always wanted to know what it feels like to be a parkour ninjathis game is perfect otherwiseits definitely worth a try anyway

this game is probably my second favourite freetoplay game first one being lord of the rings online but anyway the thing i like about this game is that you dont have to pay for stuff in order to get good gear and get good at the game if you dont pay then you gotta grind but to be honest this game is all about grinding and thats what makes it fun the grinding is not too boring and there wil be random alerts popping up every now and then and having good mods or blueprints as reward this game also has modding you can mod your warframe and weapons and make it stronger than ever before mods can be acquired in missions this game also features a very good clan system you can make a clan and start making your dojoyour clans hangout place and then research weapons and what not this game also features pvp which i dont find too fun but yea this game is about pve its a good third person shooter overall and the best thing is its free and the games graphics is just epic play it play it play it play it

weeee this is alot of fun but i veiw it like new age armored corethough this with actual online game player base still not quite armored core hell nothing really is but free to play dont be a weenie give it a go bet you have some fun
recommended
this game is very fun but i dont think its for everyone it starts a little slow and to really have fun you would need some friends to play with the game can also be a grind fest but a good one at that some people may say this game is pay2win but they are very wrong every thing you see in the store you can get in the game with a exception for the cosmetic items there is several different frames characters to play as and many different weapons to fit any play style lastly warframe is a game where you may never run out of things to do im 1000 hours in and there is still so much i need to get done i recommend this game to everyone just play it its free

badass 3rd person game if u like crafting gamefarming game u would like this
recommended
brilliant game its free but if people so desire they can pay to advance further or not youll still enjoy it a mixture of tactical thirdperson shooting and fastpaced freerunning and melee combat this game has communityminded features such as clans and alliances and gamewise its got a huge number of varied mission types playstyles and gear aesthetically its beautiful you dont need a diamond encrusted alienware to run this at top graphics settings almost everything looks good and it runs very smoothly on most systems an excellent plot voice acting and mission selection modding and inventory system add the fact that it is still technically in development meaning that theres constantly new content coming in and youve got a masterpiece in the making ive enjoyed this game since beta and have done so with spending a very little amount of money as a founder to support the development i would advise anyone who can get this to do so youve got nothing to lose and a lot to gain
recommended
holy  kind of nice game
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played constant updates and developers who listen to the community makes games like this even better i strongly reccomend this game as long as you dont mind grinding and a little rng hassle although there is not much mission diversity customizing your warframe and getting new weapons is where this game really shines
recommended
realy recomend it to anyone who likes grinding games
recommended
be a space ninja and planet hop a dystopian solar system while grinding your face to the ground to climb the mastery ranks be warned as this is a game which is better with friends youre gonna have a bad time running solo so get with some friends and play this game if you dont have any friends that dont play itdont want to play it then youre ed overall i very much approve
recommended
great graphics fluid gameplay and a variety of weapons to use a great free to play game
recommended
its called grindframe for a reason the cake is a lie but not the grind the grind is true who does not want to be a space ninja jumping around wall running doing cool acrobatics and slicing enemy fodders to half played it since closed beta stopped for a few months when the grind got unbearable returned when theres major updates stop again rinse and repeat started playing again and this time i put the platinum and my trading skills to good use to get those cool gold prime weapons i never gotten in the past because i never ran any void with random people games been more mindlessly enjoyable with the ability to do void now and get some prime weapons whether to farming or trading other than that theres nothing much to this game you grind you wait for events wait for baro tikeer the swindler wait for rare alerts thats about it an eight out of tenno
recommended
a buggy grindfest made by developers with no idea what theyre doing or how to balance anything 1010 would grind for hours again
recommended
in my opinion its one of the best f2p games ive ever seen daily events fully customizable equipment and a mod strategy to make your own weapon the best on the whole universe as i said before its one of the best because you can get the 90% of everything by just playing the game on graphics side youll puke from the high quality but remember remember tto turn of the motion blur or youll feel dizzy the first 5 minutes of gameplay on gameplay side well on the beggining it could be a bit annoying boring but once you get blueprints new weapons clans and know the game mechanics which are easy to understand youll love this game i sometimes think i have way too much hours on this game id give a 83100

man considering ive pumped almost 500 hours into warframe a game i originally did not enjoy id say its worth your time that is however dependant on your viewpoints regarding both third person shooters and also science fiction themes it also may require a bit of patience so if thats not your thing or you cant enjoy something for the sake of enjoyment please try something else warframe is at core somewhat of a grindfest at current but for some people myself included this can be made fun with a little imagination and a simple appreciation of the way the game handles and looks you play as a warframe whom is tasked with various objectives and goals in missions that you select from a series of nodes you unlock as you progress across a map of our galaxy these range from capture  wherein you chase down and kill and then absorb a capture target before extracting whilst being shot at by mutlitudes of enemies  to things like survival and defense which involve trying to keep your life support system above 0% by slaying foes and collecting the life capsules they drop and defending a warframe pod that contains a cryofrozen warframe soldier inside respectively there are more missions which i will not go into detail about but they can all prove fun the game is primarily free to play although has a microtransaction system in place that allows boosters weapons and warframes themselves to bought outright this balances out toward people who dislike grinding to achieve things the only things i would consider paytowin and they arent truly as they can still be attained  though rarely  freely through alerts are orokin catalysts and orokin reactors these items are onetime use and boost a weapon or warframes modification capacity respectively allowing you to change and add more to the ojbect in order to increase its power or to make even cooler builds the game up to this point was not entirely userfriendly and much of its mechanics and nuances had to be learnt via friends or guides or just by simply asking in game but recently a new addition  the codex  was added to the main menu ui that allows tutorials to be accessed freely so thats cool now onto the cool part the warframes they appear as exosuits or armour that encompasses a person and they grant mysterious and awesome powers that pertain to each different frame volt for instance has abilities that let him control and manipulate electricity in the level killing enemies and shielding allies with it he is just one of plenty unique frames and all are acquirable for free your only restraint will be slots in your inventory to hold these frames and weapons too though this can be increased via buying platinum  the paid currency or trading for paltinum if you find a rare item story is a bit limited at the moment and so is the endgame but this has been slated for fixation by the end of this year or even earlier to conclude warframe is cool

warframe addresses the issue of the racism back in 1960s in america warframe does a wonderful job compelling the player to explore new adventures with nothing but african descendants in his mind saryn is a great addition to the game showing that reptiles can also have fun with nothing more than a whim on a stick and 13 platinum i would rate warframe 16320 great game that is totally worth the 60 bucks

before i even begin my review warframe is still an open beta there are always glitches bugs and issues that accrue the ire of many players but de the company behind warframe is next to always on top of releasing patches warframe in a brief nutshell is a spaceage scifi ninja hackandslash with an intriguing storyline the prequel to warframe is dark sector where the tenno  the race every player is  has been pushed back into the void and has only recently come back to find the sol system in the middle of a threeway war between the militaristic and brutish grineer the greedy and technological corpus and the overwhelming numbers of the infested the tennos role in this game is to bring balance back to the sol system by assassinating key personell from all sides who threaten galactic stability gameplaywise warframe is  at the time of this review  very grindy such as other mmorpgs to level up one has to fight the enemy collect resources a drop from enemies or by releasing a titan extractor to systems collect modifications a drop from enemies and clear planetary systems usually by defeating the boss weapons are unlocked via purchasing blueprints and crafting them with ones gained resources and one must also have the appropriate mastery rank on paper your overall player level separate from weapon levels warframe levels and sentinel levels which is leveled up by leveling up warframes and weapons weaponwise combat feels visceral and satisfying for the most part some weapons have become outdated while some have begun to shine the warframe you control determines how fast how wellarmored and what powers the players has with a general rule that casterclasses have low shields health and armor but possess potent powers and fighterclasses have high health shields and armor but have less powerful abilities than casters there is a realworld currency market in place but 99% of the items sold there can be madefound by playing the game itself the 1% of items not found are purely cosmetic such as color schemes and syndanas capes the realworld currency to game currency ratio in this authors opinion is quite unbalanced however 75 platinum the game currency is $5 usd with bonus platinum being awarded depending on how much one purchases in one transaction for example 180 platinum is gained from $10 usd 150 being from the $10 and a 30 platinum bonus warframe is able to be played alone but is much more enjoyable and beneficial with friends or a clan with a moderate amount of startup resources one can start their own clan or can simply join a preexisting clan to save resources clans offer clanmates to join games with a player clan technology which offers highend weaponry and miscellaneous activities such as 1 v 1 pvp in a dueling arena trading and obstacle courses finally warframe has a dedicated forums page to report bugs meet with potential clan members introduce yourself make suggestions offer feedback or generally just shoot the breeze with fellow players pros multiplayer with clanmates or friends is enjoyable and practical everything save for cosmetics can be obtained without real money solid swordplay gunplay and warframe powers complex damage system which promotes a wellcoordinated squad and a variety in weapons many side activities many graphics settings can be changed so lowerend pc users dont have to worry as much forums have a decent active community cons prone to glitches and bugs after major updates but are rectified quickly playing solo can be tough at higher levels and bosses real currency to game currency is at an uneven ratio damage system can take some time to learn and master grinding for resources can be a bore at times

ever wonder what happened to digital extremes the other half that worked with epic games on the unreal franchise theyve been having a rough time of it it seems their third person shooter dark sector was met with mixed reviews and quickly forgotten they helped 2k with the ps3 version of bioshock and were then tasked with creating the tackedon multiplayer portion of bioshock 2 from there they developed the illfated homefront the underappreciated the darkness ii and then the rushed and buggy movie tiein game star trek into darkness after such a long and rocky road its no surprise to see them seek refuge in the untapped frontier that is the free to play market warframe is a kind of spiritual success to dark sector you play as a tenno an ancient warrior awoken from a very long cryosleep into a universe at war the grineer  humanoid clones with degenerate genes  want to rule it all the corpus being a mega corporation with robots wants to own it all the infested infected with the tenocyte virus that turns them into biological weapons want to be everything so the tenno are tasked with saving the universe from this crapstorm the game has been in open beta since early 2013 but update 14 has finally brought it into what i consider a reviewable state keep in mind free to play games update frequently and so change dramatically often update 14 brought a muchneeded tutorial prologue chapter and the entire user interface has been overhauled the core game is mostly unchanged but there was very little wrong with it to begin with after selecting a mission you and friends or strangers are dropped into a procedurally generated map there its all thirdperson action combat with wallrunning sliding shooting while sliding leaps backflips and sweet melee combat as you earn experience your frame weapons and companions like a combatcapable spacedog pet you earn via a quest level up gaining more slots for mods mods add various effects to your attacks like fire damage more ammo or give you special moves there are many mission types and missions may have random effects added to them like fire damage across the map or a sudden infested outbreak so youre fighting them along with whoever is supposed to be there special effects randomly trigger around the solar system which give you an opportunity for bigger rewards at higher risk warframe follows the monster hunter formula of farming specific bosses for the plans to craft certain weapons or frames you can buy frames or weapons with real money but everything can be earned ingame if youre patient except for fancy cosmetic items like spacescarves

warframe is a fast paced third person action shooter with decent rpg and adventure elements mixed in to create a very very enjoyable free to play experience i cannot fit every aspect of this game into this review so i will be highlighting what are in my opinion the most important key features of the game the general plot and setting of this game takes place in a scifi themed perspective of our solar system in the distant future where two factions the corpus and the grineer compete for territory and power while avoiding hazards like outbreaks from the infestation and tenno intervention the world is ever changing maps you play are procedurally generated with different tile sets and themes depending on what planet youre based around the corpus and grineer are constantly invading each others territory allowing players to pick sides and decide who will occupy that territory until the opposing faction is ready to invade again infestation constantly plague regions of the galaxy allowing tenno to help thwart them with enemy factions for the greater good warframe offers a very fast paced smooth yet gritty and meaty combat system players are able to find a wide assortment of weapons warframes and abilities to play the way they want to play ranging from being a stealthy hunter able to execute your enemies from behind cloak and dagger style sneak through patrolling squads to quickly reach your targets without sounding the alarm or test your bowmanship or sniper skills picking off enemies from afar or charge in guns and swords blazing dismembering anything that stands between you and your assignment and you think support classes in most games are boring warframes support and utility classes offer very fun abilities and play styles that not only give the player an enjoyable experience but greatly help out your team or offer for very leisurely solo gameplay on top of combat movement in this game is one of the best in the genre often joked for being a game about space ninjas you will find yourself running along and up walls leaping and flipping through the air over and on top of the enemy and sliding about skillfully through levels making traveling something to actually look forward to weapons warframes sentinels and miscellaneous gear are obtained through a very fair and balanced crafting system blueprints are obtained by purchasing them in the ingame shop for ingame currency or found through various mission styles while the materials are obtained through different areas in the solar system while many pieces of equipment are available to buy through microtransactions almost everything can be crafted in game with the exception of a few cosmetic items and discontinued event items the game is designed to allow players any type of experience they want whether you want to play alone or with up to 3 other people although certain level types are obviously easier with a friend or two almost everything can be done alone and difficulty will scale to your current gears progress one thing i find is a double edged sword with the current game is level design the game is primarily procedurally generated with preexisting rooms arranged in different orders and different themes depending on the levels location in the solar system while the tile sets themselves are very well designed you will find yourself going through the same rooms over and over again throughout different missions and sometimes within the same level however because of how fast paced the game is it is not an issue for most players and does not affect gameplay whatsoever from what ive seen and experienced there are only two very minor vices to this game microtransactions and clans platinum is a currency that can be purchased by players to either buy gear or cosmetic items however warframes and weapons themselves cost ridiculously high amounts of platinum encouraging players to craft them from scratch in game which may be time consuming but isnt difficult in most cases additionally prime gear and other alertevent related items are not purchasable and using microtransactions will not necessarily give players an advantage over their friends one of the main reasons i personally buy platinum is for cosmetics like custom color palettes and aesthetic attachments for weapons warframes and sentinels however considering how much content you get in this game for absolutely free i would argue that they are more than worth investing a little bit of change into if cosmetics are something you enjoy in games the other issue although not nearly as significant would be clans specific warframes weapons and other gear are only obtainable through clan system crafting in the dojo which forces players to join one if they want to have access to all the content however you can get away with having a personal clan or with a couple friends as research and crafting scale to clan size one of the things that stands out to me the most for warframe as an mmo is the developers and the community as an overall it is extremely community driven and the developers are closely closely involved with their game adding hotfixes for big and minor issues almost daily to ensure the best experience for players new content is added almost weekly and large scale events happen every month or so something pretty insignificant that i make a big deal out of is that the in game developer messages for patches or hotfixes are absolutely hilarious and they do listen and respond to general chat channels often warframe is definitely worth investing some time into i have yet to find a freetoplay game that offers as much content as this game without pressuring microtransations the combat style is extremely unique and fast paced and allows players to play exactly the way they want to good luck tenno

fun game but the downside is that you have to put in a lot of hours and the repetitiveness of the levels would eventually dull ones senses yes there is a pvp game mode but rarely are people logged in there plus you dont get to use all your abilities and items obtained from grinding in there you play with a skeleton warframe defeats the purpose of getting abilities and items in the first place there should be more of a storyline too one of the perks is that the community is friendly and players are always willing to help one another progress through the game

great fun brings the player to new world where running around and shooting stuff doeasnt make you win you have to use your chracaters warframes abilities and accesories here to go through a map or you dont even have a chanche if you dont have a tactic with your specific warframe and other parts of the loadout
recommended
really fun pve shooter the ammount of content in the game really surprised me a lot more features than i was expecting and you can enjoy every single one of them without spending a dime wanting to collect all the warframes and upgrading them really keeps you hooked at the very least this is a game worth checking out

great game with a good community

all around great game played it a bit too much

developer to be purchased by perfect world entertainment i do not recommend this game if that is that case avoid it gameplay a the main attraction its got fastpaced gunplay and swordplay mixed in with parkour and scifi eviscerate your enemys in violent bloody explosions and shoot guys legs off or chop them straight in half with your sword  warframe is a hell of a lot of fun but the downside to it right now is the repetitive stages and missions theres still a lot of bugs right now but this is excusable because this game is still in beta story not much of one currently not much going on in the story department right now for warframe all you really know is that youve been woken up from cryostasis to fight these guys called the grineer and these other guys known as the corpus so you just wake up and start slaughtering literally hundreds of people because some lady with a funny hat told you to more recently theyve begun doing more story related events and improving on this aspect of the game so theres probably something to look forward to in that regard crafting its ok but there are restrictions a little overwhelming to new players because crafting looks and seems like its impossible but once you start putting some time into wiki and unlocking stages it becomes simple to find the right resources and craft the weapons and warframes you want just set a goal for yourself play and youll have the items you desire at no cost except for some time and effort the wait time for crafting in warframe is a huge turn off when youre a brand new player because youre itching to get away from the god awful starter gear and onto something more fun so that can be quite frustrating but later on once youve actually got some stuff for yourself made and youre more comfortable with your gear the crafting wait becomes more exciting you start to look forward to the completion of your new gear once theyre finished and while those are building you start hunting for more resources to make the next thing on your list the biggest mistake in this game is limiting the number of items you can have and only letting you get more space by spending real world money  this is  and you should be able to use your credits to purchase more inventory slots if it werent for this id have given this system a thumbs up clans time consuming but very rewarding clans are sort of like the hidden second half of the game start a clan to work on building up your dojo with some friends its a lot of fun you have more things to work towards and gives you more reasons to actually do missions for materials other than making guns and armor  youll be able to access weapons and research not avaliable from the basic store pages visuals stunning in most right places very lackluster in others the corpus ships are gleaming and sleek while the grineer ships are grimey and industrial with dim lighting void ships are decorated in shining gold with flawless white walls and have glass pipelines with flowing water in them that you can see into but the desert tileset is extremely ugly and the game uses a random color correction filter to try and make the stages seem a little different each time but they end up just making the stages look strange and unfit most of the time the character models are packed with detail and the weapons are sexy however if you want to customize your warframe with a full color wheel youll have to dish out some cash and unlock them with platnum music nothing special the music in warframe is inspired by japanese drums and thats about it just drums and some metal clanking hopefully the game gets a real soundtrack someday will update review as the game gets updates
recommended
for a free to play game its beautifully crafted and very entertaining with descent difficulty for all types of players and nice grindfarm system for those that love to farm for best gear give this game a go and try not get addicted xd

despite its mediocre score from metacritic this f2p online shooter  it really isnt an mmorpg so if youre looking for depositing skill points in strength or whatever this game isnt for you  is above average in everyway solid musical tracks beautiful graphics awesome gunplay and devastating sword attacks make this game one of the best free to play games on steam yea i guess you could say it is p2w but everything that you can pay for to make yourself great you can get in game on top of that its free how could you go wrong i enjoy warframe and if you give it a shot you will too thats for sure unless you dont like awesome swords robots killing shooting awesomeness cool stuff more cool stuff bullets cyborgs drones astronomy the milky way galaxy amazing graphics and even more cool stuff that is all

great game with coop story mission modes which is kind of hard to find in fps nowadays the pvp has serious balancing issues but overall the gameplay is fun and reminds me of uncharted 2 combat would be nice if they eventually explain the lore a bit more

welcome to doorframe a competitive farming simulator your goal in this shitheap of a game is to test your button mashing skills particularly the e key in order to cut down swathes of enemies that range from l4d2 zombie ripoffs to giant ing armoured behemoths the real test of skill comes in when you reach the crafting system after completing what not even a nonfunctioning autistic could call a story be prepared to sleep on this game as i have for about 100200 hours of my gameplay time because if you want a fancy new weapon youre going to have to wait at least two ing years building a new doorframe is entirely out of the question taking at the bare minimum 3 and a half days to complete all in all my rock hard boner for this game is slowly dying like my will to live someone kill me

extremly addictive fun and original the gameplay and combat system are very fluid the variety of weapons waframes and mods lets you chose the play style you like  straight up in your face stealthy support or tactical are some examples getting the components to craft items takes a while it really is a grind to get better weapons or warframes wich personally i really like in my opinion this game has the best pay to win system of any f2p game instead of having to pay cash to get extremly good gear that you coudnt get without paying like most f2p games paying just lets you get the item immediatly instead of grinding to get the components to craft it or you could buy colours or different heads and such to customize your character an extremly great f2p game that i would gladly pay 60$ for
recommended
i love this game

this needs bigger bosses and new people to be shooting at and more custom moddingother thoughts needs more dogie

why the  is this free to play this game should at least be 40 dollars at least if not full retail price its ninja gaiden metroid prime series and star trek all combined in one if that wouldnt make you play it what will oh yeah theres also little to no grinding it all happens naturally and you want to grind if you want to grind theres nothing saying you have to but the grinding is fun in this game start playing it
recommended
warframe is the best pve coop fps i have ever played no exagerration pure fact active developers many events a lot of different weapons and frames every big update brings something new and epic
recommended

if you like grinding ninjas bows kunais and swords then play this game pls
recommended
i was going to complain about the unclear level layout the need to pay for customisation and repetitive feel about the game but then again it is free so it was well worth the 000 i payed for it
recommended
ok so let me start off by saying no this is not a pay to play game you can get almost all the items in the game for free in the sense of federal funds ill decide to start with the bad news oabout this game bad things 1map systems are terrible half the time you wont even know where the exit is on an infestation level  2wait time for the ridiculous amount of time it takes to make practically anything basicly explains itself but its cheap way how they get money [get ready to empty your wallet to speed up things] 3its a glitchfest you will run into at least 10 glitches in one week of playing i would let this pass since its f2p and the fact that il lt constantly updates it to fix them but they are countless and its going a while till they perfect everything good things 1beautiful graphics given youve got a good enough pc the graphics and colour variations are great epeacially with colour correction on 2gameplay this is definatly a given since you probably know by now a game with space ninjas and guns each with various powers and customizable looks to boost morale and overall expirience is very good 3constant updates this game recives tons of updates so many that you should never really grow bored with the game given you arent still starter and dont know what to do like i was i reccomend looking at mogamu and some of the guides are very helpful httpwwwyoutubecomusermogamutv overal this is a decent game but it definatly could use some work add me if you want to discuss it further in depth
recommended
i was only thirteen years old i loved warframe so much i had all the weapons and frames i prayed to warframe every night before bed thanking it for the life i have been given warframe is love i say warframe is life my dad hears me and calls me a  i knew he was just jealous of my devotion to warframe i called him a  he slaps me and sends me to go to sleep im crying now and my face hurts i lay in bed its really cold a warmth is moving towards me i feel something touch me its nyx im so happy she is my favourite warframe she whispers in my ear this is my ship she mindcontrols me with her mindcontrol ability and puts me on my hands and knees im ready i spread my keyboard and mouse for nyx she penetrates my tv screen it hurts so much but i do it for nyx i can feel my screen cracking and my eyes start to water i push against her chaos i want to please nyx she absorbs my love and roars a mighty roar as she fills my screen with physic bolts my dad walks in nyx looks him straight in the eye and says its all chaos now nyx leaves through my window nyx is love nyx is life <3 1010 ruined my life
recommended
good game shame its pay to win good shooter
recommended
this game sucked up all of my time and is pretty much the defining game of my college experience anytime i play a game i play warframe super addicting but in a good way time is definitely money in this game and often the majority of your time is spent in crafting sweet new weapons and warframes updates are constant with new content being released often if you love fastpaced ninjas sprinting around with superpowers shooting and slashing everything in their path this games for you
recommended

this game is awesome it made my eyeballs explode
recommended
update 14 has really made the beginning of the game more playable i would absolutely recommend it now pros lots of customizations you get to feel like you earned your new gear plenty of variety interesting gamemodes great opportunities for teamwork each update brings a brand new ui cons crafting new stuff sometimes requires days of grinding crafting things also takes time ie 12 hours 24 hours 3 days etc you only get a limited number of weapon and character slots people can pay to buy pretty much anything with real money which sort of kills the sense of accomplishment for people who earned their gear
recommended
amazing game it migth have micro transactions but most items are obtainable in other ways
recommended
the greatest free to play game ever thought of update after update digital extremes delivers great content and it rewards those who work reguardless if you have money to put into the game or not you can in the end get pretty much any item without money highly recomend this game to any person
recommended
great game play in a world where large security forces are always the grineer a world where even organic corpus somehow leave a heavy robotic signature warframea game about ninja robots from another dimension tenno10 would frame wars again

a rather nice game for a f2p and you can still have quite allot of fun on it without buying anything with real cash would say its a good game to try i my self spent over 200 hours on it and would say that quite allot of people play it not to mention updates and events are rather offten and the game gets new content ones a month or so
recommended
i <3 this free game
recommended
fun cooperative experience with very fluid and friendly controls wrapped in beautiful visuals powered by nicely optimized engine
recommended
the game is a lot of fun but repetitive so it can get boring fast its a lot more fun if you play with friends so that its less boring at a certain point progressing does require you to pay for more weapon or frame slots if you dont then you will have to trash  remake and lvl up what you already have to continue progressing your rank lucky the slots arent expensive
recommended
dis game is fun lyke minecraft but more better than sd
recommended
warframe grows on you the more you play
recommended
i r t3h ninja 119 scratch that this game is really fun but its a free2pay game not play pay you cant get anywhere unless you are either playing with friends or you spend a bunch of money on weapons that you dont need like seriously people spend your money on something wortwhile like a slurpee even though its a pay to win game it still has fun mechanics and gameplay and surprisingly good graphics overall i give this a 710
recommended
has guns with ballsacks 1010
recommended
you guys this game is great
recommended

play it and join my clan d  the cult of satan 
recommended
fun at first then it proceeds to get very very very repetitive
recommended
an extremely satisfying blend of rpgmmo progression and satisfying 3rd person action based gameplay warframe is definitely a game worth picking up for the low cost of free
recommended
if you have a pack of friends to go with you this game will be a blast everything is simple enough so you dont need to worry too much but still complex enough so that you have room to learn to improve your gameplay and character build movement is very well done and flows nicely though dont dive in expecting a grand story behind the game warframe is a solid 810 game for a f2p game it is very well done and has a lot for you to do
recommended
warfram is a solid co op shooter the shooting is fun but the it takes ages to unlock anything and the ai is  but with amazing combat and cool aesthetics i can over look some of these flaws 7510
recommended
dont forget your visa if the grineer come around ignorance is no excuse for an expired document

this game is a fun game that links with the xbone and ps4 and is kinda like destiny in a way overall a good game
recommended
proof that metascores dont matter like roger eberts opinion on movies you can choose to play the game and enjoy it or like the critics you can give it a 67 without even recording 1 hour of playing time
recommended
this game has a great potential not the best game out there but a very good one 7510
recommended
this game is amazing for a free to play and the only bug that i have found is that once in excavation the scanner stayed at 100% power and the drill wouldnt spawn but apart from that and a few clan dojo glitches the game runs really well 1010
recommended
warframe is an amazing game for emphasizing your playstyle each weapon is suited to a specific playstyle or adaptive to make it fit your playstyle this also can be said about the warframes themselves mods further enhance playstyle to the very elements you want to fire out of your gun while it is a grind after that first loadout is bought and you have a new melee primary and secondary weapon it becomes a game of using awesome mods and unique effects for each gun to mow down hundreds of enemies in different ways using abilities lets you master the flow of combat another thing great about this game is the animations while they are triggered by player use on some which can be a bit sudden all animations look so smooth and each weapon even has unique combos stealth kills finishers and so on i would highly recommend this game to anyone and its ftp but not necessarily ptw the developers themselves said that everything in the game besides color packs and excalibur prime the donator frame is obtainable for free grinding to get a new weapon can be fun with friends and the combat is so satisfying most of the time
recommended
if you like endless grinding look no further
recommended
excellent coop lots of updates packs are a bit over priced though

in warframe you play as a tenno a member of a species of ancient warriors that have reemerged to lay waste to the various nefarious species populating the solar system your foes include the grineer a jackbooted army of deteriorating humanoid clones the corpus a mixandmatch crew of robotic and human parts and the infestation a bunch of shambling organic creatures that vaguely resemble the flood from the halo series while your enemies are visually uninteresting a lot of the tenno suits and weapons have a great sense of style that imbues warframe with a spark of personality each species has a cursory backstory and there is some lore to be found buried in the menus but theres no narrative thrust or intrigue to speak of and so you run mission after mission moving outward from the sun as you level up your loadout and become a more proficient killer the core combat of warframe is straightforward this is a thirdperson action game in which you wield two primary weapons and a melee weapon against foes who are largely content to come right at you you also gain suit powers that allow you to dash and slash through a bunch of enemies or stun all foes within a certain radius though these abilities can change drastically depending on what suit you equip you could unleash fiery maelstroms turn invisible create a decoy use teleportation to switch places with an enemy or manipulate your foes to fight against their allies acquiring new suits however requires a significant investment of time or money more on this later regardless of what powers you have equipped you can often wage effective war against your enemies by firing on them from a distance then slicing up the ones who manage to get close this tactic grows tiresome after a while however and doesnt serve you well as you take on tougher levels fortunately you can combine your ability to jump sprint and crouch into an acrobatic array of slides flips jump kicks wall runs leaping slashes and more though theres a certain rigidity to your movement your mobility is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about warframe and its fun to zip around your enemies slashing and shooting until the only ones left standing are your fellow tenno 710

its looks like a p2w game when you play at the middle but its okay as long u have friends to accompany you and i think every mission feels too short and then the price of items is too expensive for a low budget gamer the graphic is okay and add more weapon 710 gameplay 810 graphic 710 equipments

one of the best free to plays i think i have ever played including demos and mods and to those who say its pay to win dont listen to them they are just trolling the review its actually quite balanced first 3 free classes are some of the most powerful ones now if you want to spend $10 usd than go ahead get a new class but all you are buying is a completly diffrent skill set all classes have their own uniqe play style so do youre homework and look them up on the warframe website

its very fun also good for waisting time but after a while you start to wonder what kind of drug the team was abusing when they decided their prices for platinum

warframe is a free to play construction simulation game here you and your team of tenno home improvement and weapons must complete a vast array of timed contracts for your many customers the game features some unforgetful characters such as captain charles vor a retired navy captain from the grineer naval school and alad whats in the bag v a board member of the corpus lumber yard the games name refers to the warframe a special tool the tenno use to beat their competition in contracts it is a special tool belt and vest that surrounds its user in high tech grade a tools from harbour and freight 810 really fun game but lots of grinding but fun enough that it doesnt matter f2p and not p2w so thats good

its the kind of game which you either love or hate depends on how well you take grinding also big thumbs up for the community

warframe may be a bit grindheavy and waiting for your items to build is a pain warframe is a really fun f2p thirdperson shooter mmo thankfully unlike most f2p games almost every item in the game can be obtained in some way permanently without use of any real cash if you are willing to invest the immense amount of time to do so no real pay to win  here just pay to speed things up this is a pretty good model in comparison to  you see in nexon games for example aside from rushing items or getting rare orokin catalystsreactors and forma 3 very important items to leveling up outside of events that give them out for free the only things you necessarily need to pay for are costmetics such as color palettes and armor decoration when you get your first bunch of platinum the ingame realmoney paid currency hold onto it and dont waste it on guns get the blueprints instead those can be retrieved with normal credits which are free by playing or anything that isnt necessary use your plat for cosmetics or orokin catalystsreactors but only if you urgently need them then and there and there isnt an event available as for the game itself warframes gameplay is fastpaced and frantic theres a huge emphasis on both ranged and melee combat and the melee system is really neat kind of combining typical tps melee combat with a god of warstyle combo system there is also some parkour in the game allowing you to run along and up walls vault over objects and do slides spindashes etc the guns in the game are for the most part satisfying to use and feel beefy such as the latron and leveling them upmodding them is surprisingly deep and complex mixing damage types depending on what faction youre fighting is very important and something youll be doing regularly same with applying mods that build on a weapons strengths such as fire rate damage mag size etc the enemy ai while it definitely isnt the smartest it is coordinated and different enemy units will try to flank you take cover and some brave units may try to hunt you down and find your position if youve run out of sight however extremely rare if a fight is going south for the enemy theyll flee which is also interesting to see you progress through the game by playing various missions of different types some involve simply killing everyoneextermination defending an object of interest from destruction defense defending multiple hackable terminals mobile defense and much more theres a lot of variety and almost every mode save for extermination requires some level of teamwork with the archwing update coming out soon the game will be a lot more diverse adding full space combat to the mix as well this is one of the most anticipated updates to the game thus far and with good reason its a big gamechanger literally the biggest downsides to the game are that the voicechat sucks and has horrible quality the game can be very buggy  freeze prone at times the netplay can be bandwidth intensive you can only have parties of 4 players on a mission and theres a lot of older weapon mods and warframe abilities that are currently becoming less viable as new content rolls in and other elements of the game get new featuresimprovements the new stuff ends up leaving older stuff in the dust in short digital extremes the developer plan on rectifying this soon thankfully in short its a great game it still has issues but those are quickly evaporating if you like fastpaced cooperative action with some rpg elements thrown in plenty of loot decent ai satisfying guns and lots of bloodgore youll like this game as a slightly offtopic note  digital extremes who made this also made one of the best games of all time unreal tournament 2004 alongside epic games back in the day so give that a look too

this game is cool but is a resource hog to be sure i know its still in beta but it takes a monster pc rig to run it in highest settings but it still looks nice enough in lower rez  medium settings if you turn a few things off it controls nice enough with an x360 for win pad  it lets you remap the buttons its a photo realistic game so it looks awesome since its f2p dl it & give it a try

very good game indeed hours of fun alone or in coop mode
recommended
im going to sum up this game as simply as possible it is a repetitive grindy game you should know this going in do not expect a massive variation in what you do now the fun stuff a parkour system  wallrunning sliding flips vaulting all that cool stuff while firing guns 4player coop its not an mmo a good f2p model only stuff that you have to spend real money on are cosmetics  weapons can be crafted using resources gained from missions and blueprints bought from the market for credits gun modding and stuff customise your gun to make it more effective against specific enemies or just make it set people on fire clans guilds armies whatever you want to call it you share a dojo a communal map that you all build which allows you to unlock exclusive clantech weapons adorable sentinels they fly around above your shoulder and shoot stuff they are adorable 9610  not bad ign goty

recommended
the new updates are just making a good game even better
recommended
ive been a member of this community from when it started and i can say that is one of the greatest ive seenand that is given by the fact that the developers are in a really close relation with the players and they give them what they want and morelike they said the company is in the players hand when i first saw the teaser to the game i knew it would be successful and i dont regret a single hour spent playing this gamethe gameplay its amazing and its designed by youyour choice of warframes and weapons build your experienceyou can definately find a warframe of your taste but my proposal to everyone is to try them all because every single one of them offer a different experience sometimes it can get repetitive because you will need to farm for resources but get 3 more friends to play with and you wont even notice the time flying
recommended
when i first started playing this game a couple of months ago i was definitly confused with the mechanics the mission menu almost everything basically except the gameplay itself i ended up learning how to do the things that were initially only understable if you tinkered around self teach yourself how it all wokrs but with one of the updates that make the mission menu simpler to follow a more comprehendable control tutorial and most of all it teaches you what you need to do outside of the game that i only knew when i self taught it or looked on wikipedia this game is coming along nicely only thing id ever have to complain about to this point is the play to win catch i feel inferior playing against those who buy crazy armor and weapons or even the simplest designs but thats not really something that makes me hate this game i love it

basically its a fast paced super sentai game you are a badass in spandex in the future slicing punching and shooting at bad guys at super speed if you are decent or trying to avoid death git gud mango bosses are easy and youll enjoy this piece of software at least 3050 hours until you are forced to grind forever to acquire a new pair of metal breasts for your space waifu play alone or with one other player never join 4 player missions because its a cluster grafixx 810 sound 310 gameplay 710 p2w ratio 610

totes mlg much wow

while fun the game has three free classes to pick in the begining the other classes are avalible with by use real world money to buy in game points to obtain the other classes with the most expensive ones being about 20$ wareframe plays exceptionaly well and is just plain fun especially with other playersyour friends however because wareframe is free the majority of the gameplay is essentially paytowin due to the better items and other classes being available through the use of real world money thats not to say that wareframe is a bad game because its not but this one aspect is enough to be a huge turnoff for some people
recommended
this game is amazing by visuels graphics everything about it is awesome a must get now
recommended
game is just like dead spacemass effectwarframe
recommended
youtube game footage does not look as nice as the actual game if you have a high end machine just try the game out and you wont be disappointed
recommended
warframe is a good scifi coop mission game which has promising potential to be a great game but right now contains many annoying bugs which need to be fixed for it to be great there is still much more room for improvement such as the user interface and animation set if the developers can fix some basic issues they will potentially have one of the best games of its genre right now i give this game in september 2014 a 710
recommended
its like mass effect 3 but good
recommended
first ever online multiplayer game that made me to play for hours this game delivers smooth gameplay with enjoyable game modes

warframe in my opinion is an underrated game for being a freetoplay game it is pretty good its a fun challenging single or multiplayer game i would recommend it to any scifi fans
recommended
wownice game
recommended
i absolutely love this game its very versatile and open to pretty much anything you want to do with it whether you put money into it or not its a thirdperson shooter which is probably why i love it so much id definitely recommend this as one of the best freetoplay games available on steam
recommended
its a very good game
recommended
great game awesome graphics  good story line the game moves at the pace you want it and the game will teach you the basics of how to play the game youll get easily caught up playing with friends for hours at a time 1010 score from me
recommended
ninja aliens this game made my day 
recommended
this game is amazing have played for a while and will continue to play every update brings new fresh content in a unique style of play not found in any other game the one problem is learning to play the game the tutorial could use some inprovement but aside from that the game is flawless 1010 side note if you are struggling to learn something there is a lot of support provided on the games forums and within the game in various different chat channels
recommended
this game has everything that a person wants fricken ninjas in space dogs killing people swords guns badass warframes and for the guys sexualize warframes that will probably give them rageboners im just saying
recommended
so here is the deal warframe is aweful honestly 010 would not play maybe maybe 210 cuz swords other than that this game is lame you force yourself to play a few hours however becuase it has gotten higher ratings than some of your favorite games so youre in around ten hours and you get to your first level 30 weapon you have since then purchased andor found other weapon parts and intended to build a superior weapon to the weapon you currently have you give it a shot and holy dear lord is it good and it felt pretty satisfying coming out of the 12 or 24 hour oven foundry so you play with that for a while and have a decent amount of fun so okay games not great maybe a 510 at least its free but becuase this new weapon is pretty good you want to see what else is on the horizon rinse and repeat until about 40 hours when you realize that youve covered most of the starchart and have a few good weapons rinse and repeat until you can take down anything in the starchart very fast rinse and repeat until you can take out the stalkler in one hit with a meelee weapon rinse and repeat until you can last to 45 mins  on t4 survival etc etc etc 1010 god tier game would recommend even dropping cash on teh game tldr graph of y  x where x is how much you play and y is your desire to play
recommended
quite good and a gr8 coop game
recommended
very fun and you can slice people in half
recommended
the badass simulator 910
recommended
not even captain bright made me this happy
recommended
i have a positive opinion of warframe you can have access to missions thanks to higher level players an there is a huge range of customizations for your avatarwarframe i also want to point out that u can have multiple warframes in order to experiment which is the best for your kind of playing style its really good and i strongly recommend it
recommended
completely rehauled game and to top it up its optimised too love the graphics the gameplay and fighting experience too recommened for ones with scifi fighter feel
recommended
its a really great and awesome game d problem is you still need to register at the original website p but to those who are having doubts i tell you this download it >3
recommended
if you want to be a freaking space ninja with guns and have stealth elements this is the game for you
recommended
its a amazing and wonderful game full of action adventure and that splash of violence that just makes it great though in the first few days or months depending how much you play it is difficult mainly in money and resources but that will soon end and best of all you dont have to worry that much about upgrading since all warframes have unique abilities and traits to decide on so i would definitly recomend this game but for people who dont like 3rdperson view space travel guns lazers swords bows robots and ninjas turn your head and find a different game
recommended
grinding and running simulator space ninjas with energy guns so much hate with laggs and crushes with weak notebook why love this game qooo
recommended
 story  they were called tenno warriors of blade and gun masters of the warframe armor those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins now they are needed once more the grineer with their vast armies are spreading throughout the solar system a call echoes across the stars summoning the tenno to an ancient place they summon you allow the lotus to guide you she has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive the grineer will find you you must be prepared the lotus will teach you the ways of the warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers come tenno you must join the war i think in my opinion is one of the best f2p games i ever playedit has weapons space ninjas archwing character costumization santinels your very own pet called kubrow and more the best advice i can give you is take your time and dont buy everything you see on marketalmost everything you see there can be createdoptained through hard wark and patience i definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for this kind of gamesthats it now excusie me i need to get back and save the humanity
recommended
want destiny play this instead save yourself $60
recommended
most graphicaly detailed mmo ive ever seen love the game play having a sword and bow in space is a fun new spin i found that the mouse sensitivety is more sensetive than a menstrating teenage girl who was just dumped on prom night even after i turned it down almost to zero this gives the illision of extreme lag which can  you off everything is also shaped weird as in enemies and such like there armor is plated over bursting tummours which have serverly deformed them but this keeps the game interestin and fresh runs pretty smoothly
recommended
game rocks d maybe the best ninja game ever
recommended
i heard this game was repetetive and even early on i can see how people say that but it looks like theres a lot of depth to it and its interesting enough im gonna keep playing for a while
recommended
warframe is the best game i played so far on steam  it has amazing graphich and the best gameplay that is evolveing every daybut it has repetiv ad that is its only downfallbut when you surpass that its amazingyou can chose betvine 100 weaponsfireing and meele and dosens of sutis with their uniq powers so log in and have fun
recommended
well after more than 400 hours of playing this on steam and another 200 of playing on their louncher i can say that the game got me though it gets repetitive if you can look over that and become part of the community youll never get bored of it
recommended
this game is the greatest its like halo assasins creed and destiny had a child and it was an mmorpg
recommended
i think this is the best game i have ever played i usally finsh a long game in a about 300 hours but this game i have nearly got 400 hours into it and im not even a quater way through it is a great game for users that like scifi third person shooters well you dont even have to be into scifi to play this game
recommended
really fun and graphic are amazing
recommended
amazingly fun consistently interesting looks and feels fantastic at the same time not for everyone its the sort of game where you will need to change to progress without the gameplay changing simultaneously it does require a great deal of farming to get around paying for the cool stuff if youre the kind of person who enjoys taking on the same challenges from different angles and in different ways warframe is the best game possible for you the multiplayer is great allowing you to have a ton of fun with your friends
recommended
this game is not free 
recommended
seriously the best free to play game ever
recommended
great game to play with friends very diverse character builds and awesome animation
recommended
this game is massive amounts of fun many unique and familiar art styles blend seamlessly and are seperate enough in their theme so players can recognize different factions with ease the crafting system will not appeal to casualgamers so much but dedication is well rewarded
recommended
you just have to play this game its pretty addictive and have space ninjas what else do you want well there is more infinite farming maps plenty of bosses plant of customization options if you like ninjas and stuff you just have to play it 
recommended
good game and its free
recommended
highly addicting game everything can be earned in game without spending money this is a true free to play game and i recommend this game to everyone come and become a tenno

warframe is a great game for some people i am one of those people this game is very innovative because of the way it takes mmo and mashs it with a singleplayer game the controls are nice and accessible and are also easy to learn i myself use a xbox controller for many games the xbox controls for this game is also nice and feels good the special effects is phenomenel it looks amazing if you have a good computer i love the wayu you can slide while shooting use a sword to decapitate and how eyepopping it looks on my monitor so yes i would extremely recommend this game to another
recommended
an interesting game so farits based on teamworkwhich is crucial in this gameyou cant simply go rambo on enemies like call of dutycause you would get gangrapedyou also need tacticssuch as sneaking and covering behind objectsi reccomend it and wait more people to come play with me
recommended
this game is really awesome like mass effect 3 multiplayer without the redundency and the headaches i dont want to say too much or all about the game because that ruins the fun the plastyle is basicly a coop shooter grinding fest so go grab a few buddies and kill some  click here to get started [warframecom]
recommended
you have to try it i cant get enough of it
recommended
even though it is a grindathon for resources the gameplay and unique mre than make up for it
recommended
i recommend this game to all my friends its very fun

its an ok game

i really like this
recommended
nice gamed
recommended
once you get into this game you will find it riviting
recommended
this game is good its a nice little third person shooter with absoulotly stuning graphics and really good detail but that doesent mean it is without its problems so to cut this review short should you downlaoad this game yes
recommended
such a good game
recommended
this game is fun at first but each level is basically 1 of 4 maps and it gets really boring
recommended
excellent game i totally recomend this for players that look for an gmae with lots of action and new combat systems and a lot of diversity within all clases
recommended
the best free2play game today 3rd person shooter with amazing graphics and gameplay it is not pay2win unless you have money to buy things instantly but you can still have the full experience without paying you must try this game out if you dont have it or never tried it i would rate this game 910 because the only thing i dont like about the game is that its all about grinding and sometimes feels repetitve if you play with friends its more enjoyable you dont even need a gaming computer for this my laptop with intell 4000 graphic card can handle this game on low settings dont look at the metascore it doesnt deserve below 70100
recommended
did you really believe it would be that easy
recommended
great leveling system nice combat and movement tho a little repetitive
recommended
the purpose of this game is to grind so you can use whatever you grinded to get in order to grind towards something else just to repeat the cycle
recommended
best f2p game u can get in steam
recommended
this is a awesome game
recommended
i quite enjoy this game i have fun nailing my enemies to walls with my attica and ripping things in two with my nami breaching lines western bandit style with my revolvers and sending many to davy jones locker under the guise of a pool of water with my hydroid frame care for a swim
recommended
i really enjoy this game its not pay to win but you can purchase pretty much everything in game with real money for those of us who cant spend all day playing update 14 just released and overhauled the entire ui and added player ships and a new companion give it a try

recommended
fun simple i didnt but i recommend paying for ingame money cause it will make the game 100x more fun i think the only flaw is how much the p2w money costs
recommended
expect to pay for everything cant make it through this game without using your money overall great gameplay
recommended
super good game would strongly recommend this game i would give it a 910 score
recommended
this game is one of the best f2p games ive ever played and even on low settings the game still looks awesome

warframe offers a fastpaced thirdperson shooter experience with a large variety of weapons to choose from and decent controller adaptation movements are absolutely fluid you can slide climb wallrun and all sorts of fantastic things all while shooting your gun alternatively using your melee weapon will also have different moves based on if you are in the air sliding etc and you can even charge up for a massive swing on top of that each warframe class if you will features 4 uniqueish powers that help you to manipulate enemies and survive combat these aspcets combined make the simple act of killing enemies highly satisfying oh and did i mention youll be levelling and upgrading your weapons and armor missions are between 10 and 20mins usually with randomized levels using a decent number of chunks and a number of different mission types and you will progress across stations on each planet which will eventually branch out and give you a lot of paths to work with now on to the critiques you will only find 3 different types of enemies in warframe and one will only appear from time to time however each of the enemy factions feature a decent variety of units to engage which keeps combat lively with the variety increasing as you progress across planets still you may get tired of fighting the same units over and over and the gameplay you experience from day one will essentially never change but simply become more difficult this is a problem for some but not all some missions feature essentially endless gameplay with ever increasing difficulty so depending on what you are after it may appeal also you can build everything you need in the game without setting foot in highlevel missions which is both good and bad for obvious reasons next are weapons yes there are many no they are not all viable some are infinitely better than others but have a mastery requirement so you will have to level other weapons and frames to obtain the best weapons there are many ways to modify your weapons however and testing weapons becomes a critical part of the gameplay next is community some players like to run through the whole level without killing things when possible you may find yourself doing this as well at times but as a new player it can be extremely difficult to learn to keep up without dying and solo play to set your own pace can be frustrating for the new player running out of ammo mobs from behind etc those who can adapt and play through to challenging difficulties however will not have an issue with this as they will quickly assimilate to the games culture some levels are flagged informally as farming zones in which players will use their warframe powers to decimate massive amounts of enemies which may be disheartening to some players but you will still get experience for these kills if in range still many players are belligerent and will refuse to cooperate with others in the team environment making the most aggressive player the one to set the pace note that these players do not tend to appear too often but they will from time to time that brings us to powers great at lowmedium levels supplements at high levels because there is little motivation to play high levels many players choose more fragile warframes with aoe powers to decimate mobs quicker and ones to quickly traverse the levels and attempt to get every kill there are kill leaderboards this can cause problems for players who are levelling as experience has a very short range on it as well as consistent enemy spawning since spawn points move throughout the level as the players do here are some nice redeeming qualities however about the game you technically never have to spend a dime on this game to play it and do everything the game has to offer you can build every weapon and warframe and even construct your own clan dojo guild hall and unlock the guild only weapons in this manner individually without purchasing the formoney currency and many players will buy fully upgraded mods for said currency my opinion overall is its free so try it you may not get into it at first but it is worth playing the skill base is limitless and while it may take a little extra time to get the hang of some aspects properly it is an excessively fun game especially with friends also this game is still actively being updated and added to which helps boost my rating 78% approval lacking in variety of gameplay but still high in excitement
recommended
nope
recommended
still addictive after sooo many hours of gameplay
recommended
fun for those that just want some mindless shooting fun and good for those that want to spend time tweaking their characters fun for all
recommended
run gun rinse repeat hope your team isnt idiots
recommended
free to play game fun time with friends online
recommended
its awsome
recommended
in my opinion the best free to play game they are adding even more stuff every now and then
recommended
what can i say ninjas with freaking guns now im not huge into shooters but the ninja & playstyle of the game is what snagged my attintion very fluid combate & ease of controls makes this a swell game for hardcore & new comers alike a muct have if youre looking for something fun diferent & very entertaining
recommended
is good i like it but the problem is a total lack of african american warframes
recommended
love it im addicted
recommended
space ninjas need i say more great game all around third person shooter game with a decent selection of weapons across all types shotguns rifles lasers grenade launchers pistols akimbo pistols needle guns flamethrowers and more oh and did i mention you can melee too everything from katanas and broadswords to dual axes and polearms and a freaking glaive a melee weapon that you can charge and throw that returns to your hand how awesome is that add to all this a super fluid parkouracrobatics system a deep engaging crafting system and ongoing updates and events a all the way also one more thing its free
recommended
game is amazing that is all
recommended
absolutely amazing and well done love it <3 3
recommended
space ninjas play for free free to play defines this game extremely well the fact that most ftp games are pay to win this game is the exact opposite this game is play to win sure you can spend money and buy things but you can literally unlock everything except for colors slots and aesthetic features in game there are items in game that you have to play to unlock you cant buy everything the play style of warframe is amazing its pve with groups of four sure you can run solo but its a lot more fun to play with groups the beginning is somewhat slow but once you hit around the third planet and you figure everything out this game is simply amazing the graphics are breathtaking i could go very indepth about this game but ill let you decide if you enjoy it or not just think about this one phrase spaceninjas
recommended
who dose not want to play as a space ninja killing creepy looking bad guys oh you well go away then
recommended
warframe review this game can be very fun i personally give it an 810 and i believe its pretty damn good advantages  has great graphics better than alot of games out there  has interesting factions and interesting weapons and grineerish is just pure awesome  most of the game can be accessed for free by crafting or as login rewards  the whole solar system is free and can be done with any warframe  every warframe and weapon have advanteges and disadvantages this makes them fairly well ballanced  the game is free to play disadvantages  some items cannot be aquired for free they must be bought for platinum  the game has microtransactions which is never a good sign but they dont give any overpowered items  colors are not free palletes cost 75 platinum each along with most cosmetic items  platinum is very hard to get without paying money  ridiculous crafting times starting at 12 hours to 72 hours overall i think this game is worth a shot i have been playing for almost a year now since the early beta if you are willing to pay real world money for platinum i recommend waiting until you get a discount as a login reward i also highly recommend doing research on the wiki before craftinbuying items happy hunting tenno  crazy
recommended
just call me fred durst cuz im rollin rollin rollin rollin
recommended
space ninjas with magic do you really need to know more this is a really good game and i love how anything youd need to better your play style be it mods warframes or weapons you can earn where as the only thing you have to spend money on is asthetics like color pallets and syanadas but of course if youre market savy you really dont need to spend money to get plat p
recommended
best coop game i ever played
recommended
1010 i love this game its more suited to play with friends but you can play solo if you want to there are also clans you can join and have your very own dojo with the newer updates its a bit harder but everyone likes a challenge right
recommended
the most boredless game d
recommended
big recommendation warframe is a bad 3rdperson coop shooter and hack & slash game offering an amazing and refreshing variety of playstyles influential & fluid skill builds challenging game mechanics randomly generated levels hordes of foes that will test your metal and spectacular graphics surprisingly highly optimized this game is literally an amalgam of the best elements of the fps and rpg genres all in one tightly bound package ffs who doesnt love space ninjas
recommended
this is why they cancled fez 2
recommended
this game ruined my life 55 stars
recommended
warframe is a fun and busy game never a dull moment once you are in a mission one of my favorite things about warframe is the foundry the foundry is where you can make warframes and gear with the materials you have found throughout the game makes you feel like you have accopmplished something and you get to show off what you made
recommended
this  be off the frame

overview ok so warframe is an overtheshoulder shooter developed by develeoper extremes it takes place many many thousand years into the future with diverse warframes whose users are called tenno and a whole arsenal of weapons gameplay gunsword fighting is fast paced enhanced by warframe abilitiesdifferent tile sets with predetermined rooms organized differently make each playthrough of a level unique players have a shield that will absorb damage and while regenerate over time as well as health that does not regenerate and causes the player to die when it hits 0 enemies have levels with higher level enemies having better stats such as damage armor health shield etc warframes this is your character you can team up with three other players this group is often known as a cell each warframe has unique abilities movement speeds health and shields the starter warframes are excalibur a warframe balanced in health shields and speed with powerful blade abilities a sword flashbang and super jump making him able to fill any position in a cell mag a warframe that moves slightly faster than average and with increased shield but reduced health manipulates magnetism to restore allies shields as well as magnetise enemies so that bullets are pulled towards them as well as pulling enemies to her staggering them she also is able to magnetise enemies bones to break themselves the third and final warframe is loki an advanced warframe that is the equivalent of a twig when compared to other warframes but is able to easily avoid enemy fire with his amazing speed and abilities his abilities allow him to create a decoy to draw fire to swap positions with enemies or allies at range make himself invisible and even jam enemy electronics so that they are forced to resort to melee these are only the starter warframes and will serve you very well even into late in the game more warframes can be created by finding blueprints of warframe parts from each of their corresponding bosses you must craft these parts of the warframe with resource then buy a rather expensive warframe blueprint the actual blueprint to the warframe and use those parts to craft the warframe construction of a new warframe takes three days but is very rewarding once you are in a completely new power suit weapons of course you need a weapon in order to dispatch enemies you will start off with a braton mark i a famaslooking rifle a lato handgun and a skana onehanded blade as you progress through different planets which all drop different resources you will find enough resources to start making new weapons whose blueprints may be bought from the store construction of a weapon will either require 12 or 24 hours weapons range from a plasmafiring minigun to a sawblade launcher sentinels sentinels are robotic pets that follow you and aid you in combat each sentinel has a specific ability such as the dethcube with a machine gun and vaporize ability that is the equivalent of a taser and the dethcube with a semiautomatic shotgun and vacuum ability which collects nearby items for you mods essential to the survival and combat of a warframe mods randomly drop from fallen enemies they are organized into 5 categories common uncommon and rare nightmare and corrupted mods are called rare quality they can be applied to warframes weapons and sentinels and will uniquely enhance the items they are applied to making a single weapon unique with different mod builds on the weapon enemy factions the direct enemy in this game is the grineer a vast army of warriors who have been cloned repeated and seek to take over the world with sheer numbers men and women with completely destroyed bodily appearances and strengths caused by cloning degeneration they rely on armor and shieldtearing weapons to defeat the warframes they have a natural hatred of the warframes being the only people able to stop them from their goal of world domination but i just think theyre jealous another enemy is the corpus a faction based off of economy and profit they have hightech laser and plasma weapons able to shred warframe armor and equip themselves with powerful shields but lack bodily armor to protect themselves once their shield is down they only want to kill warframes to dissect and salvage them selling the pieces to the highest bidder the third and final main faction are the infested a manifestation of the virus that infected the tenno and gave them their powers they charge and kill the tenno on instinct and can be considered the zombie infection of the future with enemies being evidently infested versions of the previous two factions mentioned maps the players starts at mercury and will eventually unlock other planets going outward from the sun almost all planets have their own unique boss new unheard of planets have been added to diversify and increase the amount of gameplay the player may find and build keys to access lost and forgotten parts of the solar system bosses each boss is different and will require teamwork and coordination to defeat earlygame bosses require brute force to eliminate but bosses from midgame and on require tactical movement and attacks in order to be defeated assassians as you have taken from the world the world will take from you upset a faction or a dark angry tenno whose lore is unknown and you may find yourself killed or maybe even captured by extremely dangerous assassians as the lights blink as if slenderman were there remember that your actions have consequences gamemodes the game includes gamemods such as extermination sabotage capture rescue spy intelligence gathering and so much more the games revolves around pve but a poor pvp system called conclave has been implemented clans the implementation of clans in this game is unique in the clan dojo players may research into each of the enemy factions technology and create weapons and devices out of them to use for themselves in combat graphics excellent but rather taxing on the computer even on lower video settings now onto your questions qwill this game run on my lowend computer aim sorry it probably wont but it wouldnt hurt to find out yourself qi hate pay to win games athat wasnt even a question however this is one of the most fair games i have ever played 97% of content in this game can be unlocked free of charge the cash currency known as platinum is rather used as a trading currency used to trade with other players free to play players could easily earn themselves 20 platinum or so in the trade market if they tried which is about $125 very few players spend platinum in the game market this is a complete list of platinumexclusive items color palettes to customize the look of your warframe weapons and sentinel and extra inventory space so that you can have more guns and warframes without having to sell old ones other than that theres nothing that a paying player can have access to that a free player cant qwill i have to grind for resourcesparts of a warframe or weapon ayes but warframes only have 3 parts whose bluepints drop from bosses all with an equal chance of dropping and 1 part will always drop this also applies to weapon parts from bosses resources are relatively easy to farm and you will find yourself loaded with all but the rare resources by midgame qare weapons balanced aim afraid not weapons are usually categorized into 3 tiers by players and tier 3 weapons will absolutely crush tier 1 weapons but almost no one plays the broken pvp in this game summary when i speak highly of this game i mean it this is a beautifully made game and i definitely suggest that you should give it a whirl stop reading this and install the game

is good but not very
recommended
this games has swords swords are cool and stuff so yeah get this game if you want to i really dont care either way
recommended
it has swords nothing else to say about this have other than that its awesome although it is a free to play game its not pay to win the vast majority of items in game you can get without spending a cent or a penny in real life it just takes a little time and determination exceptions are ofcourse items that make your warframe look better and colors if you play it youll see it is worth at least a try and if you get hooked on it dont blame me d its certainly not a game for all but for those that like melee weapons this game is for you
recommended
my favorite free to play game third person run and coop and shooty stuff excellent controls lots of free form wall running and ledge climbing built right in seamlessly

imo imo imo imo imo imo imo imo imo imo imo imo imo imo imo warframe is a thirdperson hack&slash game developed by digital extremes it features combat which easily master throws a twist of interesting game play warframe is great when handling lore people that lore such as myself will love warframes background story game play is broken into parts first the casual attimes boring missions these tedious missions are to grind for credits ingame currency and other materials to build weapons and warframes warframes true prime is shown in high level defence or survival this is the bread and butter of warframe challenging in either the sheer output of the enemies or the tactical play of your oxygen supplies or defence positioning warframes absolute best attribute its strong community scene and a strong relation with the developers such as steve scott and rebecca to name a few consistent bug content and other updatespatches with weekly live streams with fourfive lead developers talking about warframe and the upcoming updates and ideas taking question all live on twitch warframes payment system runs by something called platinum or plat for short weapons range in prices but very few weapons are locked be hide a pay wall warframes are also in the same handled similar so are sentinels warframe has a trading system many player trade platinum that they traded for or bought for ingames items not available on the market such as specific mods these can then be traded with the use a trading post which you must be in a clan which has built one otherwise you will have to be invited to their dojo to trade however a lack of a dedicated websites to host trading and deals such as team fortress 2s outpost leaves warframe player to scream into chat most are forgotten as the trade moves at an alarming rate ah whole systems such as team fortress 2s outpost should be implemented into the warframe site or a 3rd party developer should invest time into making one warframe is a game which caters to new and veteran players alike bring a fun but extremely casual game play experience to the table the lack of interesting game play innovations is warframe glaring downfall this severely limits the replayability for extensive play sessions undoubtable an amazing concept to a devolvement team that have proven themselves more than just avid programmers thank you very much to digital extremes for making warframe thank you very much for reading my full review of warframe

gorgeous paints for your character

this game i so amazing it does require a lot of skill but it is so fun especially with friends and i highly recomend you get it
recommended
all you need to know about warframe is that you can slice enemies to small chunks make a clan citadel 90% of the things people pay for are obtainable via gameplay and that its in space ninjas in space gun wielding ninjas space plus some levels look like big business buildings so you can imagine your slicing your way through apple employees and stoping world domination

this is one of the best things that ever happened in my life this is a great game if you have a friend or playing solo it has a great coop system and xp system at first i thought wow this is a pay to win game but its not you should give this a game a try and this is why i give it a 5
recommended
this is game is surprising for a f2p the graphics are just amazingi thought this would turn out to be a p2w but it has 0 aspects of thatone of the best games ive every played 1010

honestly one of the best free to play games out there sure you can pay to win but you dont have to which is great
recommended
very interesting for a free2play game nice short history plot even if its still in development really fun to play and you have a huge variation of character and you can build the one is suitable for your game style even if it still has a few bugs and problems i love the game 910
recommended
it gud game kind glichy tho
recommended
its fun and all can get a little repetitive when you have to grind insanely for something but its need for grinding is what makes it fun you have to spend time into this game you cant just leap into the highest level in a short time everything has build timers and as i said the grinding can be insane i recommend this game if you have alot of time to spend or if you simply want to have some fun with friends granted the game has its occaisional glitch and internet connectivity issues but its still a fun game to play

this is the best game love it just keep your wallet locked up and youll be fine

this game is brilliant
recommended
awesome game almost 1k of in game active hours of game and still going stronk if youre a newcommer dont let yourself get frustrated by the early game ask questions in chat most of the community is friendly and understanding major updates every month or so with weapons added even more often just dont download it if youre in college it will kill your study
recommended
best coop game i ever played
recommended
1010 i love this game its more suited to play with friends but you can play solo if you want to there are also clans you can join and have your very own dojo with the newer updates its a bit harder but everyone likes a challenge right
recommended
the most boredless game d
recommended
the story is terrible the graphics are good but not anything special the gameplay is repetetive and requires a lot of grinding to get anywhere however for some reason its my favourite game and i find it completely addictive it might be the space ninja robots it might the super fun movement system or vast array of weapons and characters im not sure but i love it 910
recommended
this game is really good and not good good but so good it will explode your brain dont take it too literally tho its about you a tenno which will stand up and kill everyone well not everyone but most of the enemies including the grineer so this game is just a freerun run&gun magic game interesting bossfights and newplayer friendly which is always good it gives you the freedom of crafting your own gun hence you got the blueprint and the required materials which are sometimes hard to find but sometimes as simple of killing everyone and farming the crap out of it d the gameplay is hard to master in my opinion as in the beginning even if its newplayer friendly the running and shooting mechanics can be hard to master but if you just put some time in it sadly i dont really have that much time for it because of real life stuff it will get easier its beautiful with great graphich and even a lowend pc can run it on low settings overall a great game still some room for improvement on some parts of it but for the most of it its an amazing game worth the shot to play

very fun and great game  recommended

a great scifi tps coop alien ninjas you heard it alien ninjas game thingy aliens yeah so as i said it is a very very fun game with very friendly players youtubers and devs very cool events and weapons there are a lot of weapons in this game and some of them arent the ones youre thinking about it is free and has the best graphics for a f2p game i came across yes it do need to watch some vids bout this game to get the hang of it and if you are going to play this game and invest a lot of time into it you pretty much have to spend money on it unless you found some rare stuff which you can trade for platinum which is the real money of this game and of course lets not forget the awful amount of farming but worth it if you do decide to play this game please add me ingame my name is of course meowhamster7 ill invite you to a very nice clan and just help you overall see ya in yo fancy warframes
recommended
the new updates are just making a good game even better
recommended
ive been a member of this community from when it started and i can say that is one of the greatest ive seenand that is given by the fact that the developers are in a really close relation with the players and they give them what they want and morelike they said the company is in the players hand when i first saw the teaser to the game i knew it would be successful and i dont regret a single hour spent playing this gamethe gameplay its amazing and its designed by youyour choice of warframes and weapons build your experienceyou can definately find a warframe of your taste but my proposal to everyone is to try them all because every single one of them offer a different experience sometimes it can get repetitive because you will need to farm for resources but get 3 more friends to play with and you wont even notice the time flying
recommended
when i first started playing this game a couple of months ago i was definitly confused with the mechanics the mission menu almost everything basically except the gameplay itself i ended up learning how to do the things that were initially only understable if you tinkered around self teach yourself how it all wokrs but with one of the updates that make the mission menu simpler to follow a more comprehendable control tutorial and most of all it teaches you what you need to do outside of the game that i only knew when i self taught it or looked on wikipedia this game is coming along nicely only thing id ever have to complain about to this point is the play to win catch i feel inferior playing against those who buy crazy armor and weapons or even the simplest designs but thats not really something that makes me hate this game i love it

fast paced third person hacknslashshooter not your everyday freetoplay hack and slash game different warframes to choose and unlock depending on how you like to get down plenty of upgrades and mods you can apply to your weapon or frame to match your playstyle space ninjas space nazis recommending it

warframe is a brilliant style and in its unusualness it creates nice and smooth gameplay it is always bieng updated so it always feels new the only propblem is sometimes when you go in a random group people will refuse to help but this does not happen to much once you reach the later levels

incredibly fun like a mix space and ninjas dare i say space ninjas you are the tenno a race of organisms that have been in cryosleep for a long time when the factions of the grinneer the corpus and the infested start to overtake the solar system and its outlying planets the tenno have been awakened by the lotus the mainframe for tenno communication and status to stop them in their tracks for a free to play game unlike many that have tons of microtransactions this game has 0% of pay to win all items in this game can be acquired through effort and playtime and yes some grinding it has a fun playstyle and its playerbase is incredibly helpful and supportive of new players its environment gets slightly boring in a short time but you get a small respite in certain planets like earth along with void missions derelict missions nightmare mode and invasionsalerts this game definitely has replayability if you are a player who loves getting achievements and 100% a game then this game will not be for you unless you have the apt amount of time to give it it does take a long time to get certain things and some of the items you get are completely random to the point where you will need other player help but based on the solo difficulty the game was obviously never meant to be played 100% solo

iss aight

this is one of the best games ever the best part is its free
recommended
bery pun and addictingif you like having pun and playing as space ninjas then this is the game for youand its free except the platinum guns melee weapons and such but dont worry the weapons areumm very cheap you may even be loki enough to get half off platinum as login rewards but its an exciting and an adventurous game just dont be annoying to others play nice and have fun by pressing switch teleport constantly thats the best way to just do it or nikethat too warframe can be a little squishy at first but after a bit of practice and ranking it will get easier i reccomend being loki using mk1 bratton for gun its the best to weapon to go for ecspeciall when you add ammo drum to it you will be invisible remember say no to drugs kids and whatever you dopress  alt f4  during your game when your hosting its a cheat that turns you into rage mode

very very addicting game lot of fun cyber space ninjas ftw

great game lots and lots of fun with your friends only negative side i found about this game is the repetitive missions you are going to be doing same things over and over again just on another place but still they change something and game is still pretty new so take that in mind updates are going to come out so be sure to check this game out
recommended
great fun slick and smooth really comes into its own after a few hours play as you can get into customising your warframes and weapons and by then youll have some idea how to go about setting up your frame and weapon modifications metacritic scores dont do this game justice  they were all given out by reviews made when the game was in early beta it was pretty good then its better now top quality alien shooter action the criticism i hear levelled at this game time and again is that its not completely free to play you do need to put a little bit of money into it for slots for new weapons and warframes and probably for items called orokin reactors which increase how many modifications you can load into your setup in addition to this while it is possible to get pretty much anything in the game through playing it you have to repeat the same mission ad nauseum if you want to get all of the components for one warframe or item right away i think a number of people who are giving it the highest praise are the people willing to drop some real dollar into the game to purchase items from time to time in this way and if youre a collector you could easily spend a great deal of cash nevertheless the core gameplay is slick itll cost you nothing to play it perfectly adequately for a few days and it has throatsinging in its soundtrack try it its free

one of the two best games currently on the f2p circuit both of which happen to be selfpublished digital extremes is a group that cares deeply about its player base involves and keeps them updated with all aspects of development and responds promptly to critical emergencies theyre working very hard at making a pveexclusive tps in the vast sea of pvp domination no matter how you view the project at its various stages you have to give them immense credit for going full throttle at this nothing but applause edit should note that at the time of this op the game did not have the clan dojo dueling room or the conclaves nevertheless focus on pvp modes has remained a secondary priority for digital extremes and they are still standing fast behind their commitment to pve

its stuffed with sexy and free

the gameplay is quick fun and solid there isnt many inbalances in the combat going to a higher level area means you will die pretty straight forward while the parkour feels a bit forced sometimes with how your character will snap into a sequence of moves which launches you off a cliff it works well when its done intentionally i usually loathe coop games i prefer single player and this game does allow solo play which ramps down the enemies in number and skill i love that there are missions that require coop play and turning the game to a public match is one button lovely it feels a lot more refined a coop experience than most as an f2p game i have to talk about p2w there is none a lot of games claim to have p2w and dont p2w by some is that this game allows quick advancement thats not pay2win you can access everything except cosmetics in game for free it may take longer to get but you can get it free stuff is reasonably priced and sometimes you can get 255075% discounts on premium currency platinum as a daily reward among lots of other things which its then recommended you wait until you get a discount to buy any dosh there are things like how many weapons you can have at once and how many warframes you can have at once this is all increased with platinum did i mention a new account grants you 50 platinum which you can use on cosmetics or slots or daily revives yeah thats there my only complaint is the raw time you have to invest you can only rank up once a day which is frustrating but i guess it keeps people from advancing faster than others understandable but when if you fail a rank up test you have to wait 24 hours is rediculous id understand 412 hours but not a whole day crafting is out of the picture for the most part for the first few days of existance you will not be able to aquire the parts to craft even lower end gear until you get further into the game which you cant do because your gear is bad so youre relying on the luck of the drop to get enough mods to make your low end gear not suck again i understand they dont want accellerated advancements new gear though doesnt mean better with the exception of prime variants your weapon starts at lvl 0 and goes up to 30 which allows you to mod it further along that track it doesnt really take long to get something to lvl 30 a weapon if used a lot can get to lvl 30 in a days worth of hardcore playing recommended yes gg

warframe is a brilliant game many alternative fighting styles and so many mods and items try not to put money into this game get in good with high level characters and forge your playing style and the prices of platinum are a ripoff warning do not play this game because of the current update since it stops all game use for windows 8 and up users
recommended
game is very addicting downloaded it on a whim from a friend who played the game occasionally was slow to start but now i have spent over 90 hours and counting in it there is a lot of grinding in it unless you want to drop some dough however the grinding is enjoyable and there is almost always someone to play with the enjoyable gameplay along with the constant updates and additions make this one of my favorite f2p games of all time and i dont feel pressured to drop a lot of money on it even though i will occasionally make a purchase here or there 910

i really really enjoy warframe combat wise if youve ever played the multiplayer maps in mass effect 3 it is very similar if you enjoy being able to customize your characters look and abilties youll very much enjoy this game the developers are also constantly pushing out new updates that have a fair amount of contentimprovements to the game now the game is still technically in open beta and while most professional reviewers have pointed that out their reviews are also from fairly early public builds of the game a lot has changed in the past 5 updates or so i really think the game needs to be revisited the game can be challenging or you can stride through battle slaughtering countless foes as easily as chewing gum the choice is up to you various game modes and varying difficulties can all be chosen by the player while the game is free to play and you can earn in game credits to buy and build new and more powerful gear throwing the developers som cash can help speed the process a bit plus i think the devs deserve just a bit for producing something that has given me so many hours of enjoyment easily taking hours away from my beloved wife sorry honey so give this game a go if youre looking for beautiful graphics fun fast paced combat and an ever evolving game you wont be disappointed suit up tenno war is calling

the decision to play this game is to give up on reality bugs glitches horrible pubbies and the nosiest lady in the world will be the order of the day that does not automatically mean that this game is bad because it absolutely isnt for a f2p game this is the one i had the most fun with all the weapons and warframes can be bought in the ingame store but can also be found while playing the only things that can not be found ingame are vanity items every update is a new adventure what will break next will the ui break again or will the loot table be topsy turvy again who knows try it out play untill you atleast get a different warframe other than the starter ones and you will be alright

this game is amazing it has a super long campaign and tons of customization options the only downside is having to use real money for stuff but you can unlock it through cards yet it takes a lot of farming

i really like warframe like really i love being loki and i love sprinting around at the speed of sound heres where warframe sucks theres nothing to do at least there used to be now theres conclave where you can pvp 2v2 i havent tried it yet apparantly it might be fun but really theres not much to spend credits on unless you like grinding for other warframes but what if you already like the warframe you have what do i sink creds into then consumables [yea rite] warframe suffers from being a free to play forevergame it needs a campaign with a plotline that you can follow and play along with not just complete the solar system  do alarts

my favorite free to play game third person run and coop and shooty stuff excellent controls lots of free form wall running and ledge climbing built right in seamlessly

quite a fun game from the start i highly recomend that you get this free to play game right now trust me its the best
recommended
cool game but i like beta more
recommended
just 4 word this game is awesome 
recommended
roughtly this game is metroid meets team fortress 2 but actually in a deeper sense or actually in my disturbed mind the tennos are the metaphor for the perfect society the grineers are the metaphor of the communists the corpus are the metaphor of the capitalists the infected are the metaphor of the anarchists and the corrupted are probably some revoluting people that join force from everywhere across the world twisted logic
recommended
lets see warframe its a scifi game with exosuits spaceninjas fighting the ugly bad guys well you can basiclly buy almost anything in the cash shop including cosmetics this game is immensly fun with friends and trying out the amazing weapons there are katanas whips laser guns shotguns freeze rays and many more now the maps are the same and can feel repetitve because it is although some of the levels look really cool well compared to the other maps now the gameplay could range to really boring to really fun that depends on what weapons you using and how you use them now the warframes are the exosuits the players can wear it gives them special powers like jumping high iron skin healing and mind control getting warframes can be very difficult and that brings me to my next point the learning curv is very steep so you need to watch youtube videos on how to play properly thes game is also very difficult so if you like that then good so in the end do i recommend this game well if you like what youve seen here then go play this if this turnes you off then you can try it i guess so i personally enjoyed this game immensly but i didnt let that get in the way of the recommendation of this game this review is just my opinion
recommended
review may be subject to changes as the games still in beta  no paywalls a very important thing in a f2p game  the games fun  fluid combat and movement  good graphics  lots of weapons to choose from  the entire game is a grindfest the only goal in this game is to increase your mastery rank and get more weapons to grind with amazing  no dedicated servers with high bandwidth and pc performance requirements for hosting this turns most public games into unenjoyable lagfests  ridiculous cash shop prices on warframes and weaponry  major balance issues with all equipment in the game especially with new weapon releases which essentially is power creep  no variety  no real difficulty most of it is just artificial difficulty with stat increases  community lacks brain cells  terrible pvp yes pvp is just a thing that was added because everyone asked for it and its definitely not the focus of the game but that doesnt mean i cant criticize it  nonexistent ai  no endgame content warframe has had a lot of potential which it showed back in early open beta however the game has taken a turn for the worse with more and more grinding and power creep put into it its a fun game to play at first but as you progress and increase your mastery rank you will notice that the only thing youre doing is grinding your  off 75100

pretty slow at start but if you enjoy third person shooters it gets better after 23 hours of gameplay there is loads of weapons and warframes to use and you can get all of them without paying a single dime to do so however requires quite a bit if patience since you have to grindfarm for ingredients and wait through a 12 hour timewall in order to craft anything if you dont mind farming for loads of stuff and waiting through timewalls or are prepared to put real money in it the game does manage to make you feel quite badass indeed on another note the community is friendly as hell

nice game its had a lot of good updates it has been improved greatly if you played it when it first came out and didnt like it try it again you might find you like it so much more stuff

great game play it its free

warframe is a cooperative freetoplay scifi shooter game developed by digital extremes de for the pc and playstation 4 it is set in a distant future where the solar system is torn between a hypermilitarist clone empire profitdriven technological merchants and infested mutantszombies the player takes the role of a tenno a member of a fourth faction with a blurry past and roots in ninja themes and is guided by an entity called the lotus through missions including timed survival prisoner rescue sabotage and many more the players is always pitted against enemies in superior numbers to this end players have at their disposal a varied arsenal of weapons both archaic and fantastic and most notably a special suit of armor called the warframe each of which has a particular set of abilities despite being primarily a shooter game the gameplay has a definite focus on the agility of the warframes featuring some parkour elements and the way each warframes abilities allow for creativity in combat to sum it up this is a very good game

i love this game this game is awsome

1610 stars would play this game is without a doubt the f2p mmo of its type mixing the parkour runandgun physics of gunz the duel and gunz the second duel with the scifi setting that dark sector laid the groundwork for this game has become a direct successor to the hit title play the game as one of 15 and counting warframes and dozens of weapons through runandgun style or even stealth style missions of varying difficulty levels and types pure killing extermination stealthy assaults capture and sabotage missions want to just test your mettle endless defense assassination and even survival mode where your life support is constantly draining making you weaker the farther you go this game has become an amazing game and was even recently named best free to play game in the market by contest on mmobomb if youve got a mediumspec pc you can pm me for details on this if needed or even if youre an enthusiast gamer with no money for subscriptions this game is for you the devs care about the population and while prices are steep for platinum ingame reallife currency to discourage a pay 2 win mentality theyre still fair theres even pvp once you reach rank 30 the current maximum for your warframe warframe and player levels are not computed as one tldr great game you will never find me saying something bad about it black rose gaming
recommended
i just got in my mind this game is nice but the problem is grind and a bit of p2w ill play it again though c
recommended
did you really believe it would be that easy
recommended
great leveling system nice combat and movement tho a little repetitive
recommended
play it for christs sake
recommended
warframe is fun but to enjoy it completely you will have to put in a few bucks
recommended
this game is so awesome
recommended
shld i download it yea u should pretty amazing game <3
recommended
for a 3rd person innovated and well designed worth a try
recommended
this is a sexy 3rd person future ninja type of shooter it is fast paced and requires skill and teamwork the multiplayer workes well a system of constant upgrades weapons and abilitiess along with steam rewards make it worthwile and keeps you wanting more not the smoothest platform but i think they will continue to work out the kinks definetly a killer free game highly recommended _desperado
recommended
omg i played this in closed beta and it was so repitative and didnt really take the time to figure out what was going on i was told to check it out again i dl the new 115 and i am now totally addicted to it the missions make it fun the online play is quick to match up the vote for mission is sweet the clan dojo has totally sealed the deal i am loving it
recommended
do i recommend this game yes absolutely  its free  and this is the best free onlinegame i have ever played by far  why up to 4 players against different kind of enemies in different landscapes and situations it has elements of cardgames when modding the weapons like rpgelements the steering of the character is a challange at first but based on the speed when you got it its fun like a racinggame players who are more active are rewarded with higher levels in characters and weapons but those levels are limited at 30 so new players arent disadvanteged too much and are able to catch up soon everyone can get the character warframe and the weapons which fit best to their very personal fightingstyle there is a possibility to spend money but not needed at all asssasination defense extinction rescue and so on are just some of the levelobjectives in the 200something levels fast actions fast movements great teamtactics and a wellthought weapondamagesystem makes this game a great funtrip every time get into the universe and we might play together soon
recommended
very fun game with great movement abilities very addicting
recommended
i first tried out this game a long long time ago during the beta as a founder the money i spent for the founder pack is something i have yet to regret every new patch brings new features more diversity in the missions new frames and very often new zones even if it is free to play there is no need to spend a lot of money on this game im still running on my original founders platinum which ive mostly used to buy more slots for my warframeweapons as well as a few cosmetic itemsthe crafting is very well done and offers a wide range of possibilities and a good alternative to spending platinum to buy gear and frames for casual players with only a few hours to invest in a game you can have fun with this only playing a few hours a week for the more hardcore players you can spend an easy 200 hours probably more to get everything and upgrade everything the major downside of this game is the social aspect unlike other arpgs the fast paste gameplay makes it harder to socialize than in other arpgs the clan system is pretty nice and the general chat offers good alternative for socialising but as a whole i feel the game is not quite there yet and i am convinced they are working on improving that aspect somehow the game devs are really there with the community and participate in eventsinteract with the players a lot its really fun to see so much enthusiasm in todays gaming world all in all ill start playing the game and tell myself just a few runs ill only be on for an hour or so but then i spend 34 hours running stuff and realise that well its 5 am and i should probably go to bed because i have work in 3 hours s as a founder i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys arpgs crafting farming and participating in event
recommended
nonsense game  why pay so much stuff for virtual crap

recommended
love this game and if anyone wants to play with me join meh clan now dammit
recommended
great game requiring skills which are easily developed once played for hours although pvps system sucks the overall game is just magnificent
recommended
the concept of the game is cool graphics are nice playing with friends is good and all but it gets tiring quickly due to its lack of variety in stages enemies modes etc etc if you are looking for a game to stick with this is not for you however the game is free so its fun to just jump in and play with friends once in a while
recommended
try it out its great
recommended
decent game fun if you want to just waste time
recommended
its ninjas in space what else do you need
recommended
note i played this game while drunk and writing this review drunkopinions expressed by druken vampiricpadraig may not reflect the actual opinions of sobar vampiricpadraig and thus should be taken with a grain of salt ui awesome gameplay awesome the wave thingyeah the first thing kinda awesome but dont expect to stay alive after wave 6 when you can choose to leave overall i give this a 910 cons get rid of the platinum system and we are good

join us on an odyssey of front flips and jump kicks across the solar system

warframe is one of the best games ive played in a long timei its requires you to use strategic gameplay and parkour methods to survive in most situations making the game estatic and addictive althought the game is in beta i belive it will be 1 on lots of gammers lists
recommended
really good for a free game but updates take along time even after you acualy get the game
recommended
amazing the time i have spent is evident of that the movement system is awesome
recommended
greatest game on steam ive found
recommended
do you like ninjas how about space ninjas would you like to become a space ninja and kill everyone that hates space ninjas if you answer yes to the questions above get this game if you do you will become a space ninja travel across the galaxy murder anything and anyone who isnt a space ninja make some weapons level up said weapons parkour parkour to hard and over shoot where you wanted to go fall off the level get placed where you started parkouring tame a space dog murder some bosses have the bosses send you hate mail have the bosses call a space ninja to come murder you sees the space ninja dies insert any swear word here rinse repeat so sprintslidemelee your way to victory
recommended
i started playing on friday by the time i went to sleep on sunday i had 50 hours played so yea theres that
recommended
pretty fun and exciting game lots of weapons and characters there are many things you can do in this game for example you can run on walls do backflips or slide down ramps you like to get upclose and personal you can grab a shoty or hold f to equip melee and kamiakzee the enemies dont like to get close keep the distance with rifles each warframe has different abilitiesplaystyles you get 3 weapons a primary a side arm and a melee weapon you can either go in guns blazing or stealth missions if you likepatience is required the pve is what shines the brightest in this game though the ai can be a bit questionable they are still competent and offer a challenge to the player in pve you can play up to 4 players and 4 players in pvp or you can solo now here are some minor problems with the game sometimes games can get very lagy making everyone warp around stealth is very hard for the wrong reasons enemies can sometimes spot you via sixth sense or can sometimes derp right infront of you many maps are usualy close quarters meaning sniping and stealthing can be very difficult which i recommend only if you have reached end game or need a challenge im not a fan of pvp and i dont play it but i did try it in its early stages i dont know if they changed pvp but damage mods really ruin pvp as some one who doesnt have them is going to get stomped and turns the game into a call of duty with ninjas overall good game but it can get a bit repetitive with all the grinding expresources which is reasonable because this is a free to play the bleed mechanic can get quite annoying since it goes through shields and is based on rng 3 factions each and have their own environments bosses are pretty meh except lephantis which was very satisfying to fight buying platinum sure helps lessen the grinding which is good so if you dont like to grind recommend buying some platinum
recommended
im not very good at posting comments but meh just give it a helpful review>>> warframe is very awesome for a ninja play sifi and a third person veiw lol>  i can picture if its first person but that prob decrease xp of you playing it making a warframe tip it will prob take a long time to makea lot money to spend and a lot time to collect but i think that way is more effective than just wasting your real money to buy plitanium well its a very> very> very awesome game and i give it a 1010 i will prob update this review again if i want to and shred some darkness into the light

warframe takes place many centuries after modernday civilization today after the events of dark sector the game is a coop 14 player thirdperson shooter with many different features such as weapon customization physx support great graphics amazing movement capabilities with very simple controls large variety of enemies and bosses clans and over a hundred different weapons and playable warframes my favorite part however is the lore the game has the most amazing lore i have ever seen in a game it is so very extensive shrouded with wars and mystery much of the history of warframe was lost with memory loss and time but from the known lore the history of the game is amazing even with very little info known the only bad thing about this game is that things in the shop are overpriced and hard to obtain without spending money but by far this is the best damn shooter i have ever played if you want to learn more of the lore get dark sector in the steam catalog i couldnt recommend this game any more even if i tried i pity the people who lose the experiences of this game by not playing it
recommended
imagine taking assasains creed taking out all the plot then making that an fps set in space also you can upgrade upgrades that upgrade upgrades
recommended
this is an awesome game and i really suggest you download this game get this game the guys did a really really good job of this game so thanks to those guys d
recommended
how to start well warframe is an actionfpshack n slash game so addictive at the beginning you will be surprised of the amazing and funny gameplay and method to obtain the stuff its easy its attractive its fast its cooperative etc you will be interested in being more powerfull with better modsweaponswarframes etc later you will have a feel that its a bit repetitive the gameplay then the absence of a decent vs multiplayer mode like capture the flag deathmatch control points king of the hill etc will make you feel a void in your soul then you will feel a lil disappointed when you realize wf in some cases is too p2w and etc etc afterall seeing that wf is still on develop you will say that is not that bad when you have your mates there its an amazing game to play and always it will make you go deep on it and having you playing more and more obtaining what you want to obtain because its true you can obtain the 90% of the stuff without pay certainly slots system is a bit abusive and with all of this in mind you will say ok lets try again to see if the boss finally drop the blueprint  and you will repeat this again and again 910
recommended
its a good game but it really sucks
recommended
damn good for a free to play one of the best ive ever encountered the start is a bit rough but once you get the flow of it it becames super fun the combat and weapon system is really unique and the movement is unlike any other game ive played before downsides are it gets a bit grindy but the way they implimented the game it works out well you rank up by using more guns and increasing your skill with them no weapons are off limits to people who dont want to dump real money into it but your pool of weapons and frames will be limited even then there are events and promotions that give weapons you can just delete and keep the open slot a really fun and interesting game the best part is the developers are very active and quick about hearing the communitys word and take a great deal of care into making sure the feedback they get doesnt fall on deaf ears
recommended
pretty damn fun definitly need friends to play with to make the most out of it though
recommended
edited i decided to come back and try this again and after the hump that was the first rank enjoyed it a lot more without spending a dime keeping up with paid players and the levels are quite a bit of fun
recommended
i was very skepickal about this game till i played it with friends and had so much fun ill be playing it for a long time  great graphics and gameplay cant wait to see how this game evolves
recommended
robo ninjas are a nice touch 77 would sell my body for
recommended
awesome game with friends graphics amazing special affects make it seem its coming out of a science fiction movie
recommended
a lot of fun with friends good payment system 160 hours and i only spent $20 with plat to spare it can be repetitive but its fun its one of the few games where ive enjoyed the grind it kept me interested and i was happy to work towards new warframes and weapons once i got all the weapons and warframes i wanted though i did stop playing there wasnt anything end game to keep me going but if you got friends to play with its a good time
recommended
this game is really amazing it has good graphics and it play really great
recommended
fun late night game
recommended
game is amazing that is all
recommended
absolutely amazing and well done love it <3 3
recommended
space ninjas play for free free to play defines this game extremely well the fact that most ftp games are pay to win this game is the exact opposite this game is play to win sure you can spend money and buy things but you can literally unlock everything except for colors slots and aesthetic features in game there are items in game that you have to play to unlock you cant buy everything the play style of warframe is amazing its pve with groups of four sure you can run solo but its a lot more fun to play with groups the beginning is somewhat slow but once you hit around the third planet and you figure everything out this game is simply amazing the graphics are breathtaking i could go very indepth about this game but ill let you decide if you enjoy it or not just think about this one phrase spaceninjas
recommended
who dose not want to play as a space ninja killing creepy looking bad guys oh you well go away then
recommended
warframe review this game can be very fun i personally give it an 810 and i believe its pretty damn good advantages  has great graphics better than alot of games out there  has interesting factions and interesting weapons and grineerish is just pure awesome  most of the game can be accessed for free by crafting or as login rewards  the whole solar system is free and can be done with any warframe  every warframe and weapon have advanteges and disadvantages this makes them fairly well ballanced  the game is free to play disadvantages  some items cannot be aquired for free they must be bought for platinum  the game has microtransactions which is never a good sign but they dont give any overpowered items  colors are not free palletes cost 75 platinum each along with most cosmetic items  platinum is very hard to get without paying money  ridiculous crafting times starting at 12 hours to 72 hours overall i think this game is worth a shot i have been playing for almost a year now since the early beta if you are willing to pay real world money for platinum i recommend waiting until you get a discount as a login reward i also highly recommend doing research on the wiki before craftinbuying items happy hunting tenno  crazy
recommended
i have spent so much time in this game it is so much fun and really feels rewarding
recommended
super fun game but its quite an odd concept ever wondered how weird baseball is to someone whos never played it that idea is a lot like this cool game though
recommended
warframe is a cooperative online third person free to play action game presenting wonderful gameplay graphics quality and action involving space ninjabotsthis game is currently in beta but it is generally a ps4 gameit is becoming more wonderful game on steam with every updates and it is an addictive gameso i will recommend this game to every player on steam 
recommended
for those who hate tps and scifi this game will make you love itits a must play game everyone will love it good fanservice as well o oppai everwhere

i played it on the ps4 and the pc why cant i stop playing
recommended
didnt even know this was on steam 1010
recommended
i like it a lot thats all
recommended
its free and fun get it
recommended
so far logged at least 300hrs into this game what can i say totally friggin sweet losts of action fast paced and rarely a dull moment play with a team go in loud or stealth or do things solo either way its a lot of fun still in a beta even though its been a year so things will change as content is improved and added on best part if there is a problem of or an issue after a patch the dev team hops right to it and releases a fix within minutes so far its brilliant well designed and for a free to play it kicks  granted not much to a storyline yet but it will get there in this your an interstellar ninja what more could you possibly ask for and if you dont like it well perhaps you need to try playing a bit diffrently download check it out and enjoy
recommended
really fun and graphic are amazing
recommended
amazingly fun consistently interesting looks and feels fantastic at the same time not for everyone its the sort of game where you will need to change to progress without the gameplay changing simultaneously it does require a great deal of farming to get around paying for the cool stuff if youre the kind of person who enjoys taking on the same challenges from different angles and in different ways warframe is the best game possible for you the multiplayer is great allowing you to have a ton of fun with your friends
recommended
this game is not free 
recommended
seriously the best free to play game ever
recommended
great game to play with friends very diverse character builds and awesome animation
recommended
this game is massive amounts of fun many unique and familiar art styles blend seamlessly and are seperate enough in their theme so players can recognize different factions with ease the crafting system will not appeal to casualgamers so much but dedication is well rewarded
recommended
fun as hell
recommended
i played this before the big update i had the time of my life but after the update it became laggy and confusing
recommended
a brilliant game fun to play and it keeps you coming back not p2w at all

its a very good game

great game awesome graphics  good story line the game moves at the pace you want it and the game will teach you the basics of how to play the game youll get easily caught up playing with friends for hours at a time 1010 score from me
recommended
ninja aliens this game made my day 
recommended
this game is amazing have played for a while and will continue to play every update brings new fresh content in a unique style of play not found in any other game the one problem is learning to play the game the tutorial could use some inprovement but aside from that the game is flawless 1010 side note if you are struggling to learn something there is a lot of support provided on the games forums and within the game in various different chat channels
recommended
this game has everything that a person wants fricken ninjas in space dogs killing people swords guns badass warframes and for the guys sexualize warframes that will probably give them rageboners im just saying
recommended
so here is the deal warframe is aweful honestly 010 would not play maybe maybe 210 cuz swords other than that this game is lame you force yourself to play a few hours however becuase it has gotten higher ratings than some of your favorite games so youre in around ten hours and you get to your first level 30 weapon you have since then purchased andor found other weapon parts and intended to build a superior weapon to the weapon you currently have you give it a shot and holy dear lord is it good and it felt pretty satisfying coming out of the 12 or 24 hour oven foundry so you play with that for a while and have a decent amount of fun so okay games not great maybe a 510 at least its free but becuase this new weapon is pretty good you want to see what else is on the horizon rinse and repeat until about 40 hours when you realize that youve covered most of the starchart and have a few good weapons rinse and repeat until you can take down anything in the starchart very fast rinse and repeat until you can take out the stalkler in one hit with a meelee weapon rinse and repeat until you can last to 45 mins  on t4 survival etc etc etc 1010 god tier game would recommend even dropping cash on teh game tldr graph of y  x where x is how much you play and y is your desire to play

its ninjas in space what else do you need

its a amazing and wonderful game full of action adventure and that splash of violence that just makes it great though in the first few days or months depending how much you play it is difficult mainly in money and resources but that will soon end and best of all you dont have to worry that much about upgrading since all warframes have unique abilities and traits to decide on so i would definitly recomend this game but for people who dont like 3rdperson view space travel guns lazers swords bows robots and ninjas turn your head and find a different game
recommended
grinding and running simulator space ninjas with energy guns so much hate with laggs and crushes with weak notebook why love this game qooo

 story  they were called tenno warriors of blade and gun masters of the warframe armor those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins now they are needed once more the grineer with their vast armies are spreading throughout the solar system a call echoes across the stars summoning the tenno to an ancient place they summon you allow the lotus to guide you she has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive the grineer will find you you must be prepared the lotus will teach you the ways of the warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers come tenno you must join the war i think in my opinion is one of the best f2p games i ever playedit has weapons space ninjas archwing character costumization santinels your very own pet called kubrow and more the best advice i can give you is take your time and dont buy everything you see on marketalmost everything you see there can be createdoptained through hard wark and patience i definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for this kind of gamesthats it now excusie me i need to get back and save the humanity
recommended
want destiny play this instead save yourself $60
recommended
most graphicaly detailed mmo ive ever seen love the game play having a sword and bow in space is a fun new spin i found that the mouse sensitivety is more sensetive than a menstrating teenage girl who was just dumped on prom night even after i turned it down almost to zero this gives the illision of extreme lag which can  you off everything is also shaped weird as in enemies and such like there armor is plated over bursting tummours which have serverly deformed them but this keeps the game interestin and fresh runs pretty smoothly
recommended
game rocks d maybe the best ninja game ever
recommended
i heard this game was repetetive and even early on i can see how people say that but it looks like theres a lot of depth to it and its interesting enough im gonna keep playing for a while
recommended
warframe is the best game i played so far on steam  it has amazing graphich and the best gameplay that is evolveing every daybut it has repetiv ad that is its only downfallbut when you surpass that its amazingyou can chose betvine 100 weaponsfireing and meele and dosens of sutis with their uniq powers so log in and have fun
recommended
well after more than 400 hours of playing this on steam and another 200 of playing on their louncher i can say that the game got me though it gets repetitive if you can look over that and become part of the community youll never get bored of it
recommended
this game is the greatest its like halo assasins creed and destiny had a child and it was an mmorpg
recommended
i think this is the best game i have ever played i usally finsh a long game in a about 300 hours but this game i have nearly got 400 hours into it and im not even a quater way through it is a great game for users that like scifi third person shooters well you dont even have to be into scifi to play this game
recommended
brilliant co operative shooter many different classes not my type of game but hey i recommend it
recommended
play this game its awsome
recommended
i downloaded this game a long time ago but almost as soon as i got in the game i exited out and deleted it because the blur was just too much i see now that it looks a little better so i would try it out if i were you

1610 stars would play this game is without a doubt the f2p mmo of its type mixing the parkour runandgun physics of gunz the duel and gunz the second duel with the scifi setting that dark sector laid the groundwork for this game has become a direct successor to the hit title play the game as one of 15 and counting warframes and dozens of weapons through runandgun style or even stealth style missions of varying difficulty levels and types pure killing extermination stealthy assaults capture and sabotage missions want to just test your mettle endless defense assassination and even survival mode where your life support is constantly draining making you weaker the farther you go this game has become an amazing game and was even recently named best free to play game in the market by contest on mmobomb if youve got a mediumspec pc you can pm me for details on this if needed or even if youre an enthusiast gamer with no money for subscriptions this game is for you the devs care about the population and while prices are steep for platinum ingame reallife currency to discourage a pay 2 win mentality theyre still fair theres even pvp once you reach rank 30 the current maximum for your warframe warframe and player levels are not computed as one tldr great game you will never find me saying something bad about it black rose gaming

this game really ing hates your left pinky

this game is a thirdperson action shooter with lots of parkour upclose melee combat and plenty of powers and guns to keep each game going at a nice fast pace i will say this the game will require quite a bit of time before it really becomes truly enjoyable however recent updates have allowed players to get good loot fairly early to have an edge in battle and then allow the player to start working towards the more powerful items most weapons are fairly balanced except for most beginner weapons which are extremely weakdont pick up the lato and aklato and with the right amount of tweaking can be easily used for late game but some weapons were designed to go into much further late game play the community is probably one of the friendliest groups around as the game is more centered on pve than pvp and most players will be on the same playing field as you so never hesitate to ask questions and ask for help from others the game updates very frequently and is always handing out new content including weapons not dlc quests not dlc and enemies not dlc did i mention this game has no dlcs the only thing purchased with irl money is just for quick advantages at earning weapons and warframes that can be obtained in game with enough patience and some cosmetics as well but the game is very far from paytowin as anyone can get the same advantage as everyone else its just a matter if you want that advantage sooner so never feel like youre hardpressed to purchase something the only quirp i have against this game is that connection issues can sometimes be a hinderence either preventing you from joining or just outright ending the game when players join but if you have a fairly decent connection there isnt anything to worry about overall its a fun game that is still expanding with a good community i highly recommend this game besides its space ninjas how much more awesome can that get

hell i love this gamethe online campaign feature rocks

i have something to sayi am addicted to this game i dont know what it is because the game is a hell of a grind but i think its when i finally achieve what im trying to get the prime weapons and warframes the rare mods for weapons and warframes the awesome big updates once a month that add a load of new content the awesome communitythe awesome developersand of course i cant forget the new melee 20 system maybe thats what it is so addicting well all i can say is give it a go its free so no loss except for dl p and try it you may notice it is a big grind so to help you out use this link to sign up and get a 7 day level booster to help with getting better weapons becuase thats the only thing holding you back from getting the awesome weapons httpswarframecomsignupreferrerid516fa1c11a4d801222000000 have fun

warframe is so amazing <3<3
recommended
space war great on graphic but still have some glitch action for ninja
recommended
warframe is a very good game great looks and feel to the game easy to get the hang of it now before anyone starts yelling at me saying its a pay to win game ill say this oh sure you can pay to get almost everything in the game with real cash but with that said all it does is give it to you and make room for it for you you still need to go level it and learn to use it so not pay to win but pay to make it quicker yes for sure my only small con to the game is they added in tons of stuff that in my book should have been given to the players for free but they charge for it as well like colors to change you warframes looks to a better color youll need to pay for that or like me never do it so no worries the game is a grind you need to find frineds and run though mission over and over to get mods to become more powerful recommend this game oh sure its very fun and if you dont want to spend anything it is free who can beat free

recommended
how to start well warframe is an actionfpshack n slash game so addictive at the beginning you will be surprised of the amazing and funny gameplay and method to obtain the stuff its easy its attractive its fast its cooperative etc you will be interested in being more powerfull with better modsweaponswarframes etc later you will have a feel that its a bit repetitive the gameplay then the absence of a decent vs multiplayer mode like capture the flag deathmatch control points king of the hill etc will make you feel a void in your soul then you will feel a lil disappointed when you realize wf in some cases is too p2w and etc etc afterall seeing that wf is still on develop you will say that is not that bad when you have your mates there its an amazing game to play and always it will make you go deep on it and having you playing more and more obtaining what you want to obtain because its true you can obtain the 90% of the stuff without pay certainly slots system is a bit abusive and with all of this in mind you will say ok lets try again to see if the boss finally drop the blueprint  and you will repeat this again and again 910
recommended
pretty damn fun definitly need friends to play with to make the most out of it though
recommended
edited i decided to come back and try this again and after the hump that was the first rank enjoyed it a lot more without spending a dime keeping up with paid players and the levels are quite a bit of fun
recommended
you just have to play this game its pretty addictive and have space ninjas what else do you want well there is more infinite farming maps plenty of bosses plant of customization options if you like ninjas and stuff you just have to play it 
recommended
good game and its free

highly addicting game everything can be earned in game without spending money this is a true free to play game and i recommend this game to everyone come and become a tenno

recommended
its pretty good if you like grinding
recommended
you can do all the stuff in the trailer if you can do all the stuff in the trailer then that mean the game is awesome period plus you play as freaking space ninjas
recommended
lets see warframe its a scifi game with exosuits spaceninjas fighting the ugly bad guys well you can basiclly buy almost anything in the cash shop including cosmetics this game is immensly fun with friends and trying out the amazing weapons there are katanas whips laser guns shotguns freeze rays and many more now the maps are the same and can feel repetitve because it is although some of the levels look really cool well compared to the other maps now the gameplay could range to really boring to really fun that depends on what weapons you using and how you use them now the warframes are the exosuits the players can wear it gives them special powers like jumping high iron skin healing and mind control getting warframes can be very difficult and that brings me to my next point the learning curv is very steep so you need to watch youtube videos on how to play properly thes game is also very difficult so if you like that then good so in the end do i recommend this game well if you like what youve seen here then go play this if this turnes you off then you can try it i guess so i personally enjoyed this game immensly but i didnt let that get in the way of the recommendation of this game this review is just my opinion
recommended
review may be subject to changes as the games still in beta  no paywalls a very important thing in a f2p game  the games fun  fluid combat and movement  good graphics  lots of weapons to choose from  the entire game is a grindfest the only goal in this game is to increase your mastery rank and get more weapons to grind with amazing  no dedicated servers with high bandwidth and pc performance requirements for hosting this turns most public games into unenjoyable lagfests  ridiculous cash shop prices on warframes and weaponry  major balance issues with all equipment in the game especially with new weapon releases which essentially is power creep  no variety  no real difficulty most of it is just artificial difficulty with stat increases  community lacks brain cells  terrible pvp yes pvp is just a thing that was added because everyone asked for it and its definitely not the focus of the game but that doesnt mean i cant criticize it  nonexistent ai  no endgame content warframe has had a lot of potential which it showed back in early open beta however the game has taken a turn for the worse with more and more grinding and power creep put into it its a fun game to play at first but as you progress and increase your mastery rank you will notice that the only thing youre doing is grinding your  off 75100

theres a part in the game where you need to get a kubrow pet  dog kinda things and you need to kill them destroy their home take their egg and then hatch that egg until that kubrow becomes youre sex slave 1010 best game ever
recommended
dead space meets samuris with superpowers best in coop
recommended
one of the best graphics an online rpg can offer
recommended
awesome but should tell you more information and needs more story
recommended
for a free game its not too bad of course all the best stuff is bought with currency that can only be acquired by real money but eh you dont need it to play through the game pretty good game id say a 710
recommended
i played this game back when it was first released on steam and not much since then that being said i thouroughly enjoyed what the game had to offer back then and everytime i hop on to check whats new there is always tons of new stuff and while the game itself can get a little repetitive i feel its still enjoyable overall the melee weapon play is very fun and the gun play was pretty decent too the crafting system can turn into a grind but with friends it can still be a pleasant experience even while grinding
recommended
kill  with badass weapons then build more badass weapons to kill more  1210 plats a bit expensive tho obama approves this message
recommended
probably the best free to play game fps of all time its fast pretty and fun even the micro transactions system is very fair and they keep evolving the game in the right direction with constant updates highly recommended
recommended
while fun the game has three free classes to pick in the begining the other classes are avalible with by use real world money to buy in game points to obtain the other classes with the most expensive ones being about 20$ wareframe plays exceptionaly well and is just plain fun especially with other playersyour friends however because wareframe is free the majority of the gameplay is essentially paytowin due to the better items and other classes being available through the use of real world money thats not to say that wareframe is a bad game because its not but this one aspect is enough to be a huge turnoff for some people
recommended
this game is amazing by visuels graphics everything about it is awesome a must get now
recommended
game is just like dead spacemass effectwarframe
recommended
started this game a few hours ago because i wanted something more indepth than defiance this game is great so far the scifi feel is fantastic and the graphics are phenominal as a freetoplay game it is definitely worth a shot
recommended
extremely fun and addicting  yezzinator 2014
recommended
basically its a fast paced super sentai game you are a badass in spandex in the future slicing punching and shooting at bad guys at super speed if you are decent or trying to avoid death git gud mango bosses are easy and youll enjoy this piece of software at least 3050 hours until you are forced to grind forever to acquire a new pair of metal breasts for your space waifu play alone or with one other player never join 4 player missions because its a cluster grafixx 810 sound 310 gameplay 710 p2w ratio 610

totes mlg much wow
recommended
just 4 word this game is awesome 
recommended
roughtly this game is metroid meets team fortress 2 but actually in a deeper sense or actually in my disturbed mind the tennos are the metaphor for the perfect society the grineers are the metaphor of the communists the corpus are the metaphor of the capitalists the infected are the metaphor of the anarchists and the corrupted are probably some revoluting people that join force from everywhere across the world twisted logic
recommended
great gameno reason for you to not have it cause its freegot bored at the 1000 hour markbut the devs keep the game some what fresh with constant updates

pay to win es pay to win play with a group of friends its more fun that way plus you wont get mugged by a hoard of bad guys on the higher leveled missions im suprised how well the game runs when played online lots of different warframes to pick from each of them having their own unique abilities but each of them costs like a whole new game
recommended
like it kinda sort of cybernetic ninja and with gunz
recommended
this game is assy approved with assy seal of awesome you must download it
recommended
ive been with this game for awhile now for a free to play its as good as they come clans survivals defenses exterminations mobile defenses interceptions constant alets solar rail wars and dark sector conflicts not to mention they recently added kubrows or dogs that can kick  along side your player instead of just robots this game has progressivly gotten better over time the devs love and reward feedback of all kinds if the community hates something it will be addressed asap cany say that about many other games can you it is free to play you can earn every item in the game playing and not only that but while grinding away for weapons and loot you will find loot other players want which means you can sell it for platinum not only can you play free but you can freely earn certain boosters and materials that are easier to buy then find without buying  the amount of customability on your warframe weapons and companions makes it pretty damn unique too best weapon in the game kinda a loose term here since if you put alot of work into any wep it will blow  away if your feeling down on fire or passion for playing other games you own try warframe out just remember 3 weeks from now that you do have other games that you payed for that are not of this quality happy hunting captain bamf get some you space ninjas
recommended
this game is freaking amazing an amazing coop experience the gameplay is fantastic the graphics are beautiful it has controller support good for people who dislike keyboard and mouse on 3rd person games such as myself and best of all its free
recommended
you can have your own personal fan stalking you everywhere and sending you creepy messages 1210
recommended
they should make this game for mac
recommended
first of all im not a fan of these kinda mmos grinding and typical slow lockon spelloncooldown gameplayi like mmorpgs though but warframe is quite different and unique the core gameplay is very dynamic fast paced action combining 3rd person shooter melee fighting and magiclike abilities everything is realtime fast and requires some skill from a player you go on various missions in up to 4 player teams to combat hordes of enemies that can rise in numbers and levels quickly providing you as much challenge as you can take the movement in this game is also great you can do many trick jumps run on wals and almost fly around if you know what you are doing there is even stealth which is fun and useful if you want to play solo now the addictive part is of course acquiring new weapons classes warframes and rare mods that augument weapons and warframes and believe me there are so many things to get and to level up some are hidden quite deep there is quite a lot of grinding but the process itself fun because the challenge escalates fast the game is honest free2play and you can unlock everything but if you want to keep everything you will have to buy inventory slots with platinum which is bought for real money or traded for rare mods between players so you dont really need to spend a dime if you are willing to grind the downside it doesnt have a huge overworld that you can walk around and explore like most other mmos just individual missions some things are still being polished and improved needs more variety in environments and missions the game is mostly pve focused there is pvp but its still in ongoing development overall its a great game for everyone who loves action intense horde combat and mmoarpg levelling and farming for loot gameplay 10 graphics 10 conclave 8 dojo 9 updates 10 grinding 10 farming 10 replayability 9 story i came to kill stuff for free overall score 98 matthew olls

your a fat giant maybe black nigerian elf in a robotic  costume shooting at expired milk aliens that look like they need gallons of proactive daily to survive but then again when u slide ur giant sword up their  who needs it overall i think this game gives me s daily sometimes to the extent where i have repainted my living room white

hmm what to say played it for about 15 minutes with the fam just about threwup from the mindless grinding of enemy waves hit altf4 responded really well got me out of this torm of code pretty quick so cudos to you developers for letting people have a shortcut to exit your nightmare creation 1010 ign great for uninstalling
recommended
i love this game i sped half a year playing it
recommended
when it comes to f2p free to play games people often tread carefuly as for the regular pitfalls pay now and not get stuck in que and have a real game experience warframe however seams to be apart from most f2p games in this regard a fun run and gun game style that is easy to learn and takes some time to be good at  a great coop game for some mates
recommended
very fun when you first play the game and it has a great theme to it however there is no end game content currently and the game is just one big grindfest

recommended
i enjoy the game a lot been with the game since beta at first take a bit to learn the controls but after its great dont really care about grinding to get cool items since i enjoy doing the missions and playing with friend so far one of the best free to play games ever and how it done right love the graphics and battle format and shooting and swords fighting ninja jumping off walls hopefully the game will stay awsome till the end
recommended
best game ever  this game required skill and some of your money to level up but when it does it totally worth it
recommended
this game is awesome i have no other words for something like this except maybe nah just awesome
recommended
although it is in beta still this game feels more like release graphics are stunning gameplay polished and lore quite furnished it is updated regularly each thursday and every month or 2 there is a major update bringing new gear lore and game mechanics mission types gear type this game is a fps first person shooter with a lot of action wallwalking sliding coptering it requires planning and strategic thinking though as higher level missions become quickly lethal without it all in all i quite enjoy playing it although i myself am not a fps fan which is why i recommend it update 23042015  this game has been released only to become better since i last reviewed it although some bugs are slow to fix nothing gamebreaking most are fixed pretty fast even as a casual i already spent 1k hours on it playing it without steam so it doesnt really reflect the real amount of time ive spen on it the visuals as still as stunning and becoming better new mechanics were introduced making the game a bit harder and a lot more enjoyable nothing dark soulslike since last time the devs also added tutorials so its noob friendly too quests factions syndicates hubseverything needed for a successful game
recommended
personally if you are about to make a game that has ninja aliens mixed with submachine guns you have very high expectations from the community warframe is an amazing fastpaced game where like i said you are pretty much a ninja with gun you can be paired up in a team of 4 or in a 4v4 game of capture the flag for being a freetoplay game this game is a musthave for people who dont want to spend money on games the combat is a real work of art from sliding on the ground to superattacks this game is packed with new things to learn one thing i do suggest to do is to include a basic combat skills tutorial for new players who really have no idea what to do this is one of my most favorite games of all time and it just is all around a great game
recommended
if your looking for a shooter that passes time by as fast as a bird well warframe is the game for you
recommended
this game is freaking awesome
recommended
let me put this in the form of questions do you like ninjas if so this is the game for you do you like space if so this is the game for you do you like third person shooters if so this is the game for you do you like hitting things with swords if so this is the game for you do you like getting entire games for absolutely free and not having to pay for anything afterwards even the highest level items if so this is the game for you in other words get it you have absolutely nothing to lose
recommended
alternate title space ninjas vs zombies warframe is a game where you are a ninja in space sometimes you do ninja things well you would if the parkour system was any good this will hopefully be fixed with the addition of the new parkour 20 system but as it currently stands you feel more like a fking helicopter than a ninja you have a large selection of space weapons to choose from including highly advanced snipers laser guns pistols that shoot explosives and bows im sorry what no highly advanced space bows that shoot heat seeking laser guided arrows just regular bows hmm yeah okay i give this game a 1010 roll credits
recommended
best game evar haha jk thats me being hyperbolic warframe is a nice tps in beta which has pros and cons first it got its own style original imagine space ninja going on a raid in a illegal mining facility managed by evil villains thats what you get in this game the concept is great but unfortunately poor gamers who cant pay will have to suffer the wait system and lack of weaponsuit slot yes you have inventory limit in this game and everytime you craft your weapon you have to wait around halfday  if you are one of these poor gamers dont sweat the trading community in this game can cover your platinum in game exclusive currency available by paying real money needs although it takes more time so enjoy this playtonotwait game
recommended
nice gamebut it is riddled with bugs even now gameplay is a fun action game which as everyone explains and it is the best way to put it you are essentially a space ninja with friends it can be a lot a of fun and be a good time waster but alone it can get repetitive fairly quick at first glance it seems like the game has a lot of areas to explore the truth is a lot of them are recycled much in the way it was in dragon age 2 if people remember that annoyance as for the bugs there are a lot and some are even game breaking such as melee randomly stop working on both keyboard and controller i had this happen multiple times chat locking up and making you unable to access any of the menus if an alert ends while youre in the mission sometimes doors wont function clipping issues with some parts of the map fell through and above the map several times a huge lag issue with pvp mode both sides said everyone was telephoning around and last but not least not a bug but just a painno way to get rid of unwanted kubrows beyond killing them off which takes 10 days and shouldnt have to come to that or being forced to buy another slot it is just a waste
recommended
ninjas are cool but what is better that ninjas play free shoot stab magicafykill with magic and dash to be one with the ninja is absolute this is my story of my first experiences with this game i loved f2p games at the time and i saw warframe as a open beta i played it and it was very different to now but after a while i got bored it was way too repetitive about a year or 2 later i got bored of other games lol and came back to warframe almost everything changed in the game more stuff  more fun yes it is still a bit repetitive but there is more to aim for more quests more stuff in general that is why a reccomend warframe and give it a 9510
recommended
amazing game was better than i expected for a free game cant believe its free really difficult too only critic i have got is that it got bad steam support and may be too hard in some aspects and a bit gear dependent for your own warframe basicly you control a warframe or hero or a unit like halo which you can pick from alternative classes or warframes as to speak which you can find and collect and craft weapons to level up with aswell tons of levels and a story and excellent graphics and smooth gameplay and active online player base

ive read a bunch of the negative reveiws and most are people who dont know how to play the game right so heres a list of solutions to all that stuff problem rng dependent progression solution dont transmute mods unless they are low quality rare mods are actually valuable so there cant be a surefire way to get them otherwise the game would have no content problem too much farming solution stop trying to farm for highend items right off the bat you actually have to look at what resources you have access to and choose your next weaponwarframe from there in most games you find the weapon you want then farm what you need here its actually a challenge to get stuff problem stuff never drops solution do something else on the same planet and after no time youll have what you need if youre looking for a more rare resource do an assassination they are garunteed to drop at least one of their planets rarest resource so its more reliable than just hoping it will pop out of a basic enemy problem endgame takes forever solution this game is not for people who want to buy a game play for an hour or two then have every item that ever existed this game actually gives a challenge in getting items theyre worth a lot more than people think problem mods too rare solution thats because theyre worth something they provide more advancement than just getting the next weapon in fact they are about as rare as weapons in other games you just have to get over the fact that theyre powerful and you dont get them every two seconds also mod farming is incredibly inefficient just find something else to do and they will come faster than you think if you have a theifs wit mod you probably do theyre incredibly common then dont throw it away it makes getting mods a million times easier problem pay to win solution stop trying to buy youre way to endgame thats not where the content is also prime weapons can be built like any other and they mostly have the same stats as the normal version but with different mod polarities its also somewhat of an accomplishment to build one so its sort of a show of your prestige at the game problem overpriced platinum solution yet again all the items are worth more than you probably think the prices match the gameplay it would take to build the item so theyre actually pretty fair and the only things that cost a lot are weapons and warframes which are more fun to build anyway problem monotonous missions solution play different missions farming the same thing may seem efficient but its just going to make you think thats all there is problem math solution oh im sorry i didnt realize using basic multiplication to compare two things is so hard thats really too much for you to handle overall this is a great game it does take awhile to get stuff but thats because its not meant to be completed the idea is that not all of the content is locked off till you reach endgame its distributed throughout the progression of game so items are valuable yet not impossible to obtain at every stage of the game youll love it as long as you dont expect to become grand champion of the universe a day after you play it

the game is incredibly fun but has some issues with a handful of mechanics here and there it very much relies on the well its still technically in beta excuse that being said it is sometimes a valid excuse sometimes content updates can seem few and far between and other times it seems like they release update after update within a few days that being said they tend to fix things that are broken even if it does take them some time while i do not agree with all of the creative paths they have chosen to take the community has responded very well to it really bringing lifeblood to the game despite all of this warframe achieves the simplest need for any game to be fun it has a lot going for it and the developers really care about their product and they both care that people enjoy it as much as they need it for profits that being said the freemium incentives can be a bit much ingame you can play the entire game freetoplay but there are times where if you really want to enjoy the game you have to spend money the simplest example of this is inventory slots you are limited to a certain number at the beginning of the game and more can only be obtained through purchase using realworld currency equivalents that being said i tend to find the thought well its okay these developers deserve my money for the amazing product they have provided floating through my head just be careful not to go overboard the game is worth an initial cash purchase of $20$40 but no game is worth the hundreds some people are willing to sink into the game despite some of the negativity in this review i have to give the game an overallpositive thumbs up this is just because the game is so damn fun the parkour is entertaining if a bit buggy at times which only adds to the hilarity the combat is effective and you feel like you have an impact if appropriately leveled archwing has grown on me somewhat if still a bit lacking in my opinion dont get me wrong its great but i earnestly believe it didnt need to be in the game the weapon and character varieties keep the game spicy and customization is off the charts the one tip i have to you concerning this game dont play too much youll burn yourself out immediately and it can get very depressing to wait ingame for something to construct oh i suppose i should mention that too before this review is over crafting an item and often times the pieces for that item as well can take hours it takes 25 missions for individual resources depending on the complexity of the item and the rarity of the resource and then you set the item up to build in the foundry which can take hours no im not exaggerating most characters called warframes take about 12 hours to build each individual part helmet suit and systems though they can all be worked on simultaneously plus 3 days to combine the three together i despise the amount that this incentivizes the freemium model for collecters like myself but i will admit its satisfying when its done what was i saying oh right burning yourself out the reason i mention the foundry is because within the first few months of play i started to feel overwhelmed with grinding and waiting and i was doing the parts of the game i hated while waiting for the parts i wanted which made the parts i wanted feel disappointing the game is fun but recognize which parts of the game you like and dont play the parts you hate to the point of upset i suppose most people should take this for granted but you may find yourself just too damn addicted to the game if this happens back off put the game down for a few days ignore the login rewards they get disappointing after a while then come back a week later the game will seem as fresh new and fun as it did within your first week of play overall the game has its issues and while it hasnt overcome all of its issues yet the amount of fun the game provides is well worth it buy play this game

was a little skepitcal when i first started playing the game there are only a dozen or so mission types so i was worried that it was going to get repetative fast but thus far it hasnt running nightmare missions for the best mods in the game has a nice challange makes it feel more like a game than a grind fest f2p thus far i havent found it to be p2w but then again pvp is really nonexistant i feel that adding in some better pvp will be the main way to ensure that this game actually hangs around edit  after 100 or so hours of playing the missions do indeed get repeative it also sucks to play without friends i would have liked some more variety in the game things cost to much platinum imo while yes you can earn most everything for free buying those warframe slots are pretty pricey

so youre in space right and youre like a ninja and stuff theres like these super gross human clone guys and these really stupid looking mailbox robot men like ugh this game is so uncool youre a freaking space ninja and your mission is essentially to go around the solar system messing life up for a bunch of things that want to rule the galaxy your weapons theyre basically anything you could ask for and more are constantly being made do you want to be an invisible force that empties entire ships without setting off an alarm try ash who has the ability to teleport to every enemy in a room and stab them in a back its cooler than it sounds want to screw with the angry folks as you slaughter them en masse get vauban and throw vortexes at people yep straightup vortexes maybe youve decided that guns and throwing knives and stuff are for sissies want to just run to the front lines and destroy entire armies with punches and kicks valkyr she has the added bonus of allowing you to screw with your team mates by yanking them away from whereever theyre going oh you can kinda use that on enemies too i guess weaponry is an awesome component to this game for the more traditional third person shooter youve got a nice range of assault weapons that satisfy any gamer want to dualwield revolvers and mod them to be able to clear a room and look stylish go right ahead want a sword to chop through your enemies with ease enjoy of course maybe youd like something a little more interesting as in perhaps youd like a gun that fires 5 lasers in a wide berth that you can adjust the focus of in order to deal with different sized groups maybe instead of a sword youd like a frisbee thats covered in blades perhaps a gun that shoots goo goo that explodes a laser lmg a electrowhip a sawblade launcher a bow and set of throwing knives that freaking chop peoples limbs off still not satisfied maybe take a trip into the outer reaches of space into forgotten space temples loaded with corrupted enemies that hit harder and drop better gear perhaps your ember warframe doesnt really convey awesome to you enough how about you take a few trips to the void and get a version thats head is on fire and all of this is free warframe play it

a great game crafted with love and passion which makes it obvious from the large amount of content since its release unfortunately it has a horrible economic system which behaves like capitalism in a nutshell but it doesnt make it impossible to achieve items and relics without spending a penny
recommended
first things first  this game does look attractive  if you ignore the fact that the character models look like theyre concept art or something secondly  i did have trouble getting my head around the game the ingame tutorial is lacking and often leaves you confused about what to do next it took me quite a long time to figure out the nature of the polarity slots  by spending several hours and days on warframewiki to try and make sense of everything  which you will also be doing at some point thirdly  the quest system is completely backwards imagine if you will a quest line in any other game one quest leads you to a new quest etc etc well in warframe the first quest is simple but then youre given quests that are rediculously hard to achieve at first because you need to grind for parts of a machine that you havent even built yet because that takes 72 hours and then build the thing so in a sense youre on a quest to collect parts for a machine and when you get them you have to wait 72 hours to actually do the quest its pathetic this waiting time is forced upon you by the developers to make money so they deliberately make the game a waiting game you can either sit around for 72 hours before progressing further  or you can pay fourthly  repetitiveness youll soon come to terms with the fact that this game is a grind fest if you like grinding  youll love warframe but even that does have a cracking point allinall the game does have its flaws but it is attractive and enjoyable to play the abilities of certain classes are awesome to use but youll have to farm repetitively for parts of that class in order to be able to build that class which has a waiting time remember before you can play that class are you seeing where this is going if you enjoy nonsensical violence and enjoy exercising your patience then this is for you
recommended
this game is definitley worth going for if you love hack and slash with third person shootnig action immediately got hooked on the first level itself

you can earn everything except character colorpacks scarfs and petsentinalattachments by playing the game it takes time but thats what this game is about as you continue playing and you unlock more things to play withand oh boy is there a lot of cool stuff to get and more being added all the time or you can spend as much as you would buying a regular game to just purchase what you want immidiately its a very fair business model that doesnt beg or rob you when it comes to the games content to play theres quite a lot here all of it is free you can selfres 4 times before the game wants you to pay a bit of money but do not worry as after 24 hours these selfresses reset you can still play more missions without selfres tokens its just if you die again the mission is a failure which is really no biggy if you have teammates which normally always pick you back up like in gears of war its very addicting to work towards your next weaponwarframe unlock overall sound 510  going to be honest here many stock freebiesound effects here and theres barely any recogniseable sountrack throughout the game apart from the theme tune which kinda rips of terminator 2 im just being truthful i still love warframe but its sounds are copy>paste>edit jobs from other sources gameplay 810  addicting fun but dont expect everything for free or to leech levels off of players you need to play the game to get what you want i still feel more gamemodes and more maptiles are needed you quickly run out of unique content and go into repeating content you must join a clan to get the top tier clanonly weapons dont forget to join one or youre missing out feels sooo much better when you play with friends i highly advise this graphics 710  not bad for the start of nextgen but seen better turn off color correction as this actually causes incorrections in colorgreen turns into yellow for example the game is unbelievably super optimized running very cool on the graphics card and isnt one of those lets burn your hardware games

its very fun also good for waisting time but after a while you start to wonder what kind of drug the team was abusing when they decided their prices for platinum

warframe is an interesting and innovative puzzle game rather than the player trying to figure out how to use the game mechanics in order to progress the game plays itself in the players mind the goal is simple you must escape the arsenal screen sounds easy right youd be mistaken the second you click appearance the game has you hooked it will not let you go until you have the right colors what are the right colors exactly you have to figure that out yourself buying new color pallettes will make the game either harder or easier but the game does not tell you which ones do so i have managed to beat this game once playing as valkyr it took a few hours but i knew i had won once i started playing a mini game theyre called missions ingame and didnt compulsively feel the need to return to the appearance tab at last i had been freed but i am still determined to beat the game with each warframe i own if you like games that challenge the players mind this is for you
recommended
one of the best free to plays i think i have ever played including demos and mods and to those who say its pay to win dont listen to them they are just trolling the review its actually quite balanced first 3 free classes are some of the most powerful ones now if you want to spend $10 usd than go ahead get a new class but all you are buying is a completly diffrent skill set all classes have their own uniqe play style so do youre homework and look them up on the warframe website

warframe is a free to play construction simulation game here you and your team of tenno home improvement and weapons must complete a vast array of timed contracts for your many customers the game features some unforgetful characters such as captain charles vor a retired navy captain from the grineer naval school and alad whats in the bag v a board member of the corpus lumber yard the games name refers to the warframe a special tool the tenno use to beat their competition in contracts it is a special tool belt and vest that surrounds its user in high tech grade a tools from harbour and freight 810 really fun game but lots of grinding but fun enough that it doesnt matter f2p and not p2w so thats good

warframe has got to be one of my most favorite games of all time and it still as the developers want to say hasnt fully released despite having enough content to make three games not only is warframe free but its also updated often and has quite a lot of replayability pros 1 warframes a warframe is an exosuit designed for your tenno which is basically the entire point of the game and is even its name you start off the game by picking one of three frames excalibur loki and volt before proceeding through the tutorial mission and selecting your beginner weapons as you go through the game there will be a massive collection of warframes to collect with their own unique powers and stats some of which are passive like mesas health bonus if you dont take a melee weapon into battle or zephyrs lowgravity these frames can be bought with platinum from the game store or crafted with blueprints purchased from the game store with credits some frames the only few so far being mesa limbo and mirage must be crafted through quests which take you through bits of the games story and missions to acquire pieces to the blueprints which you must craft similarly to the other warframes there are a total of twentytwo unique warframes not including their prime variations and all are a blast to acquire and use 2 weapons this game has a large variety of weapons and when i say large i mean borderlands 2large from pistols to snipers to a light machine gun from daggers to hammers to glaives to a literal gunsword there are at least one or two weapons released every few hotfixes and updates and if i bothered to count each individual weapon whether they were from events were primed versions or are from syndicates and tried to explain each one we could easily be here all night just looking over it all melee wepoans come with their own special mods which allows for melee combos and increased capacity to its mod points and add immensely to the level of gameplay in warframe each melee weapon type has its own individual stance mod there are twenty categories of melee weapons available for you to choose from and still growing with each update 3 mods mods in warframe allow you to increase stats on a weapon warframe sentinel or kubrow mods can even be sold in the player market for the games funbuckcurrency platinum or transmuted to create a new mod which a chance to get a rare mod these mods can be upgraded singularly to provide better benefits like 100% more damage or 70% more crit rate and the effectiveness of these mods depends on the weapons stats alone one weapon may benefit from a critrate mod more than others going from a 5% crit rate to 25% while another would only go from 2% to 5% due to it being meant for a different build this allows you to really look and see what fits best for a weapon to make it as effective as possible allowing you to do the math in your head to enter the battlefield with a literal monster in your hands the amount of mods you can put on a weapon are determined by the polarity or polarities of a weapon or warframe if the warframeweapon has an orokin reactorcatalyst installed and if the warframe has an aura mod installed or the weapon melee only has a stance mod installed aurastance mods provide extra points depending on the level of the mod itself and the polarity of the stance or aura slot matching a mod polarity to a slot polarity will greatly increase the number of points it gives you for aurastance mods or decrease the amount of points it uses for basic mods 4 platinum now for a touchy subject with every freetoplay game the premium currency platinum warframe in my personal opinion gets this bit right in the best possible way platinum is very expensive and for all the right reasons this is because they allow you to immediately purchase special resources weapons cosmetics or even entire warframes the frames and weapons coming with their respective orokin catalysts or reactors as well as an inventory slot there are few things that can only be achieved through platinum the most important being warframe slots and weapon slots which can be recieved by doing events which give free weapons inviting enough friends into the game purchasing premium or prime access directly or trading some ingame goodies with other players for platinum these goodies could be rare maxranked mods for weapons or even prime parts earned from the void that you can get for simply playing the game long enough there is no such thing as pay to win in warframe especially considering its marketed as a coop game if there is anything of the sorts like this its moreorless pay to get quicker and even then you could only pay 40 platinum to speed a weapons build time as opposed to buying the weapon for 250 platinum alone 5 grinding id like to make a note here that grinding is absolutely no reason to dislike a game as every game has grinding when you follow the definition we use in gaming grinding for exp grinding for money grinding for weapons or armor or whatever every game has potential for a grindfest and while warframe is subject to this a good majority of mmos and rpgs are as well cons i cant think of any other than the occasional bug that wont really be noticeable unless you look for it with the sole intention of pointing it out the developers dont really try to milk money out of you as much as they try to keep you playing the game but if i dont put something here someone will cry 1 rngesus as you would expect with just about any game the system at which items are rewarded mostly pertaining to prime parts are at random since prime parts can only be obtained from void missions or trading platinum for it and since there is such a whopping large majority of prime weapons and warframes this means that you could spend a week of grinding through void missions for parts you want to build a prime weapon or prime warframe you want example overall id give this game a 95 out of 10 and id recommend it to anyone looking to get into a shooter

do you enjoy fast paced shooters hectic clutch moments and the feeling you get when you beat a difficult boss this game has all of those and much more sure the limited color options for your warframe are pretty sucky but the overall game itself is amazing

i love the graphics in this game for one they put a lot of unneeded detail into this game not quite as much detail for its generation as metroid 3 which still surpasses graphics in many games currently being created though it was for the wii i also love the combat style and really everything else my only complaint is how annoying it is to unlock everything however that annoyance makes this game fun

the short version the best 3rd person shooter game ive played 9510 with very minimal pay 2 win elements this game is bred for success with elements from halo assassins creed and diablo this game adds an exciting mixture of space combat parkour and looting you buy blueprints to build various guns and items as your journey through procedurally generated levels where no playthrough is the same though you grind with friends and effort your grinding will be fruitful after 112 hours of gameplay today i experienced bugs only on one level which ive played easily 30 different worlds each taking a nice variety of successes and failures triumphs and losses not only are there different levels theres different game types you can run into a place and your mission is to kill everyone or to spy and gather intellegence or assassinations where your try to take out a war master more will be added in the future thanks for reading i hope to see you in game

have you ever played a facebook game and thought wow this is really boring and makes me feel like a filthy casual have you ever played an fps with a protagonist rocking a crewcut and qtes and thought man this videogame about shooting dudes is great [note no its not] but i sure wish i could run like a sweet ninja to the other wall have you ever bought a videogame and thought oh my god this cost way too much money for how much i get out of it try warframe its free you cheap cheap person you you are a magic robot ghost thing maybe who just woke up from a really long nap and the dudes who woke you up are trying to put holes in you with their guns lucky for you you woke up inside of a warframe [note this is what the game is named after] which is basically a robot ninja body which bleeds for some reason even more luckily for you your hot psychic magic robot ghost mom maybe notices youre awake and tells you how to use your cybernaruto body spoiler alert you escape then you proceed to do missions across the solar system for dosh and swag which you use to fashion glocks and katanas and more immediately useful swag you can even make new mechamagical musashi bodies to walljump and phsysicsengineabuse teleportjump over dudes with its not pay2win but it is pay2winfaster making stuff takes time like 12 hours time or longer if youre making a new technoryu hayabusa to jump around in spending the irl currencybased currency of which you get a little bit for free can make that go faster dont use it for that you can also outright buy sick new weapons or frames or resources dont use it for that unless you decide to get the prime packs richie rich you can also buy more slots for the number of warfames youre allowed or number of weapons spend it on these you will thank me later overall though the game is fun if you run it with friends but not public matchmaking those jerks will vanish a million miles ahead of you kill everything then call you fat while they wait for you to get to the mission exit use only if you want to roflstomp a mission or need endurancedistractionsablative armor 42010 pretty dank would buy again

now you can be a space ninja from space the gist pros  fun as hell easy as hell free as hell in depth and intense as hell cons  pvp is hell hell is not a theme of this game definitely worth trying elaboration first off this game isnt as much ninja sneaky sneaky stabbby stabby shuriken throwing smoke bombs as much as it samurai slashy slashy shooty shooty plasma bomb throwing time stopping stomp it is an anime fighting game without the sharp hairdos and boobs bouncing all over the place which is a let down to some but fear not it is fun and intense there is a lot to say about this game two of the major points are 1 you dont have to pay a cent 2 you are going to pay more than just a cent the reason for this contradicting statement is this the game allows you to work for any of the items or characters in the game but overdriving items is impossible without some payment and you cant color customize your ninja robot suit without buying a color scheme first btw if you do play it just buy the classic saturated color set its all you need this game has crafting grinding pvp mini quests 2 companions a robot thingy and a dog boss fights both melee weapons and ranged weapons free running  kind of  a party of 4 players build your own dojo build you own defense system platform thing so much blood abilities and a ninja suit specific ultimate ability theres probably some stuff im forgetting this game is something different and you should for sure download it and give it a try im not disappointed at the $15 i spent on this game so far its fun and keeps me coming back and its not because of the daily login rewards or new shiny content but because there is a lot to do and level up and it doesnt get old there are so many god damned weapons to try out and make and max out that it is impossible to put a playtime value to this game if i had to it would be forever the pvp at the moment is just  its not balanced maxed out weapons one shot people some abilities are way too powerful and overpower the arena completely and there will come a time when you are going to enter an instance and not see a single enemy because the maxed out er flew ahead of you and blew up the map blew up the map ive been that blowthemapup guy as well  itsh pretty fun  but youll get over it there is a solo matchmaking option and if youve got a friend or two you guys can just jam together this game keeps growing and i think it will continue to grow a brilliant new twist on a fps that brings in elements of a dungeon grinding game try it i mean its free to play so why not right

it was an ordinary day in my life a few months after my girlfriend left me i came across warframe she smiled at me and asked do you wanna be a spaceninja it is fun being a spaceninja desperate to find a cure for my broken heart i gave it a shot warframe was right being a spaceninja is fun days weeks months passed i no longer think of my of my exgirlfriend everyday i look forward spending time with warframe instead she looks good she is creative she is actionpacked shes very adventurous she made me feel needed by the universe she made me feel strong she made me feel special shes not the typical girlfriend she didnt demand much money so she can be a better girlfriend to me all she wanted was my time she asked for money only when i wanted a new space suit and only when i needed a new shelf for my spaceninja toys you can choose to spend on her but trust me it isnt necessary you dont have to pay to win her love warframe is probably the perfect girl whose only flaw is that she is overlyattached shes all i wanted to be with but it came to a point when she started asking so much of my time so that we can do the very same thing we were already doing for a year she wanted me to get her this resource then that resource then another so i can craft more spaceninja stuff which eventually will be worth nothing but a spaceninja trophy in my shelf i felt the pressure i felt strangled it was repetitive it was tiring then is when i realized i needed a break we didnt see each other for a few weeks it was strange because i loved her so much but i never felt the need to see her again i miss her sometimes yes she said she misses me too and so we decided to be just friends now we see each other every now and then but no more commitments i think it is better this way enjoying each others company without the pressure of doing so much for her warframe indeed is good for casual fun but the moment you take it seriously and love it more than you should then is when youll realize that she demands so much more than you can give then is when youll fall out of love right away and realize that all those work are for a relationship that you will be soon leaving if you wanna make a serious longterm relationship with someone go on warframe is the one to be with but if youre the type who gets bored easily by doing the exact same thing for no real purpose find someone else to love i still recommend her though because she at least does her best to give you the fun you deserve

warframe is a 1to4player coop thirdperson action title that combines gunplay melee combat and freerunning environment traversal in equal measures and does all three very well the firearms are numerous and widely varied and they deliver satisfying feedback the melee combat is visceral brutal and lightning fast the freerunning though it takes a bit to learn the ins and outs of the games physics is mostly smooth and makes you feel like a badass space ninja the warframes characters each have uniqueand highly gratifyingpower sets and therefore unique strengths and weaknesses but the deep and complex modding system allows you to enhance weapons and warframes to suit your favorite playstyle or to exploit the specific weaknesses of the games various enemiesfactions the developers are always on top of it often delivering hotfixes within hours of a bugs discovery major updates come fairly often further increasing the games already expansive array of goodies major eventsinstances can yield exclusive equipment to participants the game is freetoplay but is very careful to avoid being construed as a paytowin title aside from purely cosmetic itemsfeatures you can obtain everything through normal gameplay every character gun sword sentinel blueprint component resource and material can be acquired through completing events and missions farming or boss rushing using platinum the games realmoney currency simply saves you time the community is very friendly and cooperative offering up information tips and aid to new players when requested becoming a member of a clan has tangible benefits as there are certain perks items and weapons that can only be obtained through claninitiated research there are always clan warlords looking for new recruits if youre a fan of shooters ninjas coop or scifi this game is definitely worth a look its free so youve got nothing to lose

this game was a nice and game when it started early close beta and to this day it only got better more wapons more warframes some bugs are still there not to much of a problem and these bugs are there from close beta that is a point the can work on so if you are new neet some help ask me nepir that is 1 of the things i like you can help noobs get a nice start or even a warframe this game 9510 fix the bugs and you got a 10

you can earn everything except character colorpacks scarfs and petsentinalattachments by playing the game it takes time but thats what this game is about as you continue playing and you unlock more things to play withand oh boy is there a lot of cool stuff to get and more being added all the time or you can spend as much as you would buying a regular game to just purchase what you want immidiately its a very fair business model that doesnt beg or rob you when it comes to the games content to play theres quite a lot here all of it is free you can selfres 4 times before the game wants you to pay a bit of money but do not worry as after 24 hours these selfresses reset you can still play more missions without selfres tokens its just if you die again the mission is a failure which is really no biggy if you have teammates which normally always pick you back up like in gears of war its very addicting to work towards your next weaponwarframe unlock overall sound 510  going to be honest here many stock freebiesound effects here and theres barely any recogniseable sountrack throughout the game apart from the theme tune which kinda rips of terminator 2 im just being truthful i still love warframe but its sounds are copy>paste>edit jobs from other sources gameplay 810  addicting fun but dont expect everything for free or to leech levels off of players you need to play the game to get what you want i still feel more gamemodes and more maptiles are needed you quickly run out of unique content and go into repeating content you must join a clan to get the top tier clanonly weapons dont forget to join one or youre missing out feels sooo much better when you play with friends i highly advise this graphics 710  not bad for the start of nextgen but seen better turn off color correction as this actually causes incorrections in colorgreen turns into yellow for example the game is unbelievably super optimized running very cool on the graphics card and isnt one of those lets burn your hardware games

great game friend no like he say no play more game i say why game was fun we laughed we cried we didnt win but we played friend said no i said yes

warfram is a solid co op shooter the shooting is fun but the it takes ages to unlock anything and the ai is  but with amazing combat and cool aesthetics i can over look some of these flaws 7510

when it comes to f2p free to play games people often tread carefuly as for the regular pitfalls pay now and not get stuck in que and have a real game experience warframe however seams to be apart from most f2p games in this regard a fun run and gun game style that is easy to learn and takes some time to be good at  a great coop game for some mates
recommended
recomend it was the  when i got it now i just have to pay for everything i want to unlock
recommended
a game that gets fun once you put in the time sync this game works around taking time to craft items and getting drops from enemies to craft those items the game can start out slow for some but i enjoyed it the whole way and once you get to the lategame segments of you maxing out your weapons to the fullest and having your favorite warframe equipped is well worth the time sync and is worth money to put into if you like the game enough
recommended
constantly updated gets better by the day
recommended
one of the two best indie games of 20132014 strongly recommend
recommended
great game

love it
recommended
well apparently this game is good still needs some polish here and there but the design itself is worth the investment
recommended
really good gamge funny with friend not need to pay any real money yo ucan farm everything

warframe is like finding a new food you love you eat it for 2 months straight and then get bored of it and never eat it again this game is 5 on my top 5 played games and is peaking just over 100 hours that was pretty as much as i could get through without having to pay as you only get a few suit slots and a limited number of weapon slots its tons of fun while it lasts
recommended
its like skyrim with space ninjas without skyrim but seriously not buying this game is a crime

great game only con i have to say is the updates are getting more and more pointless

warframe is a third person shooter game about being a awesome futuristic ninja much like shinobi and shooting guns faster then sonic can say boooost within the game you are a troubled high school weeaboo with no parents and no relatives one day you fail your gcse so badly that they have to lock you up in a time cage that erases your memorirs and renders you a copy of shadow the hedgehog 300 years later a delivery ship lands on a planet that you were trapped in to drop off a shipment of twinkies but the store owner who ordered these was drunk and challanged the delivery boy to a fight the delivery boy however was massively ripped and had a 12 pack and knocked out the store owner with one slug in the face the delivery boy now shooken up from the 2 second fight then declares that he was going to be giving out the twinkies to everyone in town for free everyone then started to move towards him to get a bite but back to you the main character you smell the twinkies and you hear his words thanks to you super twinkie censor and you break out of your imprisonment and then you attempt to go get some twinkies but sadly by the time you step outside he has already left due to no longer having any twinkies angered by your lost chance to get some twinkies you now storm the glaxay crushing all the innocent workers security guards high school attendents and part time workers to find the man who was giving out twinkies for free and get your free twinkies although you are not alone on this epic quest you can team up with a friend or a random player to help you and them on your epic venture to find free twinkies make no hesitation those twinkies are yours they have your name enscripted on it and you know it overall i give the game 9 twinkies out of 10 graphics 10 the game looks very pretty and surrports hd screens despite being 30fps at max sounds 10 there are no stock sounds and surrond sounding makes you feel like your there controls 7 the keyboard and mouse works but no controller surrport is there even though there can be online 9 it works like a charm but there can be disconnection errors depending with who you are playing with and how many flashy effects they have covering the earth multiplayer 10 coop and optional team deathmatch and if you dont like working with people you can always play on your own while i walk a lonely road plays in the background wow hitmarker factor such flash much effects nuff said

this is a realy great game for those who like free rom games

do you want to know a joke i learned while playing warframe destiny
recommended
let us settle the most important questions first i have been playing the game since the early closed beta had seen the game change a lot over the course of that and the 11 updates now the important questions that always come up with free to play games a is it pay to win i would say no some would assume right away that it is because you can use the real money currency platinum to buy weapons and warframes there are a few things that mitigates this 1 weaponswarframes need to be leveled with experience 2 weaponswarframes need mods dropped by mobs in order to become powerful 3 powerful weaponswarframes are gated with mastery rank sort of an account experience someone buying a warframe or weapon still needs to level it and get the mods for it to become powerful which is a matter of available time 90% of the weapons found in the store can be built with a blueprint and the available materials you collect trough the missions you do there are powerful weapons in the game only available via random encounters research or events the only things that one could get from the shop catalyst and reactor used in weapons and warframes to double its mod capacity and forma this in a way helps on that too these are only available via events and random events called alerts forma however can be farmed the only things you cannot get without platinum are cosmetics for pets weaponwarframesentinel slots capes clan badge warframe skinsdifferent color patterns colors and in game account avatars affinity exp booster credit booster and platinum to credit exchange b is it a grind while it was in the closed beta this had gotten a lot better drops have been increased and it is always a matter of know where to get the materials starting out this will be a bit rough but after you get your secondthird warframe it will not be much of a problem so the main question is not exactly how much money you want to spend rather do you have the time to invest in the game if the answer is yes then read further if the answer is no then you are still able to give it a try but you will get stuff at a slower pace 1 what is warframe warframe is a coop tps up to 4 people with limited pvp duels 2v2 fights on selected maps putting emphasis on fast action without having a cover system a lot of people would say it is like mass effect 3 with a mission system especially now with the reworked damage system with update 11 you play space ninjas and have to complete missions in a varied enviroment you start off with one warframe of your choice from the three starter ones excalibur balanced mag more of a caster type or loki mobilityutility frame has no direct damaging ability all warframes come with 4 abilities you fight against three factions over the course of the game each having their own arsenal grineer they are humancyborg people clones whos genes are degrading with each cloning making up for their degradation with cybernetics they are mostly heavily armored with quite a few crowd control units possibly the most varied faction in the game corpus high tech space merchant guild they operate mostly with shields and employ robotics also known as moas they are fairly weak compared to the grineer but they do more damage infested space zombies and the likes they have variations all around have no shields at all some have some form of armor they compensate with health and numbers orokin you will only encounter these later in the game they consists of controlled grineer corpus and infested units only found in the void missions 2 gameplay warframe operates on a solar map system with a variety of missions available at each planet these missions are locked in a chain and needs to be opened by playing the previous mission in the chain when you select a mission depending on the area it is in will generate a map these maps are put together from tiles so you will notice that some rooms look the same sometimes you can get big maps sometimes you get medium to small maps your objectives depend on the type of mission the map is and a few factors sometimes there are random happenings on the mission change of objectives this can happen on the fly faction change you will notice this from lotus mentioning it this will change the enemies spawning the original faction not only fighting you but the newly arrived faction as well no original faction enemies spawn anymore just the newly arrived ones another one of these random events is the arrival of the stalker a powerful enemy warframe this usually happens after boss kills and a certain factor working in the background mostly he arrives when you are not at full potential like leveling a low level warframeweapon if you are alone he will be a tough fight if you are with a group all you have to do is survive long enough for others to burn him down if you triumph he will drop rewards which can be blueprints for his weapons or mods 3 features crafting this is the thing that will take away get the blueprint for weaponwarframe farm the required components and then start the craft the time required is roughly like this 12 hours for most weapons and weaponwarframe components researched weapons mostly 24 hours for pets reactorcatalystforma and 72 hours to complete a warframe you can rush these by using up platinum clans can create a sort of clan hall called dojo they can do the layout themselves and decorate it as they see fit granted this requires materials do weapon research trade duel in specific duel rooms with update 11 people are able to trade mods void keys and platinum so if you have the time and there is a need for it you can trade away rare mods upgraded mostly for platinum from other players events these happen quite frequently sometimes this changes up the map like a faction taking over a planet from the other alerts these are generated missions appearing randomly on the map it mentions the reward type of the mission some things can only come from these alerts aura mods catalystreactor one warframe blueprint pieces some weapons they come up quite frequently and after every warframe livestream scanning new feature you need to buy scanners and scan the enemies for info including some drop table and stat information the developers are always changing the game tweaking here and there this game had changed quite a lot from the start mod system now the damage system is overhauled they are also working constantly on updates nightmare mode some missions will become nightmare missions mobs are higher level and there are special modifiers for the mission like no minimap no shields no energy losing hp etc but if you complete it then your reward is a dual stat mod 4 is it worth it i dont play too much but i like the game if you have the time to kill and want to try a good free to play game then give it a try you might get positively surprised

im not playing as much as i played in beta but it is a very very nice game in terms of pve of course there is little bit pvp in it but this doesnt change the fact that this game rocks

greatest 3rd person shooter ever it is just an all around good game

if i had to sumup warframe in one word techninja it does not get better than that guns swords and endless carnage a few glitches here and there but the gameplay is nonetheless fantastic thirdperson overtheshoulder shooter where you take control of a suit capable of providing endless entertainment filled with bullets gore and flying limbs and on top of all that wallrunning wallclimbing walljumping and what makes this game even more fantastic is that no matter what playstyle you prefer be it stealth tanking or getting in their faces guns and swords flashing there is a warframe with your name on it there are also weapons that complement any playstyle allinall great game with lots of potential

i never wrote a review for this game wow anyway yes warframe ive played this game for over a year at the time of writing this ive got 160 weapons and every warframe to date im a grandmaster founder of the game $250 founders pack have spent hundreds of hours before switching over to steam and also did the original optional reset when it was introduced but lets cut to the chase i definitely recommend this game its the most welldone f2p game out there yes yes ironic to hear it from someone who has poured so much money into the game but i truly mean it want to collect everything excluding founders in the game sure you can without paying anything yep you can grind it all out through collecting resources playing events contributing to the dojo research labs etc nothing is stopping you the gameplay is also fun one match you could be using an assault rifle with a jetpowered hammer and the next you could be using a rocket launcher with a pocket rocket launcher and a pair of daggers you choose so much variety in terms of warframes and weapons  founders gear is exclusive and is unobtainable

if you ever thought to yourself you know i wish mass effect had more space ninjas fighting augmented space people clones of isaac clarke that sound like splicers from bioshock and zombies then this game is for you in all seriousness its a very fun game but it gets fairly repetitive quickly
recommended
p2w games r best
recommended
havent played in a while but i can say this much even before all the newer updates it was a wonderfully fast paced action game in which the missions were sensibly logical and well thought out in design now even though i havent played in so long i would still most definitely recommend this game there is a character for everyone even though its a little grindy to get it once you do you will be happy with it
recommended
love this game so futuristic

very good much yes me like game understanding it is acceptable

i played this game a couple of days it was released for f2p even before it was on steam i hated it it was so damn repetitive sure the first 10 hours of gameplay were fresh and awesome but after noticing that i had to grind to get all the moderate items in the game i gave up of course i tried to i uninstalled it and said goodbye and farewell recently i saw this game thrive on steam and i barely payed attention to it last week i saw it just staring at me and i told a couple of friends hey why not give it another go and just like that we gave it another try i was amazed on how much has changed about this game i found the singleplayer story stuff kind of pointless and sometimes a nuisance i enjoyed playing and toying around in your own personal ship and definitely enjoyed how i many warframes were added there are still some flaws like grinding confusing  menu menu back then was so much more simpler and the singleplayer stuff i do recommend this game and i see bright future updates 8510 i am satisfied good job digital extremes

great fast action mmorpg game saw it recommended in multiple places and it is for a reason the game contains a variety of weapons and classes to choose from last but not least it has really good graphics in my opnion but for a laptop its a little too much but it is still playable and enjoyable great work

warframe is are very heavy shoot them up game if you want a game that is very funny and has hours of game play this is it the game is free you might think its pay to win but its not yes you can pay money to get better stuff but thet items you buy it as good as the player that only way to get better stuff is by doing hard missions and earn the resources to level up and build weapons yes some stuff you can only get with money but if you work to get some rare items people will give platinum which is the playing i dont know to spell a word so screaw this get the game its epic

this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

amazing free to playaction rpg shooter warframe needs a genre description of its owndont make the mistake of thinking of the usual  quality for f2pshootersthis is something else  great quality for a f2pgame with constant updates and improvements  its completely freeyou dont have to spend any money on anything unless you want to no restrictions and all of the platinum purchases are convenience  theres a wide selection of warframesweapons and cosmetic items and new stuff is constantly getting added  tons of contentaltho quality of the content variesit is mostly lobbybased indoor tunnelshooting missions and levels can get repetetive since there isnt an awful lot of variation in environment and mission types but againnew stuff is getting added on a regular basis and the developers are good at their jobs and listen to the community  great for coopplayup to 4players in a squaddifferent outloads and frames can work well together and make things easierand theres plenty of challenges such as survival and endless defense missions with waves of increasingly difficult enemies the community is a mixed bag but still a lot better than most f2p shooters but since it is a freetoplay and literally anyone can pick this up console players youll still see a lot of kidsspamming and allcaps attentionwhoring if you havent played this game i can only recommend you try it outyouve got nothing to lose but potentially a bit or lot of your time^^ its surprisingly good for a free to play and oozing quality

warframe is a different kind of free to play game instead of barraging you with ads or forcing you to buy things you dont want it completely keeps the aspect of a regular monthtomonth or one time pay type of game while some could fight and say its  pay to win i beg to differ while you can use platinum the games currency for real money to game transactions to purchase already made weapons or new characters youre not limited to having to use your money instead you create the items making the game that much better thus the games fun lies within the aspect of creating and gathering materials for items and trying to be the fastest or the strongest tenno the solar system has ever seen anything you can buy you can create it may take a few hours of fighting but then where would the fun in the game be then in summary warframe is a new twist on the f2p game industry by one single characteristic that makes warframe collect most likely the most revenue of any free to play and that is they do not force you to purchase items no one likes being forced into anything  especially not a game and this game one where the devs listen intentively to the players patch things accordingly and make the game all around enjoyable by not making you pay for a monthly subscription or limiting your activites by not paying derserves more respect than it can ever obtain plus  space ninjas 1110

uh not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for pancakes instead ingredients 1 12 cups allpurpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 14 teaspoon salt 18 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 14 cups milk at room temperature 12 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter plus more as needed now to make it 1 in a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg 2 in another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla 3 melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat 4 whisk the butter into the milk mixture add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5 keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 14 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed 6 procedure for adding fruit to pancakes once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings but reallly this is a good game

a very fun free 3rd person scifi action shooter it tends to be fast paced due to the parkour styled movement system similar to mass effect 3s coop multiplayer the difference is mainly in the diverse unique weapons many warframes classes you can choose from and the fast paced parkour movement in the game now the different warframes range from classes which offer a variety style of play whether it be pure damage defense stealth tanking healing crowd control or utility we have warframes that harness  electricity fire wind water ice magnetics antimatter illusions poison sound waves the undead chaos rage based melee fury blades like true ninjas there is so much to choose from and have fun with as far as weapons go this game has some amazing weapons there are hundred of weapons to choose from you can have equipped a primary weapon secondary weapon and a melee weapon you can also unequip primary and secondary weapons and run around in a melee spree deflecting bullets at the same time with your blade weapons range from weapons that shoot ssw blades multishot missile launchers weapons that impale enemies to walls bows that are capable of killing multiple enemies with a single arrow infested rifles that fire electricity toxin launchers kitanas toxic axes that eat through armor greatswords laser rifles and machine guns it is one of my favorite games with that said however it can be grindy and a bit hard to pick up for new players with update 14 coming out it is a bit easier for new players now there is a prologue to help players through the different controls to this game while completing a quest to help ease them into the game while acquiring some beginning mods easily to help increase the damage survivability and many other things of weapons and your warframes the player community and developers are very friendly and release weekly new content along with patches and hot fixes for bugs regularly they are pretty on top of things and keep in mind this game is in the open beta stage which allows the developers to release new content constantly expanding and improving the game allowing the playerbase to evolve with the game itself i would recommend seriously trying this game for a good 1520 hours it is alot of fun and there is not game that is truly like it it is unique and most importantly play with a friendfriends it makes it that much more enjoyable enjoy

warframe is one of the best ftp games i have ever played maybe even the best although there is an option to purchase some items with real money it is not needed you can play the game and unlock everything without spending a dime recently a couple of months ago a huge update came out and made the game even better then it was before in warframe you are an elite ninja alien warrior that can performe badass movements like running on walls sliding backflips and more there a 15 warframes you can play but you have unlock then via blueprints or buying them with platinum in game currency there are many different planets you can unlock by playing the game and beating the levels the are many enviroments ranging from interiors of space ships lush green lands and arctic lands warframe is an amazing game but it may take a little bit of time to master all the different types of jumps and parqor you can do if capable computer to run warframe then there is no reason not to get it

its a very nice futuristic game the appearance of the warframes looks cool the mod system is very awesome and there are so many weapons to choose from dd

an amazing game better than any other shooter ive ever played the game takes direct influence from one of my favorite games dark sector and while the developers insist theres no correlation its hard not to notice the similarities eg glaive tenno excalibur and nyx being blatant copies of the suits nemesis and hayden used in dark sector technocyte virus the list continues admit that this is a sequel and the gamell be better for it warframe gives you the ability to live out your dreams as a superpowered space ninja even if you werent exactly planning to be one youll be happier just for the experience warframe also has tons of replayability and weapons every frame has its own abilites they arent just cosmetic and the number of weapons avaliable to players allows for hundreds of different playstyles from the aspiring ninjas who use bows and other silent weapons to the living tanks who just want to cleave through hordes with a sword taller than they are warframe brings so much to the table even before true release
recommended
for a free to play game you get a lot of content sure if you want to speed up progression and make yourself a little stronger you can spend some cash i havent spent any cash yet but i will soon just to support the devs if you like fps games then give it a try i am having a blast with it

you get more than what you pay for which doesnt say much since you paid nothing you can buy items with real money but it still isnt a p2w and most of those items can be aquired without spending a dime its a good pass time to play an hour here and there it does get repetitive but you cant expect a perfect game when its free and not a p2w

this game is amazing seriously if you havent got it then get it already

you think i got this forma for being slow i got this cause im faaaaast

you ninja things and sometimes win sometimes lose but you lose less when you win and get better and less scrubby and crafting takes a long  time unless you pay monnies you rich person what do you think because you have money youre better than other space zombie ninjas jerk this has been a professional review by me final review score 910 i guess this game is okay

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

i havent played much in this game so my review wont be based on the entire gameplay or story elements i have had only one complaint with the game and it is completely personal opinion in a similar fashion to other multiplayer fps games you can rank up your character to unlock more abilitiespowersgunsetc however in warframe you have to wait 24 hours before you can rank up your first level this means you are stuck using the same crap gear while grinding until you can unlock anything else for at least 24 hours but that isnt my problem i can wait 1 day no biggie i come back the next day to rank up first i have to pass a mission in 60 seconds my newb  fails and now i have to wait another 24 hours annoying i would continue to play and grind using my crap gear but honestly i dont want to that is my only complaint of what little i have experienced of warframe if that doesnt bother you then there are lots of pros to this game such as coop multiplayer tons of variety in character customization intense fast paced fps action technically 3rd person and many others that i didnt get to forcing me into only wanting to play the game for a few minutes every 24 hours just isnt worth my time personally

if youre looking for a good free to play game then look give this a try the game is fun and fast pace yeah you do the same thing over and over but doesnt mean its going to be easy like the last with a tone of warframes to choose from that may fit you best this game isnt connected to the steam friends list so you have to find your friends in the game by asking them what their name is in warframe i doubt this helped or is even a review but i really do think people should at least give this a go also power levels are bull sht

to start off if you arent looking to chop of the alien balls of your interstellar foes then you are in the wrong place gameplay you can kill just about anything anyway youd like the possiblilities are endless and completely up to your decisionmaking skills i cannot explain the endless hours of farming for corpus heads that i have taken beheaded using something called the dakra prime that  already sounds like youd become a stripper to afford second of all ive thrown multiple days at this game to really get that weapon of your dreams doge you get a doge a space doge doge10 42069 or if you are not a doge fanboy then they give you a little companion cube that floats next to you and shoots bullets that eventually will crush the foes at lvl 1 back in the day why you should give sell your soul to the des of warframe this is the question i always get asked and i must enlighten those out there who think this f2p game trend makes the games bad give this game its deserved 100 hours that may feel forever because the start is the hardest it is very limited for beginners and makes it a jagged road to walk on but trust me i dragged my balls across a billion light years of broken glass called t4 to get my first loki prime piece and oh baby the feels were real as the warframes version of cortana announces that im officially a pimp and i should probably go and get me mum and me camera this is worth your time and once you launch off your first good amount of well earned hours that need all your blood sweat and tears you will be so ing addicted and the high will be worth the pain sell your soul

this game this is my new and truly favourite game above team fortress 2 above battlefield 3 not call of duty screw cod and above all else warframe perfects everything  from the advanced tactical and utterly aweinspiring combat to the modification leveling and hub systems to the futuristic soldiersamuraininja guardian of the solar system that you become i have only two problems with the game the parkour for the most part its incredibly badass as you vault over railings and wallrun across chasms before slicing your way through an entire army of corpus soldiers but sometimes its annoying for example one of the grineer maps when you have to do something that takes about six tries to complete fortunately they fixed the specific issue i mentioned by adding a slightly more hidden and far easier passage secondly the crafting system  ive played this game for what 10 hours or so and ive improved my current gear to no end but its rather difficult to craft new weaponry for yourself considering the majority of the things i particularly wanted and hopefully arent even that op were on planets about a lightyear or so away at least it allows you to mod your weapons or warframe so they become pretty damn good even without that new weapon or frame you want all in all id say this is a masterpiece for people who enjoy crysis halo being a power ranger ninjas and others running round the solar system bisecting people shooting at you with a futuristic katana before your teammates massacre the remaining opposing forces masterpiece

recommended
great game for all dogs and more dogs but dogs will dog dogs and dog in the dog woah
recommended
the game is a coop third person shooter but please do not let that turn you away there is a very good reason for this you would probably puke your guts out otherwise the game at times is very fast paced and involves flying through the air climbing up walls running on walls jumping sometimes to great heights sliding spinning around and doing flips had you done this in first person not only would this not look as cool but you would probably not get too far before losing your lunch the best way i can describe it is you are a highly mobile space ninjaspellcastermercenary that can master a plethora of weapons and abilities to complete any mission given to you whether you are eliminating enemies from an area hacking computers defending a point carrying out an assassination capturing a vip or some other mission although the game is a shooter the game lets you be adventurous the maps for each mission are large and have several randomly chosen tile sets as i said before you can climb up walls and often times find alternate routes that may allow you to find hidden goodies or a stealthier route around a group of enemies you can sneak around and be stealthy or rush in guns blazing you also can choose to play solo with friends or with randoms warframe also allows for an unbelievable amount of customization to your spaceship warframes weapons and companions there are many cosmetic items you can use to add to your warframe or switch out parts such as the helmets to get the look you want you can also change the coloring of your gear you start with a small variety of colors but you can buy more color pallets if you wish then there are mods mods give your equipment different perks for example some mods may decrease reload time others may increase damage or your shields there are separate mods for your warframe weapons and companions the mod system gives you more control over how you play and fine tune your gear to make it more powerful there are literally hundreds of mods in this game to choose from there are also plenty of primary secondary and melee weapons to choose from each weapon has its own damage spread for different types of physical and elemental damage they do some types of damages are better against different types of enemies the good 1sounds  although its space and sound should not be as well pronounced as it is in the game the sounds in my opinion are great 2customization  as i said there is plenty of it 3new content  new content for this game comes out every month so there is always something worth looking at 4events  there are many events that pop up in the game as well as in the forums you can enter a contest to win platinum cash shop currency or do the in game alerts for rare items and special challenges such as tactical alerts 5not pay to win  this game is absolutely not pay to win it is pay to get cosmetics or to skip grinding or waiting for some things many players trade in game items for plat so you can get cash shop items without spending a dime if youre a wheeler and dealer you can also gift items too 6clan dojo  clan dojos your clans private base give you access to items you cannot get in the normal market and give you a place to trade items and parkour courses you can run through also the dojos just look flipin sweet you can also get an observatory which looks beautiful as well 7exp rate  i honestly thing the exp gain rate is not bad yes if you are formaing a weapon for end game it takes a while depending on what you do but it is not really all that bad you do not need to dedicate months to this game to get somewhere 8solomultiplayer you can play by yourself with friends or with random players if you want you can control this in your options 9content  there is a lot of different types of missions and modes you can play 10playerbase  there is always a lot of players online even in off hours 11pvp mode  there is a pvp mode that they recently revamped 12story and lore  there is a lot of lore involving this game that helps explain why the solar system is the way that it is there are also side story quests you can do after completing the main story quest line 13syndicates  syndicates are factions in the game there are perks for joining them such as access to items you cannot get anywhere else it also adds another mechanic in that enemy factions will send squads to attack you randomly which adds to the tension and the danger of the world 14archwings  it can be fun flying around in space do a barrel roll the bad 1glitches  easily the number one issue with this game this game has more glitches than any game i have ever played in my life and that is saying a lot 2constant patching  an hour or two if even after new content is released a hotpatch is released to fix what they broke then there are consecutive hotpatches to fix what was fixed each hotfix requires you exit the game and relaunch this kind of sucks if youre about to do something and getting your party organized 3trading  you cannot trade until you reach mastery rank 4 and then you are limited in how many times you can trade daily you also need a dojo to trade 4obtaining cosmetics and colors  most color pallets are obtained by spending platinum the same goes for most of the cosmetics 5kubrows  if it dies it likes you less and then you have to pet it to make it not hate you as it hates you more it does less damage oh you can only pet it three times a day to make it happy it also degrades over time this means you need to buy these expensive dna stabilizers to keep it alive every day your kubrow will lose 10% of its condition gauge which also decreases its total health which causes it to die more which causes it to hate you and do less damage yes it comes full circle ladies and gentlemen 6lack of archwing content  there just is not a lot 7lack of warframe and weapon slots  if you want more than two warframes you need to play platinum for additional slots the same goes for weapon slots fortunately they start you off with some platinum which you can use to buy slots if you want rating if i were to rate it now i would give it an 810 i would probably want to give it a 910 but with all the glitches and patching i cant honestly give it a higher rating i understand de is not necessarily a huge group and they are good about patching things up but gameplay is still gameplay and that is what i am rating it is also hard to rate warframe due to the fact the game is not complete new content is added monthly and it is still in beta for now i feel 810 is quite fair i also would like to note i am not big into buying game currency in games i am on a budget and i do not normally feel games deserve my hard earned cash however i did not mind giving them some of my money because i love the game i want it to keep going and i feel like that later on down the road there will be something to show for it recommendation which leave one last question would i recommend this game yes i would this game has elements that would attract fps and tps players as well as people who like mmosrpg players and possibly anyone else even if you do not normally like shooters you may love this game for example i have a buddy that hates shooters but loves the elder scrolls games and guild wars 2 i got him playing this and now he is on it every day even if you do not like guns you can still hack and slash your foes apart you also do not have to be hardcore about the game to get anywhere if you have questions feel free to ask me in here or add me on steam or in game agentice it was longer but character limitations thank you for reading

grind grind grindpay to win warframe starts initially as a fun advanced space ninja game and gradually descended into pure madness whilst the game is incredibly fun to play mission wise progression is all based on grinding farming resources and waiting waiting waiting unless you pay even more money to have that ridiculous 3 day weapon build time done right now however the abilities design and detail of the game is lovely it truly sticks to a scifi theme without becoming terrible like cough cough some other games ive reviewed pvp is not reccomended nearly every player who has spent money on high tier weapons can quite easily to put lightly destroy you strangely though i do reccomend that you play this game as with friends its incredibly fun and makes for a very good time outside of pvp and clans besides of course space ninja

this game is a pretty good coop game but expect money used on it this game is going to be harder as it goes on so grab some friends

best f2p there is for me  not trully free though but it doesnt demand you to pay 4050 euros so you can proceed with game  just with 510 euros you can access almost everything in the game  and there is lot content is added frequently with lots of updates either big or small i recommend this game hands down if you can play this with friends then even better

overtheshoulder fps with robot ninjas in space i personally love going around getting stuff to craft new weapons and warframes only limitation to f2p players is that you have limited inventory space and platinum is mostly used to cut down the grinding and waiting process to build stuff and cosmetics

ninja space pirate bounty hunter crysis suit fun this game is thoroughly enjoyable with alot of replayability with various warframe to try and level with a indepth user interface and modding system this is not a pay to win game you only have to pay if you wish to further your enjoyment of the game this game has earned what little money i have spent on it so far with 80 hours of game time within a week i am hooked and i have manged to make a warframe and duel pistols which i could pay for but instead i played to earn the required parts this game is awesome it looks great and plays great and its only in beta minor issues arise every now and then but i expect those will be handled before the complete release get yo  in this game

this is in my opinion an awsome coop game with alot of features i love the concept of you being an alienninjarambo badass that sneaks onto the enemy and by sneak i mean you charge head first and blast everything in range however i must say that its not flawless i found that in the begining it was hard to get into the game to really get a hold of the controls modding and parkour actions if there maby was an optional extended tutorial maby this would help the new players get into the game faster i also really think this game needs more variation between maps and missions because othervise the game will get repedetive and after that uninstresting perhaps side missions inside the real mission maby something like collecting something from fallen enemies another thing i thought would be intresting is if the game could expand its story maby tell the tale of who the tenno were before sht hit the fan or how the diffrent warframes were created warframe has already given us some intel on who the tenno were why not more i think alot of people would enjoy something like that and just one last thing make it so that you can only buy cosmetic stuff for platinum the payable fee its really getting on my nerve that i sometimes have to delete a warframe just so i can have another just beacause i dont have the spare money to pay seriously stop it othervise a good game that i think everybody should atleast try it wont cost you anything p

warframe is a coop based thirdperson shooter set in a futuristic universe where you play as the tenno a race of reawakened warriors that are sustained in these suits called warframes and begin clearing out the solar system of threats such as the grineer a race of xenophobic clones that hate everything thats not a grineer including the tenno then you have corpus a unified profit organisation that seeks to make profit and kill everything that stops them from making profit and then you have infestations that are organic lifeforms that seek to spread and infect the solar system warframe is one of the most polished f2p games ive ever played and heres why the gameplay is fastpaced fun and overall just awesome i love slicing and dicing and pinning my foes to the wall the different warframes you have which are the suits the tenno you wear add many ways to playing you have a wide range of weapons to use as well which ill list below swords pistols assault rifles axes staffs hammers shotguns bows crossbows sniper rifles rocket launchers revolvers machine pistols also you have sentinels and kubrow which are companions that act as a support role that help you during missions there are different types of sentinels and kubrows that have different stats and abilities so in that sense youd pick the one that suits your playstyle outside of missions youre on your ship even though when this game came out it was just a menu screen you had the ship feature came in later anyway you have your navigation system which lets you select which planet you wanna go to and do some missions youll also get daily events which you receive rewards for completing you have other components on the ship like the foundry for crafting the arsenal for all your equipment the comms for additional features the mods segment for combining and upgrading mods and the incubator for keeping your kubrow in graphically speaking its a very good looking game especially for f2p standards the particle effects the lighting the colors the overall attention to detail is impressive the aesthetic of warframes universe is very flashy very colorful and very pretty sound is pretty good too music is alright weapon sound ambient noise and the voice acting is pretty solid as for story usually most f2p games dont really interest me in the story aspect or atleast i hadnt found one yet but this game gets pretty interesting when you start digging up the lore from the codexes wiki pages or even forums or videos that delve into the mythos of warframe its good so far but it still needs to be more fleshed out and built upon more what i gave on the first paragraph was really just the background story a brief and very basic explanation of what warframes about and what youre doing warframe is like i said a coop game you do have the option to play on your own but unless youre equipped to do so youre better off grouping with friends or other people because thats when the experience is at its best in my opinion there is pvp despite it not being the main focus of the game i personally havent touched it yet but maybe at some point i will all i know is that you can do 1v1 duels in the dojo and dark sector conflicts where clans fight for territory but still the addition of pvp is a good thing regardless it adds more replay value to the game itself warframe is one of the few games in the f2p market thats not necessarily p2w alot of the things you get in the market you can craft without ever spending a dime in the game credits are your main currency and is what lets you buy some weapons that allow you to pay with credits blueprints which lets you craft things from warframes weapons items etc platinum is a currency that you aquire by using your money to buy things outright instead of crafting them but like i stated you dont have to spend money to get anywhere in this game you can get almost everything from crafting whilst it may take longer in the end youll still have that item you want ever since warframes release the game has been getting better and better with new updates new weapons new warframes new events etc theres always a reason to go back and the regular updates and its great gameplay is one of the reasons why this game is so popular recently the archwing update came which brought in space combat which is a huge stepup in the progression of developing this game further hell maybe at one point they might even allow you to literally fly your ship around the solar system and not just walk in it in the end you have one of the best f2p games in recent memory that has a strong developement team digital extreme that constantly improves the game a big community and a fair f2p model yes it is grindy yes it is repetitive but it is also rewarding and fun at the same time
recommended
this game is one of the best free to plays out there i mean like look at the devs they are constantly working their butts off i give them my utmost respect to them after every update the update is as big as the previous or more putting the previous update to shame as the current one is so much better the devs do livestream like every week which is really really good as you know the saying the customer is always right they have suggestions from people playing it whatsup and all its just beautiful its still in beta i dont know when they are going to release it to a game but i can see it has a bright bright future gameplay is sweet parkour ninja swords and all archwing basically you becoming gundam fighters you dont need to spend a lot of money on this as the game wants you to work for it but if you want to spend money on it just buying an item costs a lot so you want to play smart 1010 in my opinion the best f2p other than dota2 or tf2 because they are competitive but this is not pure cooperation pvp is not much in this fun with friends and all

well i lost some items for god know why they just desapear from the air even toght the game rocks its awesome on every way you will love it more and more the time goes by and if you get into a clan you will form strong bonds with your guild mates or so i hope xd the game has a way to let you decide how to play close combat long distance middle battle guns bows swords claws daggers etc and every frame has his own and freaking cool powers witch you will need to choose carefully since the frame is the one that deteremine how you will play a very recommended game chears

was cold on this one during beta but a friend got me to look again its a mightly good fun experience theres no real depth here but there is also nothing quite like it anywhere else its a fun brainless coop brawler  and its rather good its fast paced and thrilling its freetoplay so you can expect microtransactions  but you know i actually prefer that business model these days recommended
recommended
great game 1010 stars reccomend to all friends  p

i really love this game it has a destiny feel but its much more advanced and built for people who know their way around a keyboard like only a pc gamer would also has that open pc feel we all love

warframe in all its naked glory is a good game now great but not eh i mean its better than team fortress 2 but not better than skyrim somewhere in between i mean its cool cuz you can be a friggin space ninja but more than half the levels youre gonna play are set in some space station oh and enemies are total bulletsponges however i do recommend this game because lets say youre sitting around on a rainy day you be like hey man im bored warframe will eat up your time like it was never even there slightly pay 2 win but if you put your mind to it you can access all of the features like new warframes armor find blueprints find components make some crap use that crap to kill stuff use the stuff you find on the stuff that was killed to make more crap the circle of life

when you hear the words freetoplay thirdperson shooter you probably envision yet another pvp killfest with a frightening potential for paytowin microtransactions warframe then is a pleasant surprise its a fourplayer coop shooter in the vein of mass effect 3 multiplayer with fastpaced action and plenty of customizable options except without the story context like all too many recently launched freetoplay games at the moment technically open beta but declared reviewable it feels somewhat buggy and unfinished but it holds the promise of what might be a great game after a few more content patches being a coop game doesnt mean that you have to ignore a competent storyline see left 4 dead but warframe seems content to establish its universe at a basic level players are acrobatic robotsuited warriors fighting an alien invasion then it simply throws us into a long series of very sameyfeeling missions whether youre asked to rescue a hostage or retrieve an alien artifact or destroy a reactor rest assured that your primary goal is to shoot nighendless waves of enemies its good then that warframe makes it quite fun to kill things and watch them die movement and shooting feels smooth and responsive targets are plentiful and theres just enough ragdoll silliness in the enemy death animations to always make me look forward to my next kill theres a good variety of guns to choose from including a powerful bow that can pin enemies to walls and although the scifi swordsman archetype might be overplayed lately the melee combat here is also satisfyingly weighty charged attacks that can slice enemies clean in half are their own reward animations in general are fluid and interesting and although the environments tend toward blandness theyre lit up by a technicolor explosion of enemy fire and player ability effects some tweaking is required the bloom effects are fairly ridiculous at their default setting but this is still one of the bestlooking freetoplay games to date warframe runs on digital extremes proprietary evolution engine which does a fine job of both looking great and running smoothly the primary fodder of warframe are the grineer a race of privateer space marines that do a passable job of taking cover and attempting to retreat or advance as the situation demands however theyll also regularly send out seeker bots which are by far the most annoying enemies ive fought lately due to their small hitboxes and extremely rapid movement meanwhile the infested race read space zombies are almost exclusively melee attackers and i found i could usually reduce them to confused immobility simply by standing on a tall box standing on top of boxes is just one of the abilities of these hightech super soldiers each of the three warframe classes gets a suite of four unique superpowers volt relies on electrical attacks nyx uses psychic powers to turn enemies against each other loki becomes invisible for stealth attacks and so on those abilities are fun to use but the downside is that you wind up unlocking all of them fairly early on some advanced superpowers at the upper end of the level curve wouldve been a nice reward for sticking with a single suit also any of the three warframe classes can use any gun which is understandable given that you might be paying real money for them but it makes them feel interchangeable when it comes to shooting speaking of guns the lack of grenades and other explosive options is a bit odd but it did at least force me to move forward to engage enemies behind cover rather than bogging things down in protracted longdistance firefights you can sneak up behind some enemies and perform backstabs to critically wound them but in the chaos of a fourperson mission i found that stealth usually goes by the wayside fairly quickly most customization comes from an extensive modification system in which you plug in collected upgrades like elemental damage to your weapons and extra shields to your warframe the interface for this system still needs a fair amount of work though i ran into a nasty bug that completely prevented me from switching mods out on one of my warframes and in fact required a complete game restart every time i attempted to do so plus the random nature of the drops can also be frustrating if you miss out on the basic shield and health boosters you might find yourself needing to rerun early missions until you get some lucky drops as theyre almost required to complete later missions one of warframes significant issues at the moment is its failure to display important information especially in the missionselect interface its a slick piece of work letting you pick where you want to go in the system in a cool way but the level ranges of each individual planet arent shown making you click around until you find somewhere appropriate to play likewise games in progress are marked but you have no idea of the relative level of the players involved until you actually join a game in progress since there isnt an quickmatch button i had to go through a fair amount of planetbrowsing each time i wanted to hop into a match and false starts are a drag theres always the option to simply hop into a mission by yourself and hope that someone joins you but some missions arent wellbalanced for solo play some require you to carry an item that prevents you from firing your main weapon others consist of defending critical points from enemies attacking from multiple angles running out of ammo is also a concern when youre outnumbered this badly most critically theres no lag or ping display anywhere given warframes reliance on peertopeer connections its frustrating not to know whether youre about to hop into a game hosted by someone whos streaming hd movies from netflix in the other room i ran into latency problems that ranged from noticeable to almost unplayable in around a quarter of the games i joined as with most freetoplay games warframe contains a store where you can exchange realworld money for one of the two ingame currencies platinum there isnt much in the cashonly store that could be considered mandatory although some of these items like the ingame pets that stun and shoot nearby enemies additional daily revives and powerboosting items that let you slot in twice as many mods to your frame and weapons could be classed as very very handy still the economy feels fair especially since youre only paying to be able to kill ai enemies more efficiently youll also earn the other currency credits as you play and the market does a reasonable job of ensuring that most items aside from things like xp boosters and slots for extra warframes can be purchased with them theres an extra laborious crafting hurdle for free players but its not tedious to the point of frustration i spent $50 to buy 1000 platinum with which i was able to buy a bundle consisting of a new warframe three new weapons and a set of boosters which made earning xp and credits much quicker for a few days with enough platinum left over to purchase another warframe and a weapon or two for perspective it wouldve taken at least a few days of regular play not counting crafting time which is often on the order of 12 hours per item to earn the credits to buy them all in its current state warframe feels like the foundation or frame you might say of a game that might be really interesting at some point in the future it just needs more of everything more mission variety more good enemies more polish more environments more players given the cost warframes well worth a try if like this ambient

this reminds off unereal tornument just way better and whit alor wok you can have alot off funn in the whit difrent mods planets whit missions toons of weapons and the more you play the more awzomenes whill happen to you this is defently i recomend playing just you need to play moe then 10h before the games opns more upp abd they add new conntienent pritty often and pach eatch week and whit new stuff and you dont have to buy money in the gane you find better items and items you can sell later on to get even more stuff

recommended
41  5 24 hours logged in 2 weeks i didnt give it 5 stars because its not a free to play game its a free to play demo the quality is preemo but the development costs must be paid somehow which means you are going to have to invest some money if you want to keep enjoying this game the demo version gets a bit repeaditive and i personally need some more convincing as to the glory that platinum can unlock i put some pretty good farm time in but the rewards lacked luster if you arent afraid to spend some money on a game then this one could offer some great coop fragging but if you are looking for free to play dont expend to stay engaged for that long

ok game would play agaibnba

space ninjas seriously though if you like 3rd person shooters with a mix of swordplay then this is the game for you 910

its a fun game but it has many issues important downlad from warframe website and not steam when you first download it it gets around 6 gigs of data then when you launch it it patches the game so if you try to verify or backup the game you lose all fiels and it will donload the 6 gigs again and then patch it again save yourself some headache and download the game from the warframe website i gave it a thumbs up cuz its a good game but man i had to download this game 3 times already and that is not fun
recommended
iv been playing since closed beta and even now it still keeps me entertained and enjoyable and there are updates almost every week giving us new content and the major updates often keep you busy for a few weeks
recommended
this is one of the best free to play games currently on the planet beautiful graphics stunning gameplay and the best part you dont have to pay a cent unless you really want to
recommended
this game is by far the most detailed free game to play truly remarkable graphics and with each update it only gets better but there two aspects i would like to bring to the players who would like to play warframe 1 the game severly punishes you if you truly wish to enjoy the game as it will force you to play for many many hours to get new warframe and weapons 2 although a game that does force you to play a long time i must say the player community is the most helpful and fun than that i have experienced in any game yet so making friends to help you gather the stronger weapons can be much more fun eventually ending up with something more valuable than those top tier weapons a friend x3 anyway i hope you enjoy the game the game of warframe

this game is amazing it has good graphics even though it gets no lagg on the worst computer the fighting in the game is good and so is every thing else dowload this game
recommended
one of the best games i have ever played honestly i am surprised that this is a free to play game everything can be earned for free by building them using blueprints or you can spend alot of money on an ingame currency called platinum and buy everything that you wantbut that would be exspensive being a free game they have to make money somehow i would highly reccomend getting this game if you have a good computer or check it out for free on the playstation 4 aswell
recommended
really enjoy this game i wasnt expecting to like it when it was suggested to me by a friend but its great

a great coop freetoplay beware this game requires a lot of patience due to the consistent farming but its still amazing to play

just started playing this and its not to bad its quit entertaining love the bow

its a game where you play as a powerful space ninja warrior often you can feel extreemly powerful fighting off loads of enemies sadly one thing you have to get used to is to keep moving so you cant stay in one place and get shot to death your not playing as a tank in this game but still a very powerful space ninja oh did i mention space ninjas yeah space ninjas

first i would like to thank the devs for their beautifull hard work on this game i started this game when it came out and it was  meh fun and fast paced but repetitive and boring after a few games since then the devs have been hard working every single update they did closed their flaws optimised and unplayable game braught it to an extreme content filled world remade the ui braught thousands of bonus to player and even after the game was branded pay to win after a few updates it felt as if it was already a thing of the past if you feel like playing a game that is  fast paced  encourage either full out assault and stealth  single and multiplayer experience  challenging gameplay hard to master  hundreds of weapon  full crafting system  unlimited replay  dozens of character to play with and unlock  a good community and the best of all devs that freakin listen to player p this game will be for you and for those who say the game is missing stuff or not to your liking tell the devs and stay patient ive never seen anything not getting fixed since the start of this game  have fun and see you inside tenno d

fun mature actionadventure instancebased mmo the way mods artifacts weapons powers and pets are used upgraded and synergize is very complex and rewarding things like mods actually make a very large and noticable effect on the way you play the game this combined with twenty different frames and dozens of weapons makes for a very diverse game warning public matches are ok for the first few hours of gameplay but a friend or three is crucial for enjoying the mid to late game grinding can be a thing occasionally consider joining a clan

if you are having second thoughts on weather you should get this game let me end it for you by saying that you should everything about this game is extremely fun and entirely possible for any player yes you can spend money to get things such as weapons or warframes but the only things you have to spend money on are completely cosmetic things such as colors and scarves yes you will have to grind to get things in this but if you have friends to play this with or take every combat situation as something new it doesnt even feel like grinding it feels like playing and like fun and even though the mission have limited types the amazing devolopers are always adding new things to keep the game fresh and new even if they didnt though a mission could change completely based on what lotus your contact on everything going on thinks you should do or your own actions on other missions and then there are weapons you can only get if your in a clan you can still get them even if you dont get into a huge and powerful clan i know this because i am in a clan with one other active player and have 23 of the weapons and warframes researched trust me when i say it you will love this game just look at my hours on it hell ill even help you out if you need it just message me see you in the stars tenno

warframe is a fun game but it gets very redundant repetitive very quickly dont take this the wrong way graphics are cool and it doesnt lag my bad computer some tasks get repetitive though repeating the same mission to get a part for a weapon blah blah blah its still fun even for newcomers 710 would play again

my game is crashing for no reason any body know why

recommended
action packed game never a dull moment the game always has new typpes of missions to do and its a four person co op you can buy new characters to play as and each one is unique in its own way
recommended
the easiest and most accurate way to put this game is this ninjas in space literally you are a ninja in a suit of armor but not power armor thats different also imagine the ninjas almost have none of their actually only important quality stealth yup literally the moment people see you and you shoot at them you are detected and cannot revert to a stealth gameplay if you want a stealth game warframe isnt for you plain and simple if you want stealth play skyrim or alpha protocol the game lags in short bursts and consistently for me regardless of what graphics settings i use theres no way to optimize the graphics settings in the game or set it to preset quality modes all weapons and even the character itself levels up but thats no big deal as ratchet and clank did it way before steam was even an idea before halflife 2 or 1 pretty much this game has had a rather large amount of love poured into it but the fact levels do not have any secrets in it otherwise known as those things you found in duke nukem 3d doom and the first two quake games that the game would then call you out on makes me rather sad some things id recommend adding into the game are a way to improve the stealth aspects of this game some people may want to be an actual ninja in space instead of a kungfu cowboy who jsut shoots things people can just play planetside 2 if they wanna shoot things only maybe a way to passively detect the viewing direction of enemies for sure a better way to move the camera none of this stupid overtheshoulder crap or atleast give us an option to change the default and set camera mode make invisibility less of a crappy invisibility or name it to crappy cloak instead because a 10 second thnig of invisibility isnt even really useful as you have to stand up and get spotted to use it in the first place maybe make it so that the tutorial in the menu part is skippable part of palying games is discovery i ing hate it when my hand is held forcefully as if im 12 in a damn video game sorry but i beat quake 2 on all difficulties no problem i beat alter echo twice the hardest game of the golden age era of games im seriously sure i can handle everything this game has to offer thats not saying ill actually see it as thi game cant keep me interested enough i dont like playing this game for the above reasons most of them too great to ignore in my mind yes i recommend warframe if you want to have a scifi action shooter with acrobatics cough ut3 cough and a terribly small stealth aspect which then forces you to play offensive run and gun so yes play warframe if you can enjoy a shooter game that has no secrets to find automatically making it pretty much the equivalent of forced artistic expression soulless atleast put some ing puzzles into the game and not  ones like duke nukem 3d did with the button combinations which were pretty awesome at the time but nowadays we can do so much more i give this game a 310 overall 810 for appearance which is the smallest factor in the history of games when it comes to the relation of games to how fun they are to paly and for gameplay i give it a 410 may be a bit harsh but i want to see shooters with a puzzle element something to make the player think more than one might think while playing metroid prime 2

addicting and fun but maybe be boring after u have done everythinggreat game though d
recommended
an annoying grindfest where people with their moms credit card outdo you anyways only redeeming feature is the models animation is poor and the menus are garish the stability of the servers provided are laughable at best and can make it almost unplayable the way upgrades work are limited and poorly assembled with very little to actually incentivize more play warframe gets a 100100 a  this game

really fun game if you like being a ninja from outer space kind of like start trek get it

a very good strat game lots of loot weapons and warframes charecters 455

why do i have 1000 hours in this terrible game
recommended
as addictive as dota 2
recommended
this game has change a lot by updates with the most recent update being a major change to the user interface for the good with the new quest system allows a more friendly intro in the game without being overwhelmed by all the content in the game and includes more narrative into the game so it is no longer only played for its gameplay however only slightly becuase the quest system in new but will improve over time with updates the game is free to play but i recomemed you spend some money on this game about the same amount you would pay for a normal game becuase you will find yourself having a hard time getting on your feet in this game with equipment but do not buy weapons or warframes directly with plat becuase it is really expensive and you can better get them through blueprints and gathering the materials to build them instead the reason for buying plat is to get on your feet and super charge your equipment making them twice as powerful for mod collecting mods the things you use to upgrade your equipment you can go to the trading tab but only for rare mods that you really want or need otherwise just get them from the game overall this game has improve over time and will continue to do so so if you find yourself unsatisfied with the game you may find it more entertaning with future updates

nice game it is a nice concept it was fun when i played it during the start of it but i cant play it right now sadly i wish it was on other platforms as well

warframe is a realy awesome and unique game the creators thought this game through for sure the way that they combine the old fashioned weapons meele weapons and the new fashioned weapons primary and secondary is fantastic the veriaty of power ups which are know as modifications or mods is huge i couldnt count them all weapons have a huge veriaty as well the warframes of this game are about 20 not a lot but its pretty hard to aquire all of them i shall not explain any more the rest is up to you to discover good luck tenno
recommended
great game just needs a deathmatch
recommended
definitely a fun and addicting game you start off having just come out of cryostasis after that from what ive played of it so far you are sent straighht into battle your character is somewhat similar to alien space ninja with upgradeable helmets shaped similar to shark fins the gameplay is amazing the graphics are better than most games ive played and the game is literally action packed definately a 1010 in my opinion i would definately recomend this to all who action packed scifi style games
recommended
of course i do i spent so many hours playing this game its tons of fun 3
recommended
the game started off very fun with it having some pretty solid combat but unfortunately that can only get you so far it ended up being the way of vindictus the combat was amazing but the content was lacking all the stages are pretty much the same and it gets extremely repeatative rather quickly however for some people it could be something new and fun to play
recommended
what can i say god damn this is so cool

this game i can only suggest to certain people its fun for some but a grind for others it is free to play yes but in order to get new gear to use you have to go to different planets to look for parts this is where the grind part of this game can come in because as it is not a fully finished game the variety in the maps is stilllacking but the fast paced hyper active combat can make up for that if thats your styleits personally the reason ive almost clocked 200 hours in this game i will point out that the weapons and new warframes you can aquire are definetely unique from one another and that throws in enough variety on that front to keep you interested as long and you get the parts needed to build them with out throwing in the towel and quitting before hand so yes all in all its fun theres fast paced ninja combat variety in combat styles and gear but there is the grind of getting those new items without spending real money to aquire them quickly
recommended
its fun original and beautiful grafix
recommended
this is a really fun game and one of the best free to play games ive played its meant to be played cooperatively so try it out with a friend its free so theres no risk in giving it a shot

this game is really fun to play with you friends there is a stealth aspect to the game which i love and youre able to go in guns blazing aswel

its a radical game about space ninjas goin round killin stuff its not p2w everybody has the same resources available paying or not so dont let others talk you into that though the game is a bit of a grind at times search x for insert resource andor blueprint here and build up the credits to create what you want rng is a total hack but dont let that water down your fun overall its a nice game to play with friends or by yourself money will make the game easier though you dont have to at all
recommended
quite possibly one the greatest freetoplay games on the market the community is decent the graphics are dazzling and the combat is explosive however this game loses its appeal once the equipment and character acquisition grind come into play all characters and weapons are craftable however paytowin is a very viable option unfortunately with crafting times varying from 1 day to 3 days for each piece let alone the actual multiple piece item the environments are recycled and lose their shine after a while though it really doesnt detract from the game seeing as how it fits the clonepiratezombie storyline overall a superb game until you hit the equipment wall
recommended
what more can you say but  must download  must play best f2p 3
recommended
amazing game but be prapared for lag if your on a lower end system

warframe was a different game for me i usually dont play online third person shooters or any online shooter for that matter the game had a interesting setup i liked the fact that this game has a lot of customization on weapons however the game has quite a few issues first of all this game is heavy pay to win crafting in this game takes a lot of time 12 hours for weapons and a lot of credits in game currency however people who pay for the game can just buy these weapons from the start people who pay can also buy additional warframes from the start which have to be crafted it is very difficult to do by non paying members non paying members are also limited in even the basic colors of their warframe they are only given a tiny fraction of colors that didnt include black which bothered me since its one of my favorite colors that are honestly not that good with the exception of a few as for gameplay itself it seemed to have good mechanics i liked the fact that you can beat a level with stealth to avoid fighting masses of enemies best done solo with loki warframe weapon balance seemed good combat is fast paced fluid and full of action live action and several different ways to use melee attacks along with awesome jumps had me at times just messing around with the controls for fun the game feels kind of disconnected between players though throughout my time playing this game very few players would talk to me and honestly there wasnt much to talk about the game also has very repetetive maps while i understand making a unique map for every single level would be impossible throughout my time playing i only saw three maps an underground cave a base on a icy planet and a warship the individual sections are also repetitive by one or two playthroughs of each map you will have seen almost every section there is it would be nice to see a unique design for every world which i think is possible the missions themselves are highly repetative i found myself doing the same thing over and over again with few alterations some new mission types should be added to the game to curb its repetetive feel in the end if you are going to play this game as a dedicated player be ready to fork out some money because my f2p run of this game had me leaving by the time i finished mars some improvments that i think would help the game create at least three unique maps for each world get a world chat lobby to connect the players a little more make demos for weapons so we know what the gun is like before we go through the trouble of getting them and add some new missions to make the game less repetetive well there is my review
recommended
very fun kind of confusing at first but once you know what you are doing it is awesome
recommended
i have played warframe alot and i can tell you that if you like shooters you will love this game most free to play games i have played are really bad or are pay to win but warframe is not warframe has a system were if you want to pay to get things quicker you can but almost everything that you can pay to get you can get without spending anything and the stuff you do have to pay for are mostly cometic warframes combat system is very good and fun to play with becuase there is a weapon or tool for almost every play style out there the people who make warframe seem to care very much about there game and what people think of it and have a content update every week and a big update every few weeks one thing i wish warframe had more of is story and i think that that is pretty much the only thing that is lacking in warframe but do not worry because the devs are making meny updates to the story and lore warframe is a very fun and very well made game and i think that if you like shooters you will love this game
recommended
the upsides are simple this games aesthetic is amazing tenno look cool everything they do looks cool player actions and stuff are cool and dome helmets the story is ambiguous enough to be open to whatever players interpretive powers might allow and it doesnt get in the way you have guns and you shoot things you have swords and you hit things navigation is almost never an issue and teamwork is smooth and easy pace is generally pretty fast and thus things dont get stale as quickly the downsides are also simple buggy as hell this being free to play everything that isnt basic xy or z costs dollars or a lot of time especially aesthetic stuff grinding is not too bad but still present networking can be awful at times and occasionally nonexistant teamwork is not a necessity having a team is as the game doesnt seem to be balanced even remotely for less than the typical complement of 4 players without being laughably easy
recommended
very easy game to play if you ignore all the grinding and damage calculations and grinding and endless grinding but its a very fun game mixes shooter with parkourish mechanics
recommended
this is hands down one of the most addicting games ive played in a long time 20 minutes turns into 5 hours easy you wont be disappointed
recommended
fully f2p game  theres no way you can win this with p2w tons of content and customization to use your creativity just try it  this game is full of action and unforgettable experience
recommended
warframe is an online coopshooter which slightly reminds me of a mix of halo story  setting and mirrors edgemoveability and gameplay style this combo results in lots of excitement and possibilities and a lot of fun while playing you can go on pve missions all around our solar system and even a bit outside of it or play pvp in consortium the matchmaking is cool you can even set the max ping you want to be matched with even if you play without your friends you will be automatically assigned to squads going onto the same mission there are a few bugs which might force you to shut down the game only occured in menu but remember its free and its in beta so wtf do you want d it is a freetoplay title with in my opinion exemplary handling of paying gamers you can only speed up your advance getting new warframes and equipment through paying real money if you are nonpayer you can farm everything on your own and get the newest warframes too which is perfect as i want to play a game to get the good stuff so you got a lot to do the only thing im not sure about is warframeweapon slots you will need to purchase them for real money if you want to have more than 2 warframes or 8 weapons at a time warframe slots cost 20 platinum and weapon slots cost 6 platinum the smallest platinum buying pack costs 449 and gets you 75 platinum so at the worst real money to platinum rate one warframe slot costs around 120 the only really bad thing i noticed its pretty adictive especially in the beginning eg after getting your first warframe part
recommended
much good very play wow so violence much recommend explosyon wow
recommended
this thing id pay for this and its for free its too well made to be true
recommended
the boss game
recommended
is entertaining but gets repetitive 610
recommended
gameplay 710 story 510 based on lore online 710 very p2w pay to win you can buy everything and they even have donor deals that give you more elite items for giving over $100 never the less this game is fun to play with friends or online just make sure you have a decent internet connection since it is still beta there a few glitcheslike flinging yourself across the map but they are more wtf was that and dont destroy the gameplay most of the weapons you want are also craftable for mostly resonable resources and in game cost so p2w slightly balances out for weapons the different warframes and difficult to get so either be prepaired to fork over some cash to get the one you want or grind for the resources you need to make it the warframe you start out with is prefectly viable and works so they arent forcing you to p2w online is decent people a generally very nice though not often helpful whether though lack of knowledge or lack of input except lag issues though especially with lots of other people i only recommend this because it is free and you dont have to pay to have decent items to play with
recommended
pretty good it is pay to get better wepons but the wepons they give u at the start are not horrible you can just upgrade ur default weps the make em as good as the others
recommended
i completely admite this game although i do not enjoy the multiplayer i always have to 34 minutes for one person to catch up in order for us to complete the mission
recommended
this lady told me to go in a room where i then proceeded to be hit in the face with a knive by a guy 1010 would get hit in the face with a knive by a guy again
recommended
a very well made game suprisingly made by a small dev team but has become widely recognized to the point of a console release which is a great feat even if it is download only great game and more stuff being added to it
recommended
its a fun and beautiful game but the only problems are its ftp which means micro transactions said purchaseable items are needed for the more difficult levels as free items are weak or take forever to acquire you need to level every new weapon you acquire there will be areas or missions where you will need a full team play when you have nothing else to play or do
recommended
a lot of effort put into this free game and its pretty fun
recommended
super rad poured time into it for no good reason
recommended
this is one of my favorite games not only is it a mmo that focuss on coop but its also a fps too my knowledge theres no games quiet like this a space ninja with amazing powers yep no place like home <3 xoxo

it makes me poop really hard

fun shooty i suggest playing it in short burst so it does not become too repetitive
recommended
extremely fun and good free to play game everything can be acessed without money
recommended
i tried to stomach this game the videos looked good they really do look fun i downloaded jumped into a game with friends and could not stomach close to 1hour it really is boring it does nothing all you do is go from one room to another swinging your sword around that is it graphics are decent with smooth flowing but that is all it has going for it lucky to hell it is free because if this had a price i think i would pull my hair out requesting a refund urgently because it is mind numbingly boring i suggest leaving it alone maybe give it ago but then youll see what i mean it has no story most things are buy for better stuff but it all seems to do the same effect the character moves weird and makes me feel sick a little anyway nope not for me
recommended
its left 4 dead with space ninjas and a side of rpg
recommended
very fun game i suggest you try it
recommended
its cool and all but it gets repetitive when you grind to level up and the missions are intense too so you cant enter like a level 5 mission as level 2 gotta grind which is stupid from the linear maps
recommended
game os quite fun but gets a little repetative need new things to be added as the game progressis tp keep intresting
recommended
like skyrim with guns
recommended
great f2p a bit addictive though
recommended
this is a great and crazy fun game to play the learning curve is a much at first but once you have a few hour in this game you are hooked the design and game game is wonderful the frames to pick from or obtain offer everyone something speical to them and the style of game play you would enjoy the dev are always releasing new content and items i like that this is not a 5 hour game and then on the something else this game is something you will enjoy for months and never look back give it a try and hope to see you in the game thegrid

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun

ok ive decided to come back and rereview this game with all the updates and small changes its alot better and it doesnt feel as boring and samey the particle effects can chug the frame rate but other then that the graphics are still top notch the weapons are kinda bullet hosey but with what ive been using its still nice and responsive the melee attacks feel better some how the have more impact then nothing playing with others is definatly were this game shines but keep in mind your revives the whole self revive is a bit annoying when you run out as you need to pay so thats a tad stingy overall the business model is somewhat fair you get credits faster and level up faster so it doesnt feel like a grind i now do recommend the game as it is much better and deserves extensive play even if not in one sitting however the business model isnt perfect and can feel aggresive so be warned

one of the best f2p games i have played and most likely the best tps out there most games may be slow in the start and catch up as you go along but warframe manages to pace it pretty evenly altough closer to high level gameplays if you are playing by yourself wich i unfirtunatly am things will start to get slow very fast however if you manage to get into a clan or make one yourself and have people play with you it will quickly start to catch up again i recomend finding friends to play with and go on missions like the void and the like and since the creators are nearly always working on the game you can expect updates very often and check out their twitch to get the latest news 8510

mate what a gem of a game for free this is well worth it its not a  piece of freemium software either this is a properly f2p game so heres the breakdown criteria score graphics 9 gameplay 8 contenttd] 10 [tr][table] graphics in this game are pretty stunning but there are occasional texturing issues and glitches gameplay is repetative but addictive and most of all great fun shooting an enemy then jumping on his buddy and cutting him in half honestly gives you a bloodlusty rush the amount of content in this game is fantastic many weapons warframes and abilities all make up this wide selection each warframe weapon and ability are all vastly different and provide a great selection to play by your style overall 910 congratulations to the developers youve provided an proper free to play game without it being pay to win as so many games are these days well done

hey it was good

i do recommend this but there is a bug taht bans u for no reason but it happens rarely so dw this game is totally awesoem and the addition of the kubrow makes it much more fun

hell yes

this unique f2p game is one of the best pc games out there it has a very nice system of parkour combat and other things and the updates come out at a rather frequent rate always giving you more and looking forward to more the one thing that i dont like is the secondary currency of platinum which can only be bought through realworld money but you can get up to 50% off discounts just by playing the game and it is not at all paytowin you can progress easily through the game if you really want to platinum just makes it to where you can get a jump across some obstacles everything is can be accesed and nothing seems to be platinum exclusive 9510 stars i really recommend this game

it is a really fun game if your into advanced games like alienfuture type games and mmos so if you play it you cant stop till atleast you have two max lvl warframes d

a game about space ninjas please ignore
recommended
this game is truly an amazing space age kinda game i love it for its customization and gameplay techniques c
recommended
its a fun and fast paced game that successfully makes you feel like a badass you are essentially a space ninja that carries out objectives on different planets levelling up and taking on more difficult enemiesyou can leap over railings slide through doorways all whilst firing at an enemy you can then finish him off by slicing him in half with your sword and watch his body split in two it makes you feel very powerful and very agile the game is great for free to play and most fun is had when you work with friends it can become a problem later on if you do play with randoms as you may need to collect loot whereas they may want to race to the finish you then miss out on the bonus creds for finishing the level loot is necessary to build new weapons warframes and sentinels when you have acquired the necessary blueprint this is where the game becomes a little grindy you sometimes have to repeat the same boss and same planets over and over in order to get the materials or blueprints that you want update blueprints have been made easier to collect you can however purchase them with real money in the shop and some items such as new skin colours can only be purchased this way the levels are very samey and the map is randomly generated you can sometimes run through an identical room two or three times in one level and that doesnt include the required backtrackingthere is also a limited number of planets at this time and you can only level each warframe up to 30 which doesnt take very long to do perhaps this will be addressed at a later point as the game doesnt provide much incentive to keep you playing the game doesnt scale down if you want to play solo so it can be a refreshing change of pace and is great for someone that wants a serious challenge warframe can be very fun and id certainly recommend it to anybody who wants to hack through large waves of enemies and feel awesome doing it it does become quite repetitive but it is definitely worth a go since its free to play
recommended
one of the few computer games that i play easy to navigate and enought action to keep me going
recommended
ive only played this game for a little while but its an amazing game at first it was a bit confusing but after a few missions everything makes sense the actual boss fights requires you to use some strategy but thats a good thing because its not just a shoot and kill sort of game but as with 99% of f2p games it does have some bugs sometimes if you slide thrugh a wall you might glitch through it another thing it lacks is after a while you sorta get used to fighting the regular enemies the pros are that the gameplay is solid its fun to murder foes with friends there are many weapons to chose from & the warframes are also a pretty nice thing overall i give it a 910
recommended
warframe is a bit of an enigma in the free to play market as it is very different from most other free to play games so instead of rating it the way i usually do im going to list the pros and cons and you can decide for yourself pros very polished gameplay and mechanics a large variety of frames and weapons leading to many styles of gameplay with new ones being added on a roughly monthly basis very indepth customization ive yet to see 2 frames with the exact same color scheme built in alertinvasion system for bonus rewards so the game doesnt get boring built in high difficulty setting for missions youve already cleared so lower level missions are still worth coming back to seasonal events that shake things up a bit constant stream of rewards from doing missions generally nice community cons some frames are really hard to get if you dont pay eg components are bound to random alerts etc there are a few balancing issues making some frames and weapons far superior to others limited warframe slots if you dont buy more 2 by default game hits a slight difficulty wall around jupiter missions and beyond if you dont have an orokin reactor starting weapons are terrible get others as soon as you can some items seem a little highly priced for you get ex $5 for a new color palette environments can get a little repeatative after a while other notes things that could be a pro or con depending on your preferance and are worth mentioning pvp almost nonexistant 90% of the game is pve generally not advised to play solo and will get the most fun out of it with friends has trading system but is very limited damage system is fairly complex and deep may be confusing to some a little grindy to get some items but if you have a fair amount of patience shouldnt be too bad no dedicated servers game just picks the best host and starts and thats the gist of warframe if youre on the fence give it a try its free to play

still the best game out there

gameplay 710 story 510 based on lore online 710 very p2w pay to win you can buy everything and they even have donor deals that give you more elite items for giving over $100 never the less this game is fun to play with friends or online just make sure you have a decent internet connection since it is still beta there a few glitcheslike flinging yourself across the map but they are more wtf was that and dont destroy the gameplay most of the weapons you want are also craftable for mostly resonable resources and in game cost so p2w slightly balances out for weapons the different warframes and difficult to get so either be prepaired to fork over some cash to get the one you want or grind for the resources you need to make it the warframe you start out with is prefectly viable and works so they arent forcing you to p2w online is decent people a generally very nice though not often helpful whether though lack of knowledge or lack of input except lag issues though especially with lots of other people i only recommend this because it is free and you dont have to pay to have decent items to play with
recommended
beautiful game that should set itself as an example of whats to come into the future of firstperson shooter mmorpgs warframe blends superb graphics great controls a startling concept with an interesting backstory and hella rad gameplay to provide a good timesink and good game for all try it and you will not regret a single thing also did i mention its a freetoplay with minimal forcefulness in microtransactions

warframe is awesome but you will need to spend a lot of time grinding solar systems to get good gear its well worth the grind in the end if your looking for a game thats got grity and hard fought battles that require a good team with some good ability to fill in the trinity somewhat warframe is your game 1010 in my book for a 3rd person shooter with the capablity of soloing most of it
recommended
warframe is mass effects gameplay combined with halos versatility meshed together with left 4 dead 2s cooperative teamwork this game is the epitamy of f2p games in my opinion with a very good model anything that you can buy with real money can be acquired in game for free and the best equipment cannot be bought at all this game is easily my favorite one to play and i highly recommend you try it out

this is a awesome game

so far its the best mmofps i have ever seen the graphics are great and there are several characters to choose from but at first you can only pick from the 3 that they give you so far the updates keep getting better and better there are some items that can be bought with special currency but there are also items that can be obtain just by earning money from the missions if you wanted to do some missions on your own you can play the game in solo mode some mission can be challenging but they can be done at the moment there isnt a signal thing that is negative about the game
recommended
the games graphics and style are awesome and 3rd personshooter action s pretty solid though the melee could be better the game has a crafting mechanic for the weapons which is cool as it adds replayablity however i found it very grindy and i play games like disgaea and monster hunter so when i say this game is grindyit really is grindy some people may infact love that but personally it was too much for me overall its a good game and is worth playing at least once since its free to play give it a go

this game is incredibly buggy but not so bad that it makes you want to stop playing theres a lot that they can fix but its still a new game all in all highly addicting game that you do not have to pay to play if anyone else wants to play my username is of course reikadeniah

its a great game that has fun fast paced shotter action the missions are fun  although not diverce and the weapon and charextor levelinbg is relatively ok the big fall offs from this game for me is the lack of a real story and the lack of super late game content overall an amazing game that is free to play and well worth picking up 8510

i totally approve of this game bit glitchy from time to time but what did anyone expect from an open beta game i tried it once got hooked and so did a friend of mine who didnt like it at first theres potential and players seems to be part of how this game evolves 3 major letdowns though first out are those russians and whatnot who keep insisting not to use english when doing online gameplay even when they are asked to keep it so everyone could understand second speedrunning kids who go from start to end asap without actually doing any real gameplay third is more of a personal preference as even if they support the devs i find it extremly lazy when people just buy their gear with platinum as it just takes out the fun of the game everyone want it all but no one seems to be willing to work and wait for it shame but other than that its a fun game and even more with friends so bring them nazher
recommended
this game is badass
recommended
this games great i still enjoy it but its a gindfest game
recommended
one of the best graphics of any thirdperson shooter game this is a titant amount dwarfs the story is engaging and the combat systems are fun i laugh at the ai sometimes they sometimes run in circles but this is truely a game with potential and i cant wait to see wht they come up with next
recommended
the best sciencefiction thirdperson shooter game ever
recommended
im using up all my time on this game its realy good
recommended
plays alot like the multiplayer in mass effect 3 but this game this game is so much more the rpg element is perfect for anyone simple for people who want action but it has so many layers of complexity to reward you if you choose to experiment perfect with either friends or strangers the missions are built to encurage comradship between players if your a brawler you like the rhino suit and the awsome cowbell abillities if you like to play smart then your only limit is your imagination and if you love guns you can build em buy em mod em and test them as you travel the solar system the missions come in many veriaties assassinate targets in insane boss fights wipe out entire enemy garrisons either with unstoppable force or with cunning usage of the games stealth system defend the center of your base until extraction or stay for ever greater rewards and if you dont like the sound of those there are many more to choose from 95 out of 10 because its still getting better
recommended
its fun no pay to win because its coop
recommended
great game really like it please make it for mac though so i can play with my friends you could make alot more money
recommended
keeps you on your toes lots of fun and extremely addicting such a good game
recommended
space ninjas think of this diablo  fps thats pretty much what this is maybe not something you play for years but its definatly worth a few hours why are you still reading dl and play it now
recommended
nice game free running could be little better and coordinated but still its very good game to have fun for free
recommended
wow where to begin with warframe this is a great game none the less but its pay to win can ruin its feel if they made it so you can buy materials with credits or even blueprints for materials this game would be so much better but other than that great game good graphics 810
recommended
dis gam hav spes ninjas and sheeot

this game is amazingly addicting it has space ninjas and guns a combo that has blended quite well the game does require time to be put in in order to reap the benefits if youre going to play this casually make sure youre playing with friends this game is almost entirely free to play with premium currency there mostly as a way to cut back on grinding and construction times if theres one flaw to this game its the grinding if you want resources or blueprints youll have to put in some work but in the end it feels very satisfying using a weapon you worked hard to acquire overall this game gets a massive 1110 of my ratings loved every minute of it that ive played
recommended
awesome game nothing else
recommended
one of the best free games you`ll play
recommended
what a game simple coop but intriguing playandcraft style
recommended
freetoplay amazing unique graphics option to paybut you can gather materials and blueprints and craft everything that you could pay for with exception to some asthetic items it is absolutely not paytowin atleast check it out
recommended
well it is certainly a fun game it focuses on loose teams of upto four players working together to accomplish a variety of goals the assortment of weapons and armors is impressive and still growing and the ability to customize the arributes of your armors and weapons just make it reign supreme when it comes to being allowed to do things your way you can play it like an assualt shooting game or as a sneaky ninja game theres even a solo mode for when you just want to have some fun all by yourself quietly so if you enjoy coop fps shooting stabbing cyber ninja games this one is probably for you go get them tenno
recommended
awesome free game and its great to play with your friends
recommended
well worth the price
recommended
not a bad third person shooter considering its free its quite good takes a long time to get things ie you have to get matierals and then wait real time for them to buildany where between 1 hour and 24 hours none the less it has alot of content and is fairly good 710
recommended
awesome game one of the best on pc but keeps freezing up on me and makes me restart my comp and lose progress
recommended
this a game with amazing graghics and game play
recommended
cant get enough of this game the constant updates keeps this game interesting and enjoyable while it will take awhile to become a relatively good player and feel like youre doing enough damage the investment of your time will pay off also unless you are going to constantly sink money into this game it will take some time to get better weapons and frames because you construct in real time and game resources are usurped quite a bit the community is friendly and helpful and the ingame trade is very nice as you can trade real money ingame items and ingame currency allinall a great game that i would recommend to anyone and everyone and the best part isits free
recommended
best free game ive ever played
recommended
great way to pass the time and can be hard at times to level but keep you intrested
recommended
good gamefast pacedaction packed worth checking out
recommended
do you like sentai power rangers karate bugmen then this is the grindfest for you only complaint is not enough karate
recommended
so far its the best mmofps i have ever seen the graphics are great and there are several characters to choose from but at first you can only pick from the 3 that they give you so far the updates keep getting better and better there are some items that can be bought with special currency but there are also items that can be obtain just by earning money from the missions if you wanted to do some missions on your own you can play the game in solo mode some mission can be challenging but they can be done at the moment there isnt a signal thing that is negative about the game

really great game for those who like overtheshoulder 3rd person shooters the gameplay is just great really fast can lag a bit smooth movement parkour challenging enemies great competetive multiplayer lots of enemy drops & just overall great gameplaythe character custimization is incredible over 15 characters that you can custimize with accessories give mods to which increase characters stats & give them abilities you can even custimize the weapons the characters & weapons lvl up outside the game letting you give them more mods the only downside i found was most items characters and equipment cost the ingame money you have to pay for platinum

warframe is a very interresting and constantly evolving shooter game a combination of driving storyline highly mobile combat and compelling graphic makes it one of the best free to play game out there the game as a large store for real money transaction but there is nothing in there that cannot be gained by hard work and playing not a game for solo player it really reward you for joining a clan and pairing up with your friends the game`s difficulty seriously ramp up otherwise also beware the stalker
recommended
warframe is a very fun game that gets updated regularly and is also very fun to play with friends because it has a strageystealth aspect that can be used my only complaint about the game is the farming for crafting its very tedious and includes you getting the blueprint for the item getting the crafting components for the blueprint usually involving farming then waiting for the item to finish after you use credits and the components other than that warframe is very unique to any other game in the genre and definitly deserves some attention for how cool it is
recommended
warframe is litterly an all around amazing game the gameplay is very good the weapon selection and combination possobilitys are funominal

warframe is beautiful in terms of diversity and content you can play any type of build you can dream and it doesnt stop being fun even when youve been off for a while

others reviews will tell all the good points of this game what my reviews going to tell you is how fluid the progression is after hundreds of play i still have a clear goal and i can just loggin for about an hour and progress toward my goals first of all lets set how you get better at this game  _______________________________ short version  you get better by doing one of those farming xp defense survival requires good gear the real challenge farming credits you go in a void mission in a team easy if youre faster its better farming mods nightmarehard missions you either need a good friend luck or skills  vault missionmediumhard missions you need a team farming prime gear  requires void mission may be rare for some pieces but some other pieces are easy gettign new frames reaaal easy just kill the planets boss getting platinium without money  you either get good mods or prime gear and tradi it with people expect 1 potato  2h boost a weapon to its maximum  forma it 3 times which reset its level to 0 so about 8 hours to get that weapon from 0 to 30 4 times you better really like this weapon  so you see in youer 1st month get all the frames and some better gear in second month spend credits on mods and acquire beter mods in other months get a frame to be reall good forma and taste the poweeeerrr later get every frame to lvl 30 with a potato because every frame is awesome and allows you to play a completely different style  _____________ long version  you get xp on your gear weapon frame this xp doesnt increase directly its stats but instead allow you to put mods in the said equipement the max level of a piece is 30 if you go on an appropriate map you can get a piece from 0 to 30 in about 23 hours requires a good team if youre starting maybe 510 hours in you could have a lvl 30 on top of those 30 points for mods you can insert an orokin reactor to double those points these are buyable for 20 platinum with 1$ you can have about 5 orokin reactors aka potatoes i dont know for you but paying 5$ for my first 12 months of playing is quite acceptable ^^ aaaand if you really dont want to pay a dollar you can theres a trade system in the game allowing you to sell good parts for platinum to give you an idea 2 good mods which you can get from 510 hours in the game or less if youre rushing for it will give you about 1 potato after that how to get better frame  weapons you can clear all the planatary systems to get the basic warframes which some are insanely good just kill the boss of every planet about 5 times and youll have all the frammeeees d youll get youre 1st frame about 10h in the game then the crafting will take 3 days and a half you gotta take a day off  then personnaly ive got my 3th to 6th frame in the same day which then means after 2 weeks in the game you can have access to half the frames d but then youce got all that gear but none is really powerfull how comes you have to level up yor mods too some will be easy to level up but some costs up to a million credits so if youre tired of farming gear go get some more credits the void missons are perfect for that and you want a bonus on top of fast credits ok the void gives you some special gear too then you got your weapon lvl 30 with a potato and with good mods in it can you get it better yes theres a system called forma it gets your gear to lvl 0 but changes 1 mod slot to make it cost 50% less points

i like the game however i only wish it was an actual retail game where i pay 20$ and get a physical copy with a good amount of stuff in it instead of a free 2 play game

warframe is a fast paced third person game set in our solar system in what seems to be the distant future you play as a tenno from what i can see are a group of highly advanced space ninjas set to eliminate hostile species in the solar system while its a fun game the levels just keep repeating like angry birds go the levels are just destroy the core or find the hostage or take out that guy each gamemode has a different map but that map keeps repeating each planet has a different mas though now the maps repeat over and over again but this game just keeps getting so addicting with a wide variety of weapons which of course youll need to pay for them make this game like tf2 with the weapon system except you dont really get weapons randomly like tf2 warframe is a f2p that is only available on pc but now there is a version the the ps4 which isnt a f2p and i believe costs 60 bucks id say just buy the game but youll also need to create an account be wise when choosing your tenno as each one is different for new people i suggest getting the balaned excalibur class every class has a melee weapon which you can buy different melee weapons you start off with a sick katana which you can slice enemies with or if you wanna go complete mafia mode you can get the electric knuckles if you want my rating i rate this 710 install this
recommended
great coop game unlike anyother no extra fees it is awsome some glitches but good support team 9510

this is a amazing game very fun more so if you have friends to play with

fourplayer cooperative space ninja thirdpersonshooter of surprisingly high quality for a freetoplay title but with unsurprisingly pricy boosters gameplay has been changing over the course of development but theres a multitude of weapons to play with sound gets better de is putting their love into development despite what we say about them and actively engages the community sure its a smoothly fit together amalgation of many existing ideas in a way but warframe is still one of the better freetoplay shooters around
recommended
warframe a game with ninjas in space fighting robots wierd evolved humans or something and aliens also you are doing it all without effort in that full body suit that covers your eyes so i have no idea how you see but still it is a great game and i give ot 510 for its bugs and glitches and weeks of trying to fix it
recommended
one the best 3rd person shooters ive played in along time space ninjas with guns what more do you want the game is still in beta yes but its extremely playable and enjoyable for a f2p game you really dont need to induluge in mircotransaction to compete which makes for a pleasent change overall 810 the game has pleanty of potential left in it for that to change to a 9

great blend of action rpg elements

unrelentingly hard and crafting wait time simulator 1010 game of the year

i tried to play this game when it first came out but it was a bit to weird for me but ive gotten back into it in the past few days once i figured out how to do everything and got my keys all set up i love it the movement in the game is amazing the ablility to run up along walls and climb on and jump on pretty much everything in the environment is awesome i find the game menu a bit confusing with all the planets but its not to bad the customization is pretty cool i havent found much to buy with in game money yet but im sure what will come most of the stuff seems to have a real money cost i like the idea behind it its pretty original so if you are looking for something new that combines a lot of different types of combat check it out

a great game for players who are bored and seek action and a few challenges

a game about space ninjas please ignore
recommended
this game is truly an amazing space age kinda game i love it for its customization and gameplay techniques c
recommended
its a fun and fast paced game that successfully makes you feel like a badass you are essentially a space ninja that carries out objectives on different planets levelling up and taking on more difficult enemiesyou can leap over railings slide through doorways all whilst firing at an enemy you can then finish him off by slicing him in half with your sword and watch his body split in two it makes you feel very powerful and very agile the game is great for free to play and most fun is had when you work with friends it can become a problem later on if you do play with randoms as you may need to collect loot whereas they may want to race to the finish you then miss out on the bonus creds for finishing the level loot is necessary to build new weapons warframes and sentinels when you have acquired the necessary blueprint this is where the game becomes a little grindy you sometimes have to repeat the same boss and same planets over and over in order to get the materials or blueprints that you want update blueprints have been made easier to collect you can however purchase them with real money in the shop and some items such as new skin colours can only be purchased this way the levels are very samey and the map is randomly generated you can sometimes run through an identical room two or three times in one level and that doesnt include the required backtrackingthere is also a limited number of planets at this time and you can only level each warframe up to 30 which doesnt take very long to do perhaps this will be addressed at a later point as the game doesnt provide much incentive to keep you playing the game doesnt scale down if you want to play solo so it can be a refreshing change of pace and is great for someone that wants a serious challenge warframe can be very fun and id certainly recommend it to anybody who wants to hack through large waves of enemies and feel awesome doing it it does become quite repetitive but it is definitely worth a go since its free to play
recommended
one of the few computer games that i play easy to navigate and enought action to keep me going
recommended
ive only played this game for a little while but its an amazing game at first it was a bit confusing but after a few missions everything makes sense the actual boss fights requires you to use some strategy but thats a good thing because its not just a shoot and kill sort of game but as with 99% of f2p games it does have some bugs sometimes if you slide thrugh a wall you might glitch through it another thing it lacks is after a while you sorta get used to fighting the regular enemies the pros are that the gameplay is solid its fun to murder foes with friends there are many weapons to chose from & the warframes are also a pretty nice thing overall i give it a 910

warframe is a bit of an enigma in the free to play market as it is very different from most other free to play games so instead of rating it the way i usually do im going to list the pros and cons and you can decide for yourself pros very polished gameplay and mechanics a large variety of frames and weapons leading to many styles of gameplay with new ones being added on a roughly monthly basis very indepth customization ive yet to see 2 frames with the exact same color scheme built in alertinvasion system for bonus rewards so the game doesnt get boring built in high difficulty setting for missions youve already cleared so lower level missions are still worth coming back to seasonal events that shake things up a bit constant stream of rewards from doing missions generally nice community cons some frames are really hard to get if you dont pay eg components are bound to random alerts etc there are a few balancing issues making some frames and weapons far superior to others limited warframe slots if you dont buy more 2 by default game hits a slight difficulty wall around jupiter missions and beyond if you dont have an orokin reactor starting weapons are terrible get others as soon as you can some items seem a little highly priced for you get ex $5 for a new color palette environments can get a little repeatative after a while other notes things that could be a pro or con depending on your preferance and are worth mentioning pvp almost nonexistant 90% of the game is pve generally not advised to play solo and will get the most fun out of it with friends has trading system but is very limited damage system is fairly complex and deep may be confusing to some a little grindy to get some items but if you have a fair amount of patience shouldnt be too bad no dedicated servers game just picks the best host and starts and thats the gist of warframe if youre on the fence give it a try its free to play

do you have too much money too much time tired of buying expensive timepieces to rid yourself of money only to be reminded by said timepieces of how much time youre wasting sick of games that become more detailed when you crank the graphics to the max do you feel the urge to immerse yourself in a complex toneuncertain story do you enjoy the idea of rubbery fleshy looking armor is grinding for weapon components dropped by blatantly rigged rng systems your idea of a good time on an unrelated note warframe is megapublisher extreme digitals latest foray into the realm of microtransaction ponzi schemes this spiritual successor to fatal frame is packed to the brim with unbalanced unique player classes more than four distinct mindlessenemy types and enough postprocessing effects to make a blind man see and quickly become blind again with the new addition of fully 3drendered ingame transmissions warframes dark gritty and sometimes neither story unfolds before your very eyes your very strained eyes meanwhile behind your very eyes money slithers out of your wallet and makes a mad dash toward the developers do you have too much money too much time and so on and so forth if you said yes to any of those questions warframe may be right for you youll be saying no in no time final score 3 out of 9 planets warframe receives the prestigious distinction of mega money mangler well on its way to game of the year if nothing else gets released for a year

this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat  up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun
recommended
nine out of tenno

great game can be played solo but is most injoyable wih 4 people does get a little repetative and getting new stuff ccn be a chore but its still one of the best free to play games out there and you should totally get it

two words space ninjas pretty good f2p third person shooter with parkour and group play elements can be a little grindy and repetitive after a while if they dont put out new content other wise its one of the better f2p games you can download
recommended
space ninjas fighting space zombies space russians and space merchants in space

warframe is a very fun in my opinion game it has tons of content and almost everything can be gotten without paying for platinum my only problem is that my computer is having problems updating it
recommended
fun coop game so far alot of upgradingcrafting aswell if youre into that if you enjoy l4d2 and mass effect you will prolly enjoy it i really enjoy the graphics in this game aswell its free hello

really laggy and slow motion is blurry and super fast its a great concept go just have to iron out bugs and movement as well as aiming

flying space ninjas in space it is so fun but i found it to be to heavey on the grind at some stages but overall youll have fun from the amount of parkor and slide melee fliping ninkas

play warframe its so great best third person shooter ever
recommended
awesome gameplay upgrades graphics etc this game is highly addictive thanks to the developers for an awesome experience 
recommended
i recommend the game have you tried the gwgears of war series this is the closest thing as it gets the only thing i dont like is the repetition of maps in different levels
recommended
meh jk you guys should really try it 
recommended
warframe is a great game just because it has a lot of platinum stuff in the shop doesnt mean you have to spend moneyplatinum being the special currency bought with real money you can use credits to buy blueprints and craft the items no need to spend money it makes the game a lot better when you have to work for all your new guns etc
recommended
fun if you have a friend otherwise it gets dull pretty qukcly
recommended
great shooter and competitive game great with friends and still offers a good single player experience very fast paced not recommended for those with slower computers
recommended
this game is the pinacle of online co op while most developers are copying the first person shooter warfame broght back the 3rd person shooter you are a powered and skilled person in a suit but it has a realistic sort of element to it i cant really put my words on it but you need your team mated in this game and thats what makes it fun that you have to work together protect and heal each other its not just about pressing click and aiming carelessly great things like good xping story bosses and upgrades keep this game refreshing the visuals also are great for a free to play game they update fix and patch the game consistently as for any online game it does have bumps here and their but getting into a game is fast unline most definately download this game i usually dont buy items online but i bought one to show my little support of how i like these people who keep adding and fixing the game

one the best 3rd person shooters ive played in along time space ninjas with guns what more do you want the game is still in beta yes but its extremely playable and enjoyable for a f2p game you really dont need to induluge in mircotransaction to compete which makes for a pleasent change overall 810 the game has pleanty of potential left in it for that to change to a 9
recommended
great blend of action rpg elements
recommended
unrelentingly hard and crafting wait time simulator 1010 game of the year
recommended
so much fun even better with friends tho
recommended
i find this game to be somewhat of an oxymoron it is centered around the thematic ninja but is constantly devolving into chaotic button mashing and a screen full of bloom and particles the game is given to us in the form of a crack ateam of spaceninjas but very rarely does one feel like an assassin the warframes are cool and the art design for them is amazing but some of these abilities are completely hit or miss and especially in the late game practically unusable enemy hit points are simply too large for some of the games spellslinging frames to be practical ability economy is at a low but at least you can remove them from your frame the game does do one thing right and that is the progression of equipment and building of new frames is very satisfactory i cant tell you how desperate i was to complete my frost and after you start crafting your preferred frames you start to enjoy the game much more but maybe thats because i didnt care much for excalibur one of the biggest faults of the game is the annoying maps and the enemies pathing ai that dont want to work with each other forcing the defense mission in question to be unwinnable just something that needs ironing out melee combat and movement combos are tones of fun if not a little sensitive
recommended
wareframe is a damn good time get three friends and play till your hearts content i liked this game so much ive spent money on warframes and weapons in the real money market and i dont regret it if anything its only made the game that much more fun if you dont have the money to spend you can unlock almost anything just by playing enough lots of cool feautres and a solid build
recommended
if youre looking for a time sink youve come to the right place a rather interesting game in the already hypersaturated freetoplay shooter genre i personally enjoy the various mechanics and the iterative fundamental gameplay changes the developers continue to roll out every few weeks just be aware that if you like this game expect to spend massive amounts of time grinding through semirepetitive situations it is actually completely possible to progress in this game with the freetoplay model as the games scalingprogressive content is influenced by the number of missions that you do and you can get ingame money for upgrades by trading valuable blueprintsmods to other players though the game seems to push that this is all about space ninjas i think its better to describe this game as a thirdperson mobile shooting gallery as enemy ai is very basic and your ranged weapons have the most effective damage throughout all stages of the game the most recent update u13 introduced melee 20 which greatly boosted the effectiveness of melee weaponry though that being said only a small handful of weapons are effective at all in the late game would i recommend this to my friends no too much time of mine has been wasted shooting and cutting millions of enemies to ribbons i do not exactly regret that time but i worry that anyone else who plays it may find their time consumed very quickly would i recommend this to anyone else absolutely its a grindfest with enjoyable replayability and a broad spectrum of content to satisfy your tastes i find the game relaxing most of the time that being said the game really isnt intended to be that way and from what i gather new players have a very difficult time getting used to various mechanics enemy types and advancing in the game best way to start find a friend whos experienced have them carry you through a few missions to help you get some advanced materials playing the game with friends is quite a lot more enjoyable than with pubs i look forward to the future of this game and i sincerely enjoy participating in its continual evolution

although its a huge grindfest warframe is fast slick and looks damn good effortlessly switching between gun and sword to eliminate a horde of enemies while bounding off a wall is nothing short of gratifying

i really love the game and the diversity you can experience although i do believe they should lower the time to make things warframes take 3 days to make by themselves not to mention the 12 hours for each part other than the building times this game is very fun and i hope it can bring alot more warframes into the mix even though it already has so many
recommended
frankly the longer i pay this game the more i cannot believe it is free now believe me i hate to say that because of the risk of it becoming something other than free but this game has some serious high points first off the game is beautifully rendered the combat is very smooth and easy to pick up even if you are just beginning as you progress you become more and more aware of the acrobatic aspect of the game this coupled with the different combat options makes for a truly interesting experience
recommended
best online coop ive ever played
recommended
slow at first but when you get into it its a whole new experience

kinda fun to play with friends or not but it takes way too long to get any good items if you dont want to pay any money like me

best game ever created
recommended
two main things i like about this game first of all those things in the trailers i saw precisely one thing you cant actually do in game it was when loki stabbed two enemies at once and if the devs follow through with their promises that might be possible by the next major update second since the trading systems implementation there is literally nothing in the game that you cant get as a f2p player which i am paying helps but hard work will get you farther than any amount of cash in terms of originality it seems like the developers had never played another video game in their lives its often hard to find games that arent influenced by star wars halo or other successful franchises these days but this is one of those few overall great game and i wish more games were like this
recommended
great quality both in the graphics and gameplay department great variety of play styles a bit grindy but an overall great experience recommended
recommended
parkour and combat in a distant future figthing stinkin humans and weirdo robots with the moderate variety of weapon selection nothing can get in your way you are the tenno well your granmama can stop you for dinner you fall in disgust noticing your granmamas terrible cooking and her soup reeks of stink next time get your own crib

its a good game but i cant stop lagging but it is extremly well textured and well developed so that makes up for it

a great game but later on it turns into pay to win good job making a game developers crappy job making it legitley free
recommended
the game has really nice graphics a very interesting story line a beautifull interface and a lot of action 1010
recommended
amazing game there are optional microtransactions but if you have patience you can avoid them easily amazing gameplay you can still even notice the developers are into it every month or less theres a new update adding more to do with the daily activities you get rewards and the missions are diffirent everytime you do them i can grind for hours and it doesnt feel like grinding unlike many other games
recommended
a recommended
recommended
its a fun and beautiful game but the only problems are its ftp which means micro transactions said purchaseable items are needed for the more difficult levels as free items are weak or take forever to acquire you need to level every new weapon you acquire there will be areas or missions where you will need a full team play when you have nothing else to play or do
recommended
really fun game you could play it for days without geting board practly endless replay ability good bosses crafting system dojos and drop system

itll take a day or two to fully grasp this game and its seemingly complex play and mechanics however once you do its well worth every minute of time you sink into it with varied weapons highly unique warframes a friendly very helpful community and dedicated devs willing to continuously add content and fix bugsglitches if you have the time its simply a nobrainer to download and keep playing this

this game is awesome great graphics awesome combat and endless fun although the turorial is lacking i would recomend chacking out the wiki on start up info i would definetly recomend this and have to friends

this game is really fun to play with you friends there is a stealth aspect to the game which i love and youre able to go in guns blazing aswel
recommended
its a radical game about space ninjas goin round killin stuff its not p2w everybody has the same resources available paying or not so dont let others talk you into that though the game is a bit of a grind at times search x for insert resource andor blueprint here and build up the credits to create what you want rng is a total hack but dont let that water down your fun overall its a nice game to play with friends or by yourself money will make the game easier though you dont have to at all
recommended
quite possibly one the greatest freetoplay games on the market the community is decent the graphics are dazzling and the combat is explosive however this game loses its appeal once the equipment and character acquisition grind come into play all characters and weapons are craftable however paytowin is a very viable option unfortunately with crafting times varying from 1 day to 3 days for each piece let alone the actual multiple piece item the environments are recycled and lose their shine after a while though it really doesnt detract from the game seeing as how it fits the clonepiratezombie storyline overall a superb game until you hit the equipment wall
recommended
what more can you say but  must download  must play best f2p 3
recommended
amazing game but be prapared for lag if your on a lower end system
recommended
warframe was a different game for me i usually dont play online third person shooters or any online shooter for that matter the game had a interesting setup i liked the fact that this game has a lot of customization on weapons however the game has quite a few issues first of all this game is heavy pay to win crafting in this game takes a lot of time 12 hours for weapons and a lot of credits in game currency however people who pay for the game can just buy these weapons from the start people who pay can also buy additional warframes from the start which have to be crafted it is very difficult to do by non paying members non paying members are also limited in even the basic colors of their warframe they are only given a tiny fraction of colors that didnt include black which bothered me since its one of my favorite colors that are honestly not that good with the exception of a few as for gameplay itself it seemed to have good mechanics i liked the fact that you can beat a level with stealth to avoid fighting masses of enemies best done solo with loki warframe weapon balance seemed good combat is fast paced fluid and full of action live action and several different ways to use melee attacks along with awesome jumps had me at times just messing around with the controls for fun the game feels kind of disconnected between players though throughout my time playing this game very few players would talk to me and honestly there wasnt much to talk about the game also has very repetetive maps while i understand making a unique map for every single level would be impossible throughout my time playing i only saw three maps an underground cave a base on a icy planet and a warship the individual sections are also repetitive by one or two playthroughs of each map you will have seen almost every section there is it would be nice to see a unique design for every world which i think is possible the missions themselves are highly repetative i found myself doing the same thing over and over again with few alterations some new mission types should be added to the game to curb its repetetive feel in the end if you are going to play this game as a dedicated player be ready to fork out some money because my f2p run of this game had me leaving by the time i finished mars some improvments that i think would help the game create at least three unique maps for each world get a world chat lobby to connect the players a little more make demos for weapons so we know what the gun is like before we go through the trouble of getting them and add some new missions to make the game less repetetive well there is my review

warframe is amazing it keeps you coming back as almost every new update brings new things to the game this game is up to par and quite possibly better than all of the other f2p games ive played to date i stongly encourage anyone reading this to at least try this game out
recommended
not bad at all actually
recommended
mass effect much
recommended
not that bad has few issues
recommended
a fun hack and slash  third person shooter try it
recommended
its a fun game to play but unfortunately with out putting a bit of money into it it can get boring and repetitive fast
recommended
as free to play games go this game has given me hours of enjoyment i do think that this is one of my favorit games and i would deffently recommend it to anyone wanting to play a good game
recommended
a smart and intuitive free to play shooter that gives numerous possibilities of gameplay its simple and fun to play highly recommended for people who like shooters with huge wars in it
recommended
wont load and keeps crashing i would get it though since its free and alot of people play it thats just my problem
recommended

do not payattention to the metacritc sorce becuase this game is one of the best free to play games of all time to make things easier when you first start to game the games goes unto its oone seperate luancher which downloads all of the updates some people find that the updating process is annoying but after that this game gets very fun also you should know that this game does not operate on pay to play you can build wepons and new warframes you dont have to buy them i repeat you dont have buy new wepons and warframes take your time be patent and dont buy new stuff and you will love this game if you have a question just look up a guide on steam or google thanks
recommended
its a good and enjoyable game if u really understand it its got varietes of classes adding to the joy
recommended
this game in my opinion is one of the top 5 best free games on steam although warframe thrives off of microtransactions everything can still be done 100% free
recommended
the most addicting free to play mmo in which ive spent the most money more than years of subscriptions to pay to play mmos to me this game has that addictive magic find run experience you keep trying to find the best mods for your weapons and warframes crafting is simple getting the parts takes time but it can be done relatively easily this game is a must play i have not resubscribed to ffxiv because of this game
recommended
warframe is a higly coorperative thirdperson shooting game so youd need some friends to be playing this game before you pick this up to me this game is really fun  parkouring and killing aliens with your spectacular looking skills but this game is sadly quite repititive and id love to see the developers make somemore maps and items for us players to enjoy
recommended
one of the best ftps ive encountered stunning graphics smooth controls and amazing levels of customization its like ninja gaiden mashed with a dystopian future a

with most free to play games there are two catigores 1 the free to play no catch but the graphics are going to be s or 2 free to playbut if you want to get anywhere in the leaderboards or storyline you have to fork over some cash warframe breaks this steriotype the graphics are amazing the gameplay has a few gliches but they are adressed soon after they are found the gameplay is almost seamless and most importantly the game is completely free to play the game creaters are able to make money in the same way credic card companies do you can wait anywhere from half a day week for that new gun or you can give us $5 and we will upgrade it and get it to you instantly in this manor players that are non paying members have just as much freedom as pay to play members i find myself playing this game more then the games i actually paid to own overall 5 stars
recommended
i had a lot of fun playing this game with friends
recommended
very addicting
recommended
its free and fun
recommended
an enjoyable f2p game graphics are pretty good i had trouble getting it to work initially on my system required quite a bit of tweaking and googling to get it to run correctly the biggest problem i had was intense random lag on certain hosts i mostly played with a friend of mine 300 miles away and the lag i experienced made the game near unplayable we both have midtohigh level internet service and have no problems in other games other hosts i joined 4000 miles away were fine ymmv
recommended
i dunno this will help or not but when i play warframe its just enjoyable with the graphic setting and the gameplay itself
recommended
a solid game fluid gameplay and good action a bit grindy at times and the prices for customization and other things are a tad ridiculous 5 for a color pallette to upwards of 50 for some bundles but theres a good core threre
recommended
ths game sux just kiddin this game is epic
recommended
would i recommend this game absofinglutely constantly adding new indepth content warframe will keep you immersed in its galactic scifininja style game go it alone or bring in some friends as you discover your favorite playstyle loadout this is the best ftp game out there as its unique not playtowin and definately not just multiplayer pvp deathmatches though they have it too if you miss them so much
recommended
now i have played games like this all turned out absolute crap but when i played this i was blown away the graphics are great even if you turn them down to low the gameplay is so much fun if you want to make extra fun bring in your friends in some coop i highly recommend this game 1010
recommended
ninja play free believeyou wont stealth all day just make your way but shooting and spamming welcome to bugframe

its a fun game to play but unfortunately with out putting a bit of money into it it can get boring and repetitive fast
recommended
it is a really good game for people who want something free and futuristic
recommended
i tried to stomach this game the videos looked good they really do look fun i downloaded jumped into a game with friends and could not stomach close to 1hour it really is boring it does nothing all you do is go from one room to another swinging your sword around that is it graphics are decent with smooth flowing but that is all it has going for it lucky to hell it is free because if this had a price i think i would pull my hair out requesting a refund urgently because it is mind numbingly boring i suggest leaving it alone maybe give it ago but then youll see what i mean it has no story most things are buy for better stuff but it all seems to do the same effect the character moves weird and makes me feel sick a little anyway nope not for me
recommended
its left 4 dead with space ninjas and a side of rpg
recommended
frieken awesome love every aspect of this crazy shootumuprpgmmostratagykick  game only one con the crafting is a bit annoying
recommended
yes its a fr8 game
recommended
new update makes uranus wet >
recommended
this game is very indepth and even after 70 hours of game time and many hours reading the wiki the game still has some parts i dont fully understand yet the community is always helpful and funny really better than a lot of gaming communities out therethe weapon varieties arent too broad just yet but they should have any weapon type one may need the developers are always updating the game at least once a week so there is usually new content out after some time the prices for the platinum are a bit much but nothing horrible they have to make money somehow but please make sure you are prepared to do some farming for exp and resources one con i must add is the build times for items and dojo structures are relatively too long for my likings but again not horrible overallgreat game for free
recommended
first  great mmo for starters  1110 cuz im a cutie space ninja chan  second  look at how long i played and you can do better  third  prepare a neat drink and some snacks  be sure to be in a comfortable place  and let the grinding begin  everything needs grinding unless youre really good at this game which actually pointless for for me to state cuz i really suck at it  prepare for some rage thanks to the last event  if you were there for it you know how i feel   lastly  remember to enjoy yourselves while playing this game ps  dont keep grinding shet have fun once in awhile

recommended
great game at start things start to get boring after 300played 200 house before connecting my warframe account to steam hours of endless farming to get items that you want but the first 100 hours are amazing the new contents added every update are really fun and if you are the type who like farming for items warframe is one of the best games for you new prime gears and new warframes every major updates or some of the sub updates give an additional 2050 hours to farm all the items so if you wait patiently for the updates warframe could be a never ending fun for you ive quit warframe now but i still enjoyed the hours that ive played in warframe its a great game to get and i also reccommend buying platinum just for weapon and warframe slots
recommended
space ninjas parkour aliens free to play oh dear
recommended
besides tf2 this is the best freee to play game ever beautiful graphices tons of weapons blood and gore but not a lot for the squimesh and i could go on a great game and free
recommended
really good game the graphics are awesome and the amount of weaponry is enourmous with a bit of more bug fixes this game can become really good i wish you could change to first person perspective for more challenging gameplay and for a bit of more realism overall the game is great and i recommend everyone to play it
recommended
cool
recommended
its not a pay to play and play to win gamenice
recommended
warframe is a great thirdperson shooteralthough it has some flaws here and there which is to be expected from a game that is still currently in beta its still a great game to play with friends
recommended
amazing game takes the best of mass effect 3s multiplayer and expands it it is also a nice plus that when you pay for things the devs dont laugh in your face that money is put back into the game and it shows this is the best f2p models out there
recommended
5010 play this game if you like a good grind if you want to feel like superman if you want to oppertunity to kick some  out of paytowin players if you like dismembering things if you want awesome movement mechanics if you want to fly like a badass in space if you like a challenging coop or solo game if you like to craft things if you like to die a lot when playing single player challenging as  if you like really challenging levels with goldplated enemies if you dont want to pay money then get this game pros graphics that kicked skyrims  when it came out you are a ing ninja music that you can tunein or tuneout amazing gameplay and character animations enemies that know how to dodge while you dont you get your own spaceship and its front window is ing amazing its absolutely free and not in any way pay to win you can play it on your  laptop different tilesets between planets constant ing updates cons the fun kind of grindy stuff takes actual time to build good for casual players playing things solo is ing hard

warframe is a space ninja themed farming simulator other recommended games include farmville and farming simulator remember to build your scythe id finish writing this review but theres only 30 more seconds till i can harvest my extractor but for real though its a fun shooter with like a million paygates or you can have insomnia and hope for random events also you have to grind alot alot but its really addicting and the shooty shooty mechanics are good enough to keep you entertained
recommended
nice game
recommended
brillaint free to play
recommended
new update is awesome
recommended
its allright i guess
recommended
very good game great exp system and op weapons everywhere to be found

ninjas farming intense times sums up the game and if you play for a while youll get hooked major downside is you could say pay to win depending on your perspective

recommended
really fun game especially with friends
recommended
aaa quality game and free even with bugs its good 120% recommended
recommended
honestly this game is awesome just give it a try
recommended
so now that i know a bit more ill go more indepth gameplay is varied enough with abilities melee and stealth if you can keep your party in control grind appears very short compared to other games i have played while crafting does have those stupid wait timers it is compensated by the few materials needed to craft items i havent yet delved into the part of the game which relies on random drops from mission rewards though there are many weapons most of which are pretty unique and interesting augmenting weapons with mods is not tedious movement system is okay you can navigate very well in theory but a bad connection will make it clunky enemies within the same faction are somewhat bland but across factions there is enough variety tons of customization almost every color of every piece of equipment you have can be changed but you are limited to a very small palette of slightly bland colors unless you play $5 or wait for a free eventthemed palette to come out graphics are great but framerate is heavily influenced by your connection to the host extreme amounts of mouse acceleration take a bit to get used to but its not that bad after the first hour overall a positive experience i will be playing this for months to come
recommended
this game is very fun to play with your friends a bit like borderlands but less randomness and more tactics  i prefer borderlands p  the diffrent missions can be completed in diffrent ways  you can either come in all guns blazing or do the entire mission by stealth using only your sword after the first missions you might be a bit bored but after a few hours  when you have customized your character to make it personal  you have an arenal that your pleased with  and when you leave mercury because you are always stuck on spaceshipsearth and the other planets are more beautiful to play in  the game will progressively be more fun at some point when you are a reasonable lvl you can raid and do instances  online with random players or just your friends the mod system you mod your weapons so they become stronger is very confusing for begginers but after a while you will get the hang of it  and its preeety dope i recommend this game to everyone 
recommended
really fun and amazing to play with 3 of your friends
recommended
i loved this gamefor about a month i still like it but i just feel it lacks good end game content definitely recommend trying it
recommended
have not played yet but looks good
recommended
       the game is completely necessary to remove the use of machine guns and pistols  it nullifies the style of game you need to create different modes of gameplay level sweep speed stealth maximum damage etc add to the exterior of the characters individual items that are not part of the characters body bags antennas ammunition you need mutch more effects in kills enemies must to do something exept of just walking every enemy each enemy wants something something must to do etc let enemies will be less but every enemy becomes more interesting the enemies have beds and toilets a mess  a sign of life more myths about ninjas in usual gameplay the game will be alittle complicated but more interesting and exciting
recommended
great game but takes some time to get into lots of coop action and exciting gameplay i would easliy name this my favorite game if it werent for the fact that it gets uninstalled from my steam extremely often i reinstalled it before i went to sleep last night only to wake up to it being gone from my steam library once again im quite fed up with this issue please resolve it valve
recommended

its pretty cool i guess
recommended
such awesome game you wanna be in the game
recommended
very good game good graphics many gameplay options still some bugs to be fixed pros  free to play many frames to make many weapons including primary melee and secondary easy controls super powers good npc ai customizable colors for weapons and frames sentinel sidekicks kubrow pets acting like dogs cons  some minor bugs limited and repeated levels i would gladly recommend this game couldnt find any more cons
recommended
amazing game even better as its free d go play it now
recommended
good 3rd person shooter great customisation but my only issue is like most free games nearly all the items cost way too much most have to be bought with converted money to in game points the transaction cost from real money to in game credits is simply silly i would like to give them a bit of money for the game but not at that rate ie 125 in game points is 699 when 125p wont get you a new character 75p is to unlock a colour pallet one of the pallets that said it is still a fun shooter with some interesting moves and a good story line so id say give this game a go
recommended
be a tenno save universe xd craft weapons be a leggend unless you are batmanthen be always batman

dont listen to theses critics on metacritics they judge to much about a game which is still in the beta phase each month comes out a great patch more and more will be added i mean more events over the weekend more blueprints to collect and craft more planets with more levels collect resources to craft items the game has potential we the players tennos have to develop the game with the developers its a good game  > silly metacritics why you listen to those people who thinks they know more about the game then they actualy does
recommended
this game is the best i think saints row 3 and 2 are sort of the same
recommended
has a destiny feel and has the potential to be almost as good
recommended
it gets boring after the first 250 hours edit it never gets boring
recommended
warframe is indefinitely one of my favorite games despite the grindfest it is while it can be a bit repetitive at time the visuals are really good the weapons are versatile and teh warframes are awesome definitely recommended
recommended
a game genuinely like no other amazing production base with always new experiences great crafting system that allows those who dont want to spend real money to get what they want without taking weeks to obtain graphically insane great depth and storyplay very unique 3rd person shooter and definitely one of the most amazing guild system ive ever been able to create and manage truly worth the time highly recommended it is a must

warframe is a freetoplay teambased third person shooter set in a wartorn solar system i couldnt tell you exactly why i was fighting enemy factions or what their motivations were all that was clear was my role as a tenno a sort of space ninja it was my job to shoot andor cut down bad guys destroy their war assets and generally cause havoc for the corpus and grineer despite generally competent gunplay and wellintegrated loot and leveling systems countless flaws and hiccups hinder the games flow warframe never quite outgrows its identity problem  and it never quite hooked me in all tennos have a warframe a sort of superpowered spacesuit as well as access to guns and melee weapons with which to destroy their enemies gear can be modded with loot dropped in the midst of battle or upgraded with platinum the games freemium currency theres no way to earn platinum without shelling out reallife cash so i stuck to upgrading the cheap way  by grinding for hours on lowerlevel maps until my warframe and weaponry were up to par then moving on to tougher fights and new areas
recommended
p cool the kinda game i imagined appeared unexpectedly free to summarise v good
recommended
its a really damn fun game quite high paced at times but all in all a great game its a free to play and you can get most of the weapons through just farming the matiriels so yeah give it a go what have you got the loose eh
recommended
good but need more contentz plz <3 1 star  242354575677687656546542 starz
recommended
grinding or donating pvp bad pve fun
recommended
i dont play this game ba 
recommended
the game is free so you might want to try out warframes solid gameplay mechanics if you have the time to satiate your curiosity just keep in mind that the longer you play the game the more youll likely feel annoyed due to bugs connectivity issues excessive grinding and that one of the hardest parts of the game is probably around the first few days of your game time the community can also be a bit harsh at times  just to prepare you mentally if you can get beyond that id like to recommend you to stick a little while longer
recommended
warframe is an awesome 3rd person mutliplayer coop shooter there is variety of bosses characters and planets i would dislike only the same interior of some maps but when its only an interior its supposed to be on a spaceship so it makes sense why on different planets and same factions are same interiors of ships the exterior of planets is amazing rain snow or sun characters and building there are many characters or warframes usualy you will have to scavange blueprints and parts for it through bosses of some planets but it doesnt take long time to farm but the longest is the building it self parts for warframes 12 hours warframe it self 3 entire days there are 5 factions grineer enemies from earth corpus technologically advanced humans that have a variety of troops and drones orokin corrupted by power and eternal live theese soldiers live longer than every other faction unless you came and kill them all infested all kinds of other factions and some exclusive infested enemies these are things are infected with some sort of biological weapon or virus tenno ancient warriors that fight for freedom and truth and you playing as one of their soldiers tenno are the only ones that can controle the warframes and their power nice things graphics  character and weapons variety  mods that can change entire game  updates that always add a warframe and guns  alerts or time limited mission plus challanges  stalker and other assasins that can suprise you and drop something good if killed not so nice things about this game  long building times that can only be skipped by paying 5$  hard levling up on profile level that rewards you with acces to weapons  sometimes awfull long loading and ping problems unselected   platinum isnt soo needed but you can buy completed weapons and warframes for it also some prime gear i would give this game a perfect score of 97100 cause of its variety and updates that always add something new please if you will notice any mistake feel free to write it down sorry for any mistaked that could i have made your redyd
recommended
warframe is a game that starts a new genre of action games for now it is available in beta which grows very quickly and he are added new warframes weapons and other items as well as items are created a new kind the game itself is quite addictive the idea per game is worth admiration the battle between corus greener and tenno yourself you become one of the tenno featuring new warframe body

i feel reluctant to give a yes or no recommendation for this game in fact i started writing this with a yes but eventually felt compelled to change it to a no the reason is that i love so much about the gameplay and the concept there is so much potential in the idea and existing framework it could be truly great but it has no reward to its rpgesque item grind it exists for its own sake if  like me  you actually dont mind laborious farming to reach a goal which in this case is always to purchase a new weapon or frame ie class then even the grinding for materials is not really a bad thing the real problem with warframe is that  when the combat gameplay is no longer sufficient as its own reward  the grind that is central & the only other motivation to play has absolutely no point as another review aptly described it is at its core a monotonous circular treadmill not just a treadmill a circular one in other treadmill games you at least clear hurdles during one jumping to the next treadmill so to speak  but this one is like a circular treadmill in that you are never anywhere different in terms of progression than the day you start sure you will accumulate a warchest of a crapload of weapons and modifications and classes  but you only ever use one of each in a mission so the more you accumulate the smaller % of what you earned you are using what good is having a thousand options of marginal variation for one thing you can accomplish that thing with just one option you dont need anything more but that is the only progression there is the missions are quite repetitive and quickly consumed content after which your only gameplay is to repeat the missions to acquire loot then use that loot to purchasecraft tools that you will just use to continue grinding loot the grind actually remains reasonable fun as you play around with cool weapons and powers but inevitably you hit the wall where you realize you are essentially just farming for the ability to farm some more  just with a shiny new weapon grind grind grind get a new weapon rinse repeat no competitive system no long term goals no real sense of accomplishment its a shame because the devs work quite hard and provide quite substantial updates on a rapid schedule yet refuse to break away from a business plan of simply adding more things to farm ive actually spoken at length with multiple devs of the game  who are very active in its community & open to feedback  vehemently voicing this concern  but for some reason it has never become a priority for them to create any new macro progression just more of the same i really hope one day this changes so i can return to the game i spent quite a bit of time playing and even quite a bit of cash as i dont mind rushing a few things i really want or supporting development but without a new purpose to playing i will not and continue to regret every penny spent

at first warframe appears to be something new and origional with its spectacular art style and graphics and its entire presentation is a feast for the eyes however after a few hours of gameplay grinding the same spots for the blueprients and materials to create the warframe or weapon you wanted you will wonder to yourself what now do you grind for more gear get some more fancy augments but whats the point when all your fancy warframes and weapons only make you more efficient at grinding for more stuff now i know what youre saying isnt that the basis of any mmo sort off if you boil it down any mmo is one big quest for loot but what makes it good is how fun it is to play all the dungeons and missions to recieve these rewards and warframe fails it it terribly this game becomes far too repetitive you only have a handful of scenarios to play through on missions and the difference between them is barely remarkable youre still fighting baddies through the same spaceship hallways just rearranged each time the warframes themselves are also fundamentally flawed each warframe has a unique set of abilities which three are avaliable from the start and the last only ebing avaliable when your wf is upgraded with an item that is conveniently found in the cash shop sure but you also have a rather limited pool of energy that you expend to use said abilities and said pool can only be replenished by scarce pickups so really yuor style is more defined by what wepaons you have painstakenly constructed by grinding for the materials to make and if you dont like them youre  out of luck not to mention the fact that there is little to no emphasis on teamwork on a multiplayer game i mean they try to do something by making each warframes abilities varied enough to try and do so but if youre not sprinting down a hallway and killing things fast then you end up being more of a burden t the team same thing applies to pvp nothing matters but outright damage and you better built the right warframe for it or its back to more grinding for you then there is the cash shop while every weapon and frame can be built from materials and blueprints dropped in missions which takes ages of grinding you can instantly buy them in the cash shop as well this screams play to win in the most blatant way but since grinding for your equipment is half the game youll probably come to the conclusion that this isnt worth the time faster if you spend a few bucks so despite its flashy looks and first impressions warframe is a huge dissapointment dont get me wrong i wanted this game to be good so badly its an absolute delight to look at and the setting alone is quite good how could you not enjoy what is essentialy a story revolving around an ancient race of alien space ninja but sadly the core gameplay mechanics fall short in what is a flawed game everything is so polished i can see someone forgetting that theyve been running through what is basically the same randomized space ship for hours to find the last few materials for their lazer katana that burns things that it slices through if only art direction could float a game on its own but i suppose if youre going to grind through the same spots for a while they might as well look pretty

bad and boring game

i was enjoying the game it is hard to really aquire anything outside of your starters without either grinding for gear and parts for hours and or just spending money i had put enough time to pretty much max my orignal tenno when i got banned for no reason all was said was i some how violated the eula when i have done nothing wrong in my knowledge i contacted support and said after manual review i did indeed do something to do such was not told what still and said ban could not be lifted glad i never wasted my money on this at this point i will not recommend anygame that bans players without a reasonable explination and violating the eula is not reasonable

now this game is awesome but due to the fact its not server based but instead peertopeer it has extreme connection issues which makes it more frustrating to play then fun

good in certain aspects like the combat but the controls are kinda crappy
not recommended
the gameplay was extremely linear the missions were buggy and to make it worse the storyline is literally just a whole concoction of player theories who have pieced together what they heard from enemies what we were told and lotus unless atleast the gameplay is fixed for me i dont recomend this game
not recommended
where to start with this one well first off i like the ghrapics the gameplay and the abilities however after a couple hours of playing i noticed that the enemies started doing way more damage and i was doing roughly the same as i started out so i decided to look for a new stronger weapon i find out that you cant buy a weapon thats better using the in game credits oh no you have to buy the currency using real money in order to get a decent weapon its that or you can do the facebook style of upgrading buy the blue print play a level a half dozen times to find a resource and then hopefully after a day of grinding you have what you need did i mention the fact you cant kill the enemies even on the first level anymore because their difficulty progressed with you >> so good luck getting those resources yet another potentially great game turned to  from greed i would have much rather paid 5060 bucks for the game and the ability to progress with ingame credits that i didnt have to buy versus having to buy 20 dollars worth of game money for a single weapon really as for those of you who fell victim to that and want to hold onto that pride so to speak of this being a great game it is sure but only for about 45 minutes

warframe seemed to be an interesting space adventure filled with combat and with a new patch it even includes ships im a simple sci fi guy and it was free so i bought it the game was terrible but the controls are probably the worst way to control a charcter i have ever seen e is melee attack while left and right click are to aim while f is to swap beetween your secondary and primary the tutorial if you can even call it that places you with all of your powers depending on which class you play warrior ranger mage but as soon as you leave the room you are left with only the first power you get as i played through the game and fought the generic humanish guys i felt extremly confused due to the starting senistivity being higher than snoop and using e to attack i eventually reached the selection of my first few secondary pistols i was told nothing about these guns so i never knew the difference same with the mele weapons as you can choose a stick guantlets or a sword when i eventually got to a wall running segment i died 10 times not because of my inability to press space but because my faceless avatar would kick off the wall or even better not be able to make a jump the hacking is horrendous think about it this way would you like a timed minigame about 15 sec where you cant go back once you move a puzzle peice unless you flip the peice all over again one that tells you nothing about how to do it and then will cut down the time when you get it halfway done the answer is no by the way did i like this game in short no in long n00000000000000000000 510kill it

i got a problem when i went to pruchase platinum fron the market with a 20% discount that i got from a log in reward so as i said i got the 20% discount and i went trough the process of payment and everything like ive done before but this time something happened that when i added funds to my steam wallet the game registered the purchase but it hasnt charged my bank account or my steam wallet and i havent got my platinum after the purchase i checked my steam wallet and it still shows that the money for the purchase is still there and on the history on my bank account it says that the transaction is peanding after a while when ive purchased platinum before i always receive it when i get back to the game but this time it did not happen and i really hope that this can be fixed because i look at the purchase platinum tab on the games market and it says that i have the discount but when i click on it the deals show that i dont have any discount so yeah im pretty much  that i have not received my platinum and lost the discount anyone that can help me with this ill appreciate it

it is horrible over all 110 at first i was like this is an alright game 610 feeling so far then you get past noob level and the gunskincrafting info is foundshown little uninformative to a new player 3 forms of money and its bottom 510 then you learn that the character levels but you have to do a training mission thing to level you go in there and they do not tell you sht and put you in a circle and then have a ton of enemy spawn in an unrealistic realm worst of all if you fail you have to wait 24 hours to retry even worse still when i got level 1 it said i had to wait like 5 hours to do the training mission what why the duck 110 over all it is a 110 most games i either tell friends it is awesome and they should play it it has good aspects but i can not recommend its okay im not a big fan or i do not like it but this game i might actually tell my friends that it is a bad game and they should not even trial play it ever pretty much burn it with fire dr jackel mr hyde for the nes is a better game lol

worst visual experience ever mouse lags so bad motion blur makes me think im actually blind the first half an hour i didnt know how to play and i was looking at planets because the menus didnt appear until i reset my game really microtransaction based cannot upgrade anything even buy putting in the hours into the game if the currency for the game was cheaper id think about buying some points but its not worth it because everything that requires it is also overpriced

is the gameplay good i honestly have no idea i played the game a while ago and really enjoyed it i decided to get it on steam however when i did this there was a massive camera glitch in the missions the missionworld select screen worked perfectly however the cmera glitched out and i just saw a mesh of green colours i asked in the chat for help and it was full of unsociable and a trolly community i looked through a help section and again had no help maybe if this was sorted out i could have recommended the game but its simply buggy the new patches havent fixed the bug so i guess i just have to do something else until then

im sure this game would be awesome if you could play it this game makes you take a series of steps to even start installing the game first download from steam then make an acccount then activate that account in email then get the activation key from email then go to the game and enter the activation key then download the updates then log back in again not to mention if you even type your password in wrong once the game blocks your ip for some time so you cant log in what a fricking hassle

even with all unusual style and gameplay this game is terrible because it requires tons of your time to grind so you can get decent itemsmods and become a player who worth something my favorite weapons was nerfed new classes overpowered and old ones was nerfed hard this game was made to suck money because without donation you will waste many hours of trying to complete missions you want or get items you need with money in your pocket you can easily get everything and turn on easy mode ive played long time ago and it was decent there was of course one of the starting classes that could win everything in solo but the rest of them was useful now everything changed in a bad way i am very disappointed

my friends have been going on and on about this game for a little over a year now and so i thought id try it out no thanks its really dry maps feel cramped it just doesnt seem to move well to me if youre heavier into 3rd person shooters id say go for it but i feel like it was laggy and not worth the space on my hard drive
not recommended
great game lots of fun to bad it comes with to many bugs and crashes and these just take the fun out of the game fix these and i would recommend it but for now i wont
not recommended
its a simple 3rd person shooter that feels like youre playing by yourself even when you arent i got on and played a round alone and it was just lacking something but it was alright then i tried out the online game play and this is where i would take a few things into consideration before using up hard drive space the idea of the game after reading up is that every unit is individual and contributes to the larger team effort in a unique way great concept however it falls so flat that one might believe that it was tossed off the top of the empire state building it turns into a run and outgun frag fest where all you end up doing if trying to get the most kills and score the most loot while leaving everyone else behind the exp has nothing to do with team preformance or teamwork and instead only values the indiviual thus turning what could be a great teamwork experience into super mario party with guns
not recommended
do not buy this game its a great concept with good game mechanics but it is completely ruined by pay to play and more or less all of the interesting items you will never get because the grinding is stupidly tedious also you have this 4 revive a day system so you cannot even grind for long periods of time this game is great but yet another game ruined by micro transactions

warning this game and its studio warframe digitalextreme has sold to perfect world entertainment on july22014 pwe has a long history of bad reputation and not before long warframe will become one of its revenue machine right now they are banning people talking about pwe in forumstream this game has its moments but its time to move on

personally not for me but for a free to play game i can see the appeal sci fi slashershooter
not recommended
if you enjoy repetition grinding a complete lack of a story and boring gunplay to be fun id highly recommend warframe if not id stay away from this game the only good point that this game has going for itself is its rather unique aesthetics but thats about it
not recommended
avoid it is a pay to win
not recommended
game looks interesting and fun but that feeling wont last for too long missions and maps feel extremely repetitive enemies are as well and crafting is an absolute joke taking you days to craft a single thing and finding the materials for what you want will take you weeks sometimes months for very simple items its fun its fastpaced and its full of action though so if you can endure the extremely repetitive gameplay enemies and missions you might like warframe otherwise do stay away from this game

ive decided to rewrite a once good review on this game this is a good fun free game i want to make that known but since putting money into the game and spending my time in it ive been extremely disappointed since then my email is now said to not having a matching profile within the game my character is still there in my old clan but i cannot have access or log onto it the only way to use the websites support is through logging in which it will not allow me to do therefore theyve robbed me of my money and will no longer give me access to my old account something should be done immediately to compensate people whove experianced this such as i have as there is no reason this problem should have occured nor has it with me with any game ive ever played before what had been a good experiance has left me feeling completely robbed

this game has a verry basic tutorial that only teaches you how to swap wepons move and so on but the game has allot of features that it pretty much just throws at you like they are simple and easy to use but they arent also the game is more like a store than a game virtually all of the wepons and warframes will cost you real money

very fun game to play with a lot to do at the start customize anything about your character and buy items via the store the only downside to this game is that as you get towards the end of the game it gets repetitive

my score 4550 i recommend you playing it but heads up before you do the games engine is so up to the evolution and its frequent updates keeps the game smooth and onto its competitive edge like its racing against team fortress 2 its not tf2 alright but its all about being a ninja dude hack and slash go lone wolf or play with your friends doesnt matter kick butt that is even uncover the stories and mysteries behind warframe though in coop however some would really go lone wolf and they would eventually kill the enemies first before you do best to play with buddies at your rank go play with the higher ups to boost up your items and level though overall performance is great just keep an eye on  lone wolf tbags when you play in coop

warframe is by far one of the best f2p games i have ever played in a while the presentation is great the atmosphere the gameplay is fun and addicting it makes you want to constantly evolve your character you can play it with friends or alone with other people online the game developers constantly update the game having in consideration fans feedback which makes for a great and overall fun game if you are looking for a new game to try out and get lost in warframe is definitely a top contender nowadays

i started to play warframe from when it was a beta not from steam back thenreinstalled it recently and already loved it to death back then it was unique and something completely new and different from any mmo i tried it felt like it will grow in a positive way and it did they made such a huge step from the very beginning and sometimes i have a feeling that developers are working 247 nonstop you will never get bored cuz they make something new so often warframe also has one of the nicest community i encountered in my gaming life and devs are also often comunicating with players give away free platinum on livestreams and much more if i had to vote i would give warframe a medal for best mmo right now everything is perfect and nothing makes you so happy as developers who care about your opinion they realy do ps proud to be a veteran of this game

one of the best coop games thats also free  with micro but you can easily play without paying any money  recommended and seal of approval

the premise of the game is a little odd and the plot is well dry boring and best ignored unless you like obscure and wierd space drama so moving on the game play has alot of innovative ideas poorly implemented so lets start with the big elephant in the room the free to play set up of the game is a pharce without spending real money on platinum or items you are at a huge disadvantage gear  experience and money come slow grinding not a little slow but insanely slow two weeks of playtime my gear is all around level 10 and everyone keeps telling me it gets better so why suffer through crappy game play to get to end game content that once again favors people who are willing to dump real money in the game ahh spend money yourself you say well heres my counter when you swing weapons they follow a static path much like an old style mortal kombat game meaning things like hills or rocks or a slight incline will cause your melee weapon to whiff secondly try wall running or duck jumping again confounded by terrair rocks poor control and slight inclines and finally the deal breaker  mission types certain missions like say the spy missions  wretched at best where one twitchy mob or missclick causes mission failure now throw into that ability missfires and buggy mobs are just part of the game im not talking about stuff that you can compensate with skill over im talking about the game randomly screwing you because of crappy code hmm i shot the dude on the alarm yet he triggered it after he died well balls or my favorite running an extermination mission and the wildlife attacks him and knocks him into terrain making it impossible for me to complete the mission and my final beef with the game is its revive system limited revives that you have to spend real money on to refresh or you fail on missions because youre out of revives when your randomly screwed over with a bug deal breaker this game should not be played by anyone unless this sort of half arsed game design is your niche

grind so you can get more equipment to grind in level design that rivals halo 1 in terms of most amount of copypasting its got better polish than your average f2p game the content is pretty expensive and also subjectively pay 2 win because path of exile or dota 2 could have done the same thing poe could have charged for uniques and dota for hero unlocks except they only charge for cosmetics path of exile is a coop pve game too in warframe you either cough up the cash or spend eternity grinding to grind some more its pretty much single player because theres no communication and most players tend to just hit the sprint  crouch button to reach the objective rather than collecting resources you are forced to chase them as they reach the only coop feature of the game where two players are need to hit a switch together to open a door here is a quick explaination of the gameplay you have an overview of our solar system you start at mercury each planet has a particular amount of missions before you proceed to the next planet planets also consist of resources which drop from killed enemies or cratesstorage in a nutshell you do coop missions which are bland grind items credit and resources purchase blueprints with the virtual credit each item requires certain resources for the sake of this review lets say i want to craft a rhino warframe it requires w x y z resources refer to the solar system map and see which planet has those resources now mercury will have z jupiter has y and pluto has w you will have to play missions even repeat them to aquire the neccessary resources once you do gather the resources you have to wait 1224 hours in real time for the foundry to craft the weapon this is nothing more than a way to nudge you reminding you that the game is free to play with inconvienience free to play really is a tainted model unless its path of exile and dota 2 and loadout where it actually works i rather cough up 2949$ to play a full experience all hostility aside the game has potential and digital extremes is a talented company considering they did ut1999 03 04 and dark sector the controls and graphics are fantastic get rid of the buy to unlock model and look at path of exiles as a blue print also for those who are complaining about wasting money on this game to only be dissapointed 2030 hours later its not the developers fault its the risk you take when you decide to invest in open betas and f2p give this game a try or try its prequel single player dark sector which was an underrated game by digital extreme

a bunch of my coworkers rave about this game to no end so i decided to hop on and try it good thing it is free to play or i would be asking for my money back though there is the option to play the game solo this is not a first person game this is an shooter mmo set in space if you want to play alone the game lets you but does not scale down the difficulty in one mission where i was supposed to prevent an artifact from being destroyed i found myself up against 30 baddies with lasers and grenades while all i had was a rifle and a pistol with no ammo needless to say i died alot and the game was ohso happy to keep track of just how often that was you are given a limited number of chances to revive the games fancy word for respawn but it does not have the decency other games have to moves you away from the mob of baddies that just killed you instead it drops you right in the middle of them only giving you control after it is done with the respawn animation but allowing the baddies to fill you with bullets as soon as the animation starts once your designated respawns have been used you cannot continue playing the game you can buy respawns however for platinum but that is currency you have to buy with real money you dont earn it the controls are a bit wonky moving the mouse moves the camera all the time and the direct your character is running about 45% of the time you only start with a rifle and a pistol though ammo for all the different weapon types drop from baddies and can be found in chests the baddies however can use what every type of weapon they want and have no problem shooting you when you are behind cover they also can stun lock you just by hitting you with the butt of their gun which leave you open to attacks that can take away all of your shield or half your health before you get a chance to run if you want more weapons you have to buy them with platinum and im not 100% certain you actually buy them i think you buy the designs to build them should you find the parts later on x is the defaut do the thing i need you to do button but the promt to do said thing either doesnt appear or appears in the smallest font the game can access i died several times because i was suppsed to access or hack or interface or something with a console and it would not let me until i stood exactly where it wanted me to stand and by then all the baddies had respawned and knocked me down to 2 hp there is also a foundry the games crafting system but you dont have any designs available to you at the start of the game that uses the materials you find in the starting missions you get mods that boost your health melee damage gun damage etc you for some reason you are only allowed to equip mods that have the same number as your level and once you do you cant equip one that when added to the values of your other mods is over your level for example you are allowed one free mod which is actually a power of your suit at level 3 i was allowed to equip a mod that increased my health by 40% at level 6 i thought i could instal another power mod so i could stop dying but i was stopped by an annoying little buzz sound as my level bar flashed the new power was for level 6 but if i wanted to use it i had to remove the level 3 mod and instal it by itself i could however install another level 3 mod but when i tried that i got buzzed again because it i could not have two mods of the same type ie two health mods active at the same time i know i am going to be told if you play with others then you wont have these problems why dont you play with others answer because i want to know what my character can do before jumping into a random matchup so as to try and avoid the ineffitable omg you are so bad at this stop playing youre ruining this for the rest of us you usually run into in mmos also if the game is meant to be an mmo i dont think they should give the player the option of playing solo because then you get players like me who think hey i can play abit by myself so when my friend come online to play i will be a better teammate becoming upset and writing bad reviews

i feel reluctant to give a yes or no recommendation for this game in fact i started writing this with a yes but eventually felt compelled to change it to a no the reason is that i love so much about the gameplay and the concept there is so much potential in the idea and existing framework it could be truly great but it has no reward to its rpgesque item grind it exists for its own sake if  like me  you actually dont mind laborious farming to reach a goal which in this case is always to purchase a new weapon or frame ie class then even the grinding for materials is not really a bad thing the real problem with warframe is that  when the combat gameplay is no longer sufficient as its own reward  the grind that is central & the only other motivation to play has absolutely no point as another review aptly described it is at its core a monotonous circular treadmill not just a treadmill a circular one in other treadmill games you at least clear hurdles during one jumping to the next treadmill so to speak  but this one is like a circular treadmill in that you are never anywhere different in terms of progression than the day you start sure you will accumulate a warchest of a crapload of weapons and modifications and classes  but you only ever use one of each in a mission so the more you accumulate the smaller % of what you earned you are using what good is having a thousand options of marginal variation for one thing you can accomplish that thing with just one option you dont need anything more but that is the only progression there is the missions are quite repetitive and quickly consumed content after which your only gameplay is to repeat the missions to acquire loot then use that loot to purchasecraft tools that you will just use to continue grinding loot the grind actually remains reasonable fun as you play around with cool weapons and powers but inevitably you hit the wall where you realize you are essentially just farming for the ability to farm some more  just with a shiny new weapon grind grind grind get a new weapon rinse repeat no competitive system no long term goals no real sense of accomplishment its a shame because the devs work quite hard and provide quite substantial updates on a rapid schedule yet refuse to break away from a business plan of simply adding more things to farm ive actually spoken at length with multiple devs of the game  who are very active in its community & open to feedback  vehemently voicing this concern  but for some reason it has never become a priority for them to create any new macro progression just more of the same i really hope one day this changes so i can return to the game i spent quite a bit of time playing and even quite a bit of cash as i dont mind rushing a few things i really want or supporting development but without a new purpose to playing i will not and continue to regret every penny spent

at first warframe appears to be something new and origional with its spectacular art style and graphics and its entire presentation is a feast for the eyes however after a few hours of gameplay grinding the same spots for the blueprients and materials to create the warframe or weapon you wanted you will wonder to yourself what now do you grind for more gear get some more fancy augments but whats the point when all your fancy warframes and weapons only make you more efficient at grinding for more stuff now i know what youre saying isnt that the basis of any mmo sort off if you boil it down any mmo is one big quest for loot but what makes it good is how fun it is to play all the dungeons and missions to recieve these rewards and warframe fails it it terribly this game becomes far too repetitive you only have a handful of scenarios to play through on missions and the difference between them is barely remarkable youre still fighting baddies through the same spaceship hallways just rearranged each time the warframes themselves are also fundamentally flawed each warframe has a unique set of abilities which three are avaliable from the start and the last only ebing avaliable when your wf is upgraded with an item that is conveniently found in the cash shop sure but you also have a rather limited pool of energy that you expend to use said abilities and said pool can only be replenished by scarce pickups so really yuor style is more defined by what wepaons you have painstakenly constructed by grinding for the materials to make and if you dont like them youre  out of luck not to mention the fact that there is little to no emphasis on teamwork on a multiplayer game i mean they try to do something by making each warframes abilities varied enough to try and do so but if youre not sprinting down a hallway and killing things fast then you end up being more of a burden t the team same thing applies to pvp nothing matters but outright damage and you better built the right warframe for it or its back to more grinding for you then there is the cash shop while every weapon and frame can be built from materials and blueprints dropped in missions which takes ages of grinding you can instantly buy them in the cash shop as well this screams play to win in the most blatant way but since grinding for your equipment is half the game youll probably come to the conclusion that this isnt worth the time faster if you spend a few bucks so despite its flashy looks and first impressions warframe is a huge dissapointment dont get me wrong i wanted this game to be good so badly its an absolute delight to look at and the setting alone is quite good how could you not enjoy what is essentialy a story revolving around an ancient race of alien space ninja but sadly the core gameplay mechanics fall short in what is a flawed game everything is so polished i can see someone forgetting that theyve been running through what is basically the same randomized space ship for hours to find the last few materials for their lazer katana that burns things that it slices through if only art direction could float a game on its own but i suppose if youre going to grind through the same spots for a while they might as well look pretty

bad and boring game

i was enjoying the game it is hard to really aquire anything outside of your starters without either grinding for gear and parts for hours and or just spending money i had put enough time to pretty much max my orignal tenno when i got banned for no reason all was said was i some how violated the eula when i have done nothing wrong in my knowledge i contacted support and said after manual review i did indeed do something to do such was not told what still and said ban could not be lifted glad i never wasted my money on this at this point i will not recommend anygame that bans players without a reasonable explination and violating the eula is not reasonable

now this game is awesome but due to the fact its not server based but instead peertopeer it has extreme connection issues which makes it more frustrating to play then fun

two words pure awesomeness now where do i begin the smooth gameplay the amazing and beautiful design the simple and streamlined ui this game has everything pros great ui smooth gameplay beautiful design tight controls nice and helpful community good syndicate system deep and mostly unknown lore easy to navigate menus easy to spend more than one hundred hours on easy to use foundry system useful upgrading system new content added like every month idontknow cons slightly annoying realmoney system though most things minus frames can be purchased for under 20 dollars or built in the foundry frames inclueded slight difficulty spike if you dont know what you can handle overall i rate this game a 98 out of 10 with some slight and acceptable flaws this game presents itself with grace digital extremes has done a wonderful job and new updates are released very often i wouuld recomend installing this game immediately and slowly whittling away at your social life with the days you will spend playing this game and if you need help with the game just add me dunlord1213 or later it will be changed to either zircon zircon _zircon_ or zircon1

a fairly exceptional game that does f2p how it should be free to play there are select items that cost cash but a majority of items are earned through actual gameplay but you can pay for colours cause reasons

this is my life my game

even with all unusual style and gameplay this game is terrible because it requires tons of your time to grind so you can get decent itemsmods and become a player who worth something my favorite weapons was nerfed new classes overpowered and old ones was nerfed hard this game was made to suck money because without donation you will waste many hours of trying to complete missions you want or get items you need with money in your pocket you can easily get everything and turn on easy mode ive played long time ago and it was decent there was of course one of the starting classes that could win everything in solo but the rest of them was useful now everything changed in a bad way i am very disappointed
