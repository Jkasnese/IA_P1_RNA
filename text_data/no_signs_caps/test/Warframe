its been almost two years since i first played warframe andi thought id update my review considering how much the game has changed mostly for the better the core philosophy of being a magic space ninja and juggling melee attacks ranged combat and special abilities still makes up the core of the game while none of these aspects are particularly brilliant on their own combined they greate some seriously entertaining emergent gameplay switching between these forms of combat adds in a lot of variety and helps keep things fresh even hundreds of hours in game more advanced players can perform manuvers like zorencoptering while sprinting jump then crouch and use a melee attack to gain extra mobility the games arsenal has also become much more interesting as digital extremes has rounded out the arsenal by continously adding in exotic weapons we have unique guns including a tentacle shotguna freeze raya flak cannon a wristmounted laser beam and more messing around with all of the weapons and discovering which ones you enjoy playing with is always fun the game now has over 20 different warframes classes allowing you to play pretty much any role you want from a melee berserker to a stealthy assassin thanks to some great visual design pretty much all of the warframes are fun to play as and discovering which one suits your playstyle best is a great experience <3 rhino the overall aesthetic of the game is quite striking as well all of the frames have their own unique visual flair the paladin oberon has a long slender body with very natural deerlike look combined with some nice japanese and scifi flair even 500 hours in the game is still incredible to look at the soundtrack and audio design are great especially if youre into pewpew scifi sound effects although many of the abilities sound quite powerful that being said you will probably want to play your own music after a couple of dozen hours into the game since the soundtrack does tend to repeat itself now lets talk about one of the games biggest strengths and weaknesses the grind like diablo or destiny warframe is a game all about grind you grind resources to craft weapons grind resources to level up mods grind planets to obtain frameweapon drops etc for the most part the grind is reasonable and rather enjoyable due to the strength of the games combat even hundreds of hours into the game i still had a blast zipping around the maps and picking off enemies with my insanely specced out weapons and warframes however at times the grind can be overwhelming as you try to unlock that one specific part that you need to complete a warframe or a gun only to get something completely useless instead also ranking up level 10 mods can be an extreme chore to this day i do not have any rank 10 mods on me that being said the grind never feels too overwhelming like in other f2p games ive played before and paying to circumvent the grind really isnt necessary in warframe another one of my complaints concerns the massive power creep in warframe since de churns out so much content in such a quick amount of time many of the warframes weapons will be either extremely weak or extremely powerful to the point where several hotfixes are needed to get them to a decent shape assuming they are patched for example sniper rifles are worse than bows in most cases shotguns suffer from heavy damage falloff and long reloads and frames that dont offer utility such as crowd control healing buffs etc and focus on dealing raw ability damage suffer greatly the game definitely needs a large balance patch to work out these issues my third complaint is that warframe doesnt seem to be going towards one direction de is focused so much on adding new content haphazardly that its difficult to see where the game is going to this day there is no campaign only a handful of small quests there is no real endgame as it mostly consists of endless mission types i have to wonder if were ever going to get more meaningful content as the current mission types feel all the same kill a bunch of enemies but with specific conditions such as capturing a target rescuing a hostage etc plus mission objectives rarely vary so if youve played one extermination mission youve played them all and the same with the other mission types finally the game does an awful job of explaining itself even with the new tutorial the game does not explain all of its mechanics properly and throws new players into the open with little advice consulting the games wiki or recruitingregion chat will make the experience for new players a much more enjoyable one so despite all of my complaining i enjoy warframe quite a bit at the end of the day its a fun game that has a great variety in content and allows players to pretty much choose how they play and set their own pace its a very fair f2p game so theres little reason to not give it a shot tldr  good aesthetic  fun combat  weapon and class diversity  mostly fun grinding  very generous f2p model  grind can be overwhelming at times  power creep  lack of story content and end game  mission types feel very similar  poorly explains itself

to anyone who has played mass effect 3s multiplayer mode in the past  i have to say this is what i wish mass effects multiplayer mode wouldve been like in mass effect you had your specific races in waframe you kinda play as one race the whole time but each tenno has their own specific abilities and perks to help you get the edge over countless enemies thrown at you and really helps make you feel like a total badass you can even further enhance your warframes with the mods that are dropped from enemies as you complete missions from planettoplanet these mods can help with consuming less energy so you can use powers helluva lot more frequently or make the effects last longer more powerful and add so many ways to change your preffered playstyles offering so much replayability especially with friends remember all those times when you werent able to jump in mass effect and instead only givng the option to jump down a certain ledge while getting chased by hordes of banshees phantoms & collectors well in warframe you can go all parkour wall running across huge gaps to evade enemy fire wall jumping to reach highersecret rooms the amount of places to use parkour is astounding if you use your imagination and experiment i could go on & on about the added features and content theyve added over the course of its life which is still considered in beta by the way but overall i think this was the game ive been longing for and i really enjoyed my time with the me3s multiplayer experience myself which definitely left me feeling hungy for a more enjoyable coop game like warframe has provided for me did i forget to mention this thing is freetoplay give it a spin and you might just find yourself spending too much of your time in this game xd

lets go ahead and describe warframes plot in the most simplest form youre a ninja in space ok reviews over go home wait youre still reading this alright fine lets keep it going frames at war is a thirdperson action shooter space ninja simulator where you and up to three other players test your mettle against three woefully unprepared factions the space merchants heavy metal russians and the zerg you battle through waves upon waves of commuters on their way to workhome to provide forsee their families and sliceblastshoot them to little pieces in your magical supermanwoman body suit with your crazy monofilamentvibrobladeanthrax dispensers which you can purchase blueprints for or you can find parts in goldfingers space palaces to create blinged out versions of them speaking of blinged out things this game is free to play but actually done well you can almost get anything in this game without spending any money at all and not feel jaded at the massive time youve wasted doing so that is until you want to feel special and buy a buttload of cosmetics at that point you can either blow money on platinum or have some other dumb sucker do the same to buy junk from you in the trade channel what i take away from the whole experience is that youre a monster who hurts people for fun and profit i really like this game

its a 3rd person actionshooter with a fair emphasis on the grind a lot of ppl will be put off by the rng nature of some of the items that you have to farm but at the same time if you go into this with a few friends the game can be extremely fun keep in mind im also a huge fan of monster hunter so my opinion is a tad bias in that regards the cash shop isnt game breaking and it gives ppl without a lot of time on their hands a chance to keep up with those that play this game too much all in all if you enjoy 3rd person action games i would recommend that you look into this one just keep in mind that to get to a lot of the end game stuff youre either going to pay for it or invest a fair amt of time into it

i can highly recommend this game to people who like third person shooters it is a freerun very good movement to get quickly around the maps cop ninja space hackn slash shooter it has many different areas and in each area it generates a new order of chambers to make the completion run slightly different every time also its free to play so why wouldnt you try it out the pvp isnt really great but it is mostly a cop pve game anyway this game is much about farming resources and bleuprints for new equipment weapons and suitscharacters there is a trading system in game to make getting the prime bleu prints easier you can ofcourse spend money on additional stuff it isnt a pay to win game that isnt necesarry to do so by using trading you can get even those items anyway but itll take way longer ofc i played this game for more then 1120 hours and i never spend any real money on it if you become really good in playing and speeding trough missions it can become kind of a bore and annoyance to drag noob players across the map if i play a non t4 mission with players that are not on my friend list 99% of the games i play will result in me having done more 90% of all damage and me waiting at a door that needs 2 players to open also there is not really much of an end game and if you want to play this game for melee mostly then dont its a shooter at the point of writing this review melee is obsolete even for characters that are based around melee conlusion its good and free by far my most played game on steam

i figured i ought to review this dynasty space ninjas of hellgate london its pretty good for what you get at any rate ive spent about twenty dollars into this game by now and i can honestly say i dont feel like its been wasted time its a pretty grand game all things considered its simple easy to get into and the controls dont usually make me feel like a blind man groping for spilled change at any rate its grindy boring at times but its worth the occasional jump into for a purely cooperative experience dont you miss that when games were purely coop or had a coop focus i miss that what a shame

warframes concept when presented to the normal person would seem unusual or unappealing this can be forgiven since the concept is space ninjas on a solar mission of fighting giant brutes and strange merchantmen whilst holding back the invading forces of a mysterious infestation yet this game has proven to be hundreds of hours of fun for myself and my friends who would play it the ability to go through a procedurally generated map while shooting grineer platoons in a defense or slashing apart an infested swarm in a survival mission has produced unlimited amounts of fun the game gives the player an ultimate suit of armor which grants them unimaginable power as they run jump slide kick shoot grapple punch stab and slash at enemies who give the player an actual challenge the content is even more extrordinary as it is updated very often and is largely influenced by the community thus every player has a direct voice in what they want the developers to put in next thus for a game overflowing with action adventure community and a sheer uniqueness not commonly found in the typical selection of modern games warframe should definitely be on the consumers list did i also mention that it is free
recommended
really good game worth the time for the beginners i enjoyed this game for around three weeks before getting bored of it
recommended
i have well over 700 hours of gameplay and rising this game is very fun and can be very addicting it has its ups and downs but first ill go over the ups an obvious up is that its free to play so you can try it out and if it doesnt fit youre gaming style then just uninstall with it being free to play theres obviously going to be microtransactions but let me asure you that there is nothing in warframe you cant get including nearlly all cosmetics even if you dont put a dime into the game i havnt payed any money at all and i have some of the best gear and a hand full of the cosmetic items this is due to the fact you can trade in game items for microtransaction currency for warframe its called platnium as far as game graphics they are amazing not far cry 4 graphics but definitely one of the best free to play game graphics iv seen dont let that discourage you if you dont have a high end gaming computer the game is suprising very optimized and the devs work to improve it even more the gunplay is as great with a third person run and gun parkour style aside from guns there are also tons of melee weapons that are just as strong not just a last resort if you run out of ammo the depth of melee combat is amazing collect different melee stances as you progress to match youre play style perform combos with the different stances to cut down youre enemies and one of the best things about warframe is the devs the devs are super active and constantly pumping out content as well as streaming on a weekly bases their passion for the game is like none other ok so the bad things about warframe repetition this has been a problem for the game for quite some time and the devs are doing alot to fix this after playing for as long as someone like me or even far less warframe will feel like a chore this can obviously be prevented by playing with freinds or doing unconventional mission play styles but can still get kind of dull this is something the devs are taking alot more seriously and they have talked about various ways to improve this i personally think that the devs can acomplish something to ease or fix this the second thing bad about warframe is timed events so what i mean by this is events that offer special prizes like guns melee weapons or mods mods are items that you put into youre character to give them better stats or abilites each mod has a unique buff will only come once and if not will come much later in the year meaning if there is a gun melee or mod that you really want but wasnt there during the event you cant get it unless its tradable in which case you can trade for with other players over all i love this game and i love the devs they work hard to deliver a great game and it is definitely one of my favorite free to plays if youre still sceptical then just give it a try and see for yourself

do you like a light stealth element and awesome grouping capabilities do you enjoy assassinating your target and vanishing without a trace do you revel in using awesome built in stealth routes and abilities then watch as this game gives you all of those things and your teammates throw it away to instead die multiple times and warn the entire galaxy youre going to kill a boss 1010 would play again

ever play global agenda its similar but a lot better the graphics are incredible the adventure is unspeakable most importantly youre a ninja fighting in space and planets with pets bows guns pistols and most imporantly melee weapons i love the glaive for example i feel like captain america throwing his glaive at an enemy and exploding it killing multiple enemys then grabbing my glaive back to throw again it comes with stance mods and these stance mods let me do different combos with the melee weapons warframe uses a mod system that lets you customize your warframe and weapons in unique and different way that help you against different factions the game has lisets player ships which you can walk around in setup your arsenal before navigating to a planet to fight some grineer or corpus did i mention you can fight in space now i think i did anyway my and my buddy kubrow a cute feriocious beat that you have to take care of explore planets all aroudn the galaxy and i most of the time just sit back while jubu my awesome kubrow rips off grineer heads and limbs and tosses them aside hes very nice if you get know him now lets move on to my favortie part of the game the dojo the clan i have my own dojo 100 rooms i kinda maxed out i cant build any more rooms haha filled with labs which let you make custom weapons you cant get from anywhere else i have dueling rooms which lets me and my clan members duel each other i have my main room which we spawn in and an observatory attached to it i occasionally do my homework while sitting there and looking at the beautiful galaxy there are spots you can meditate on in the observatory room i believe theyre even gonna bring a shooting range eventually for dojos so you can test out your weapons and see which one you like the most i think ive talked enough time to play warframe and join my clan 1916 rangers i hope you found this review helpful i love this game and i would love it if you joined and played it with me cheers

pro  two primary weapons  you could unleash fiery maelstroms turn invisible create a decoy use teleportation to switch places with an enemy or manipulate your foes to fight against their allies  you can run warframe missions with up to three other players  the inventory management includes tools for crafting items out of materials that can be bought or dropped during gameplay  social  character models and animations are very impressive  progresses through the solar system  great audio feedback  free to play  update after update  over 100 achievements contra  space ninja suit  repetitive maps and missions conclusion understandably its important to provide motivation to keep running the levels but the fun of loot drop systems comes from finding something new and shiny that makes your avatar look cool instead warframe gives you another crafting component
recommended
this game is so awesome it gave me 3 erections in a row the gameplay is awesome the graphics of wich i care less than a  are good this game is one of my top 3
recommended
all you need to know about this game is that the combat is amazing there are a few glitches overall but the fluidity of the combat is something to behold this is really the reason to play this game the leveling system and ability to modify and customize your weaponry and warframes is also quite addictive id also mention that playing with two person teams is ideal for most missions and more fun generally playing with four people turns into complete chaos and at least imo makes the game much less fun the main gripe against this game is that its repetitive and the grind for certains modspartsetc can be kind of daunting and boring after the shock and amazement of the combat wears off will take a long time you realize you arent really accomplishing much  just like other mmos outside of wow which does a good job of constantly giving you a new story to unfold the issue could be resolved with more oddball events maybe even massive invasion missions with thousands to slaughter etc i find that the game shines the brightest when you face wave after wave of enemy that you can cut up into tiny pieces or as an ember ignite the world on fire and melt their faces its really satisfying trust me but when you get stuck doing really drawn out missions like mobile defense the game gets kind of tedious i also find that while most of the warframes are incredibly fun to play  they are not well balanced like nova for example is way too powerful and frames like frost zephyr or excalibur are not really effective fun but not effective for moving along in the game often if playing with friends one or two people will kill like 70% of the stuff and run around doing so while the two others will spend time collecting loot and hoping they arent shot in the face by heavy grineer infected or corpus units with all of that said i do recommend the game because its a lot of fun to build new weaponsframesresearch abilities and get out there and kick some butt just beware of the horrible team gameplay due to imbalance and the repetitive nature of the missions perhaps in the future they will create missions that require more cohesive gameplay but until then just have fun slicing things into tiny bloody bits or shooting holes through their torsos with shotguns because it will make you grineer to ear done intentionally also i should mention that this game is not p2w at all but it doesnt hurt to buy some platinum from time to time if you want to proceed faster than the game otherwise allows clearly the system is rigged in favor of profits but if you know that going in youll be better able to handle it

okay where to start to all the people looking at my hours yeah i know i played this game on the website client alot more before steam onto a dead honest review i have been playing this game from before open beta almost a year and a half and i have seen all of its ups and downs this will be honest back in the day you would start off with a choice of 3 warframes either excalibur mr coverboy volt an electric wizard or loki the trickster who loves being invisible back at this time the game was simple you shoot stuff you get xp and mods and you get better right well now there are 20 warframes or so i think and their prime versions superpowered versions certain things avalible in the game back then are not avalible now such as the snipetron sniper rifle and excalibur prime shiny coverboy these items are now no longer avalible ever great news huh there are too many weapons to count and i own almost every one and have playtested every one i own every warframe class except one i could harp for days but lets move to the present classes nonlinear you can play any warframe with a sniper rifle each warframe has its own unique abilities with some warframes more suited to tasks than others modability meaning you can build your warframe for anything you want even if it is not reccomended customisation meaning you can recolor your warframe to your own wants even if its pink very few different skins color packs are pay to play different skins and helmets are pay to play there is an unobtainable warframe excalibur prime weapons tons of choices legitly a thousand plus different combinations there is a tentacle gun different classes of weapons shotguns pistols sniper rifles melee frikin bows customisable yeah pink guns mofo modability modding your guns for different stuffs yeah most model designs look amazing very few guns have altfire some guns are unavaible to obtain like ever snipetron ect companions puppies fuggin puppies compainions such as little robots or mutants djinn to follow you around and shoot stuff very few varients 4 dog classes and 7 companions most are useless in combat unless putting work into it not including dogs dog companions take an amazing ammout of time and effort to obtain controls fluent non choppy controls combo keys for different reactions ingame ie wallrunsliding melee attack no input lag even for lowerend computers you press w and you walk forward god darn it easy to get used to control setup is slightly unorthodox level design each level is randomly generated from a selection and tileset of rooms each type of faction has its own level designs no level is the same unless you have played like 10000 levels like i have and you got one damn one that was the same the tileset of rooms gets repetive some areas bug out the map graphics ambient atmosphere when needed physics can be hilarious i have 10 hrs of playtime just pinning people to the wall enemy design is intresting especially the zombies weapon design is amazing low end computers will have to down the graphics alot economy this is where a checklist is redundant as i may have to rant i will start out by saying that this game is completely free to play and any item in the game is obtainable by putting work into it including the pay to pay items this will hold true throughout my rant although i will probably complain alot in essence this game is run by crafting you craft weapons warframes companions ect there are three kinds of people who play warframe there are the legit f2p players who get everything legitly and obtaining p2p items through trading the second kind of people myself included are the people who have put money into it but not extravagant ammounts usually $10 to around a top of $300 this goes out to you tf2 people and then finally the walletwarriors yes you you know who you are you are those people who have put insane ammounts of money into this game in order to have everything you want then and now i have a friend who has put well over $100000 usd into this game those are the different types of warframe players as stated before this game can be completely f2p but as in almost every f2p spending money makes things faster and gives you an unfair edge for example a f2p gets 30 spaces on a maxed out weapon while a p2p can purchase an item that gives them 60 spaces on the exact same weapon this item can be obtained through trading but can be time consuming there is one thing that all players do and that is grind hollllllyyyy  78 of your hours on this game will be just repeating the same damn mission over and over to get materials yeah grinding other space missions yeah your in space your base is in a spaceship the staff of the game are very understanding and focus more on community wants first than their own wants frickin space ninjas d overall yes this is an amazing game overall the only fallout point is that after playing for a long time it gets very very boring for me i only play this anymore when im asked to by a friend or if a new major update comes out volt prime plz <3 this game is amazing and i still enjoy it but not as much as i used to due to overplaying 1010 ps if any reader has questions feel free to add me i love a good discussion

the game has a steep learning curve if you have played other tps it will be easier to understand it took me a while to get acquainted with it and often i still learn as new things are introduced but with the variety of frames characters with all their own abilities there is a lot to discover craft mod battle pets as kubrows doglike companion pets drones like the sentinel deathcube and they are all with their own mods and customizations frames are divided in the regular frames and the prime frames the differences arent that big mostly estetic with a big bling factor and some extra modded slots this also applies to some weapons from giant mallets to throwing stars and double swords and many  many other weapons to try out to increase your mastery rank mastery rank is your level levelling up your weapons and frames doing missions defeating bosses discovering new planets will earn you experience towards your masterry rank ones your xp bar is full you will able to take a test to advance to the next rank note here that failing a test will put it on a long cooldown and you will be able to take another try the next day so be prepared because some tests will be tricky the key in this game is having patience patience is a golden virtue in gaming especially in this title the game uses an optional payment system almost all weaponry and warframes can be earned in game everything other than founderexclusive items and event retired or prime items however with platinum the grind to obtain weapon and warframe blueprints and their resources is circumvented a player can purchase weaponry from the market for credits although some weapons and all warframes require the schematic to be purchased and then crafted  you can virtually buy everything with platinum i personally advice to starting in an existing clan there are many with a lot of options also starting a clan may appear easy but there is a lot of time to be put into creating a good big working and active clan big investments are made to make those big dojos your clanhouse to a beatiful place to learn new things and its also home for your trades trades can only be done in dojos there is a big community that is willing to answer your questions in the right channels i say the right channel because if you are on the wrong channel doing your thing you get banned from chat there are gms around most of the time that keep an eye on things the people behind the game are very active in bringing hotfixes that often end in another fix to fix the hotfix but things get fixed in the end there is a good vibe and sometimes a joke is made from de events are made to offer players some festival fun and items like bunny ears event color pallets moustache and more also every day you get a login reward that can be a discount xp weapons prints and more free to play at its finest worth playing

extremely fair business model  if you pay in when you have 75% discount  countless hours of grind and repetitive mission but man its fun and cool  go read about the viable modsweaponswarframe and buy plats to trade for those things would save you lots and lots of hours into the game i really recommend you to pay i mean seriously with 50$ i was able to geared up 5 warframes to the max on two accounts  ps i was playing the game as a 2 player coop with my girlfriend who also enjoy the game immensely d ps2 this is the real game with really balanced sex representative and absolutely no sexism overtone no battle bikinis no muscle bulk than question if you even lift every time you look at your character they got different body shapes for each of the warframe take nova for an example thats as realistic and close at it gets to real world body shape cons quite steep learning curve and the depth of character customisation which is paramount in this game  my girlfriend and i wasted 24hours of game time spread over many days getting stuck in many missions _ before we knew that the mods that really matter to the game are serration and elemental damage

 first dont look on my steam hours i downloaded warframe to steam just now i have about 585 hours on the ingame profile warframe is free to play game still in beta but already a decent game that worth a try plot  there is still many question marks not all of the lore revealed so i will tell some of the known story  you are a tenno twisted race who can control a warframe a special suit that gains special powers to the wearer you was awakend from cyro sleep by the lotus we dont know much about her yet she guides you and help you you was awakend in a time of chaos the grineer a cloned race is taking over the system you have to stop them more is explained through the tutorial mission alot of this game is about fun while some players grinding the mastery ranks  a level in typical mmo  i found myself not doing this at all  compare my 580 hours to rank 11 some are already at 16 on this time  this game have large varity of weapons and warframes im taking the weapons that im enjoying to play and playing with them there are alot of unique weapons into this game and there are typical rifles and pistols this game is tps  third person shooter  but combine some ninja elements  wallrunning sneaking even tho it still need rework and as well melee weapons  there are dozens of melee weapons in this game  and that whats make it unique when comparing to other games also about p2p  trading system never paid a single cent now i got 10 warframes all with reactors and dozens of weapon slots just get stuff in void and trade for other players platinum so you want to enjoy find things that fit your playstyle  and there is a huge varity of weapons from lightning gun to rocket launcher from dagger to jet powered hammer  download this game and start to enjoy

ive been playing since update 10 and warframe is nothing short of amazing warframe has evolved from your ordinary somewhat storydriven third person shooter to one of the best f2p games and can possibly rival most games you buy the tenno descendants of an ancient warrior civilization awake from a long slumber to find themselves at war with a horde of cloned humans a protocorporation of humans known for their robot proxies the infested victims of the technocyte plague and the corrupted guardians of the void and only seen in the void warframe is the name of the suit that the tenno wear each suit bears 4 special powers that can change the battlefield in different ways varying from powers that make you invisible for a limited amount of time to stomping the ground with great force tumbling enemies into stasis warframe has a large variety of exotic weapons goofy but exotic designs the maps you consider classic for me the corpus ship and the grineer asteroid can get tiring and repetitive to suppress the repetition updates are released or you make your own fun even though warframe is in beta and still has a few bugs crawling around the system i still consider this as a complete game adding new features like most game developers do when releasing sequels i highly recommend you to download this game and explore the bizarre worlds that warframe has to offer

man compared to a while ago this game grew with leaps and bounds id also recommend prepare to grind as a subtitle

there is one arguement that will be put up to this game pay2win i will say right now that it is not while there are microntransactions everything that contributes to actual gameplay can be acquired through playing the game there is grind in this game putting that out there now because there are people who absolutely despise it i for one do not have a problem with it to be perfectly honest there is alot of grind the good thing is that the gameplay is just so much fun that it is actually enjoyable to play missions and its not just dull shooting ground after dull shooting ground looking at you call of duty one kinda big problem i have with it is the inventory to get more inventory slots you have to pay with platinum the microtransaction currency this causes problems with having weapons and warframes that you like and not having enough room to store them the trading system slightly fixes that problem with being able to trade players for weapon parts mods and warframe parts as well as platinum if you are playing the game and find a really valuable mod you can go to the trading tab and trade with players for it by putting up offers and looking if anyone wants something you might have in summary this is a slightly flawed but really enjoyable game if you dont mind grind and some waiting for things to happen to be honest what game isnt somewhat flawed

its a great game i have to say the atmosphere reminds me of mass effect and the multiplayer of mass effect 3 with grindfest its a hack and slash third person shooter game that its polished and responsive fast paced combat strong tactical elements and good graphics to be perfectly honest this game is really quite addicting that you have to grind items mods etc the best part is that once you reach higher levels this is the part where you do cooperation and strategy to execute the plan the developers are actively adding content to the game which is quite awesome make sure you play this game with your friends since players in the public game are always racing to the extraction point which includes leaving teammates behind doesnt communicate and so on graphics are great and the level of combat is sweet downside is that there is still few bugs left in this game so expect that to happened game is also f2p you can get most of the items in this game by just getting blueprints and so on i recommended this game especially if youre playing with your friends rated 1010

i find warframe very fun and even though you can buy weapons and tennos with the use of real cash you can still play the game using default weapons but i hate the limit of colours for customizing your character past that i do find the game very enjoyable and if your pc can handle high graphical settings then switch it to high its a beautiful looking game

i love this game it is the one that i keep going back too however i recently went back and looked at the new user experience it was not as joyous as i remembered the steps taken to introduce you with the tutorials were better than when i joined but still i understand why so many people feel it is just too bewildering hopefully with the new user experience finally getting some major tlc this is going to make the whole process much more intuitive the most striking thing to me was how little damage the initial set of weapons do and how few useful mods drop early on i got through the opening missions on mercury with others my experience on these levels aided that but the step up to venus was horrendous the osprey shields made trying to kill anything a chore i was forced to go back and repeatedly run missions to rank up the mods i had managed to collect however once you break through and get to earth this is when the game truly shines better mods drop which made the whole game seem more palatable the graceful movement within game is beautiful the addition of melee 20 has added a whole new dimension to the game making melee both viable and more importantly fun it is worth the effort to perservere and to get fully acquainted with the mechanics of the game it opens up a world of possibilities the continual development is widening the scope of gameplay with each update definitely recommend accruing major game time

for a free to play game this game is absolutely worth it the graphics are amazing the gameplay is superb and it is downright fun to play there are some downsides though for one you really are gonna have to spend alot of time grinding for new frames etc trust me when i mean alot i mean alot if you are gonna download this game you are gonna have to dedicate some of your time into this still for a free to play game its absolutely superb ]

warframe is a great cooperative game with many gamemodes difficulties customization warframes and weapons it doesnt bore me at all however it is very grindy and repetitive and so it may bore some players cough casuals cough overall the game looks great runs smoothly and is a ton of fun get it its free

i feel reluctant to give a yes or no recommendation for this game in fact i started writing this with a yes but eventually felt compelled to change it to a no the reason is that i love so much about the gameplay and the concept there is so much potential in the idea and existing framework it could be truly great but it has no reward to its rpgesque item grind it exists for its own sake if  like me  you actually dont mind laborious farming to reach a goal which in this case is always to purchase a new weapon or frame ie class then even the grinding for materials is not really a bad thing the real problem with warframe is that  when the combat gameplay is no longer sufficient as its own reward  the grind that is central & the only other motivation to play has absolutely no point as another review aptly described it is at its core a monotonous circular treadmill not just a treadmill a circular one in other treadmill games you at least clear hurdles during one jumping to the next treadmill so to speak  but this one is like a circular treadmill in that you are never anywhere different in terms of progression than the day you start sure you will accumulate a warchest of a crapload of weapons and modifications and classes  but you only ever use one of each in a mission so the more you accumulate the smaller % of what you earned you are using what good is having a thousand options of marginal variation for one thing you can accomplish that thing with just one option you dont need anything more but that is the only progression there is the missions are quite repetitive and quickly consumed content after which your only gameplay is to repeat the missions to acquire loot then use that loot to purchasecraft tools that you will just use to continue grinding loot the grind actually remains reasonable fun as you play around with cool weapons and powers but inevitably you hit the wall where you realize you are essentially just farming for the ability to farm some more  just with a shiny new weapon grind grind grind get a new weapon rinse repeat no competitive system no long term goals no real sense of accomplishment its a shame because the devs work quite hard and provide quite substantial updates on a rapid schedule yet refuse to break away from a business plan of simply adding more things to farm ive actually spoken at length with multiple devs of the game  who are very active in its community & open to feedback  vehemently voicing this concern  but for some reason it has never become a priority for them to create any new macro progression just more of the same i really hope one day this changes so i can return to the game i spent quite a bit of time playing and even quite a bit of cash as i dont mind rushing a few things i really want or supporting development but without a new purpose to playing i will not and continue to regret every penny spent

at first warframe appears to be something new and origional with its spectacular art style and graphics and its entire presentation is a feast for the eyes however after a few hours of gameplay grinding the same spots for the blueprients and materials to create the warframe or weapon you wanted you will wonder to yourself what now do you grind for more gear get some more fancy augments but whats the point when all your fancy warframes and weapons only make you more efficient at grinding for more stuff now i know what youre saying isnt that the basis of any mmo sort off if you boil it down any mmo is one big quest for loot but what makes it good is how fun it is to play all the dungeons and missions to recieve these rewards and warframe fails it it terribly this game becomes far too repetitive you only have a handful of scenarios to play through on missions and the difference between them is barely remarkable youre still fighting baddies through the same spaceship hallways just rearranged each time the warframes themselves are also fundamentally flawed each warframe has a unique set of abilities which three are avaliable from the start and the last only ebing avaliable when your wf is upgraded with an item that is conveniently found in the cash shop sure but you also have a rather limited pool of energy that you expend to use said abilities and said pool can only be replenished by scarce pickups so really yuor style is more defined by what wepaons you have painstakenly constructed by grinding for the materials to make and if you dont like them youre  out of luck not to mention the fact that there is little to no emphasis on teamwork on a multiplayer game i mean they try to do something by making each warframes abilities varied enough to try and do so but if youre not sprinting down a hallway and killing things fast then you end up being more of a burden t the team same thing applies to pvp nothing matters but outright damage and you better built the right warframe for it or its back to more grinding for you then there is the cash shop while every weapon and frame can be built from materials and blueprints dropped in missions which takes ages of grinding you can instantly buy them in the cash shop as well this screams play to win in the most blatant way but since grinding for your equipment is half the game youll probably come to the conclusion that this isnt worth the time faster if you spend a few bucks so despite its flashy looks and first impressions warframe is a huge dissapointment dont get me wrong i wanted this game to be good so badly its an absolute delight to look at and the setting alone is quite good how could you not enjoy what is essentialy a story revolving around an ancient race of alien space ninja but sadly the core gameplay mechanics fall short in what is a flawed game everything is so polished i can see someone forgetting that theyve been running through what is basically the same randomized space ship for hours to find the last few materials for their lazer katana that burns things that it slices through if only art direction could float a game on its own but i suppose if youre going to grind through the same spots for a while they might as well look pretty

bad and boring game

i was enjoying the game it is hard to really aquire anything outside of your starters without either grinding for gear and parts for hours and or just spending money i had put enough time to pretty much max my orignal tenno when i got banned for no reason all was said was i some how violated the eula when i have done nothing wrong in my knowledge i contacted support and said after manual review i did indeed do something to do such was not told what still and said ban could not be lifted glad i never wasted my money on this at this point i will not recommend anygame that bans players without a reasonable explination and violating the eula is not reasonable
not recommended
now this game is awesome but due to the fact its not server based but instead peertopeer it has extreme connection issues which makes it more frustrating to play then fun
not recommended
good in certain aspects like the combat but the controls are kinda crappy
not recommended
the gameplay was extremely linear the missions were buggy and to make it worse the storyline is literally just a whole concoction of player theories who have pieced together what they heard from enemies what we were told and lotus unless atleast the gameplay is fixed for me i dont recomend this game
not recommended
where to start with this one well first off i like the ghrapics the gameplay and the abilities however after a couple hours of playing i noticed that the enemies started doing way more damage and i was doing roughly the same as i started out so i decided to look for a new stronger weapon i find out that you cant buy a weapon thats better using the in game credits oh no you have to buy the currency using real money in order to get a decent weapon its that or you can do the facebook style of upgrading buy the blue print play a level a half dozen times to find a resource and then hopefully after a day of grinding you have what you need did i mention the fact you cant kill the enemies even on the first level anymore because their difficulty progressed with you >> so good luck getting those resources yet another potentially great game turned to  from greed i would have much rather paid 5060 bucks for the game and the ability to progress with ingame credits that i didnt have to buy versus having to buy 20 dollars worth of game money for a single weapon really as for those of you who fell victim to that and want to hold onto that pride so to speak of this being a great game it is sure but only for about 45 minutes

warframe seemed to be an interesting space adventure filled with combat and with a new patch it even includes ships im a simple sci fi guy and it was free so i bought it the game was terrible but the controls are probably the worst way to control a charcter i have ever seen e is melee attack while left and right click are to aim while f is to swap beetween your secondary and primary the tutorial if you can even call it that places you with all of your powers depending on which class you play warrior ranger mage but as soon as you leave the room you are left with only the first power you get as i played through the game and fought the generic humanish guys i felt extremly confused due to the starting senistivity being higher than snoop and using e to attack i eventually reached the selection of my first few secondary pistols i was told nothing about these guns so i never knew the difference same with the mele weapons as you can choose a stick guantlets or a sword when i eventually got to a wall running segment i died 10 times not because of my inability to press space but because my faceless avatar would kick off the wall or even better not be able to make a jump the hacking is horrendous think about it this way would you like a timed minigame about 15 sec where you cant go back once you move a puzzle peice unless you flip the peice all over again one that tells you nothing about how to do it and then will cut down the time when you get it halfway done the answer is no by the way did i like this game in short no in long n00000000000000000000 510kill it

i got a problem when i went to pruchase platinum fron the market with a 20% discount that i got from a log in reward so as i said i got the 20% discount and i went trough the process of payment and everything like ive done before but this time something happened that when i added funds to my steam wallet the game registered the purchase but it hasnt charged my bank account or my steam wallet and i havent got my platinum after the purchase i checked my steam wallet and it still shows that the money for the purchase is still there and on the history on my bank account it says that the transaction is peanding after a while when ive purchased platinum before i always receive it when i get back to the game but this time it did not happen and i really hope that this can be fixed because i look at the purchase platinum tab on the games market and it says that i have the discount but when i click on it the deals show that i dont have any discount so yeah im pretty much  that i have not received my platinum and lost the discount anyone that can help me with this ill appreciate it

worst visual experience ever mouse lags so bad motion blur makes me think im actually blind the first half an hour i didnt know how to play and i was looking at planets because the menus didnt appear until i reset my game really microtransaction based cannot upgrade anything even buy putting in the hours into the game if the currency for the game was cheaper id think about buying some points but its not worth it because everything that requires it is also overpriced

is the gameplay good i honestly have no idea i played the game a while ago and really enjoyed it i decided to get it on steam however when i did this there was a massive camera glitch in the missions the missionworld select screen worked perfectly however the cmera glitched out and i just saw a mesh of green colours i asked in the chat for help and it was full of unsociable and a trolly community i looked through a help section and again had no help maybe if this was sorted out i could have recommended the game but its simply buggy the new patches havent fixed the bug so i guess i just have to do something else until then

even with all unusual style and gameplay this game is terrible because it requires tons of your time to grind so you can get decent itemsmods and become a player who worth something my favorite weapons was nerfed new classes overpowered and old ones was nerfed hard this game was made to suck money because without donation you will waste many hours of trying to complete missions you want or get items you need with money in your pocket you can easily get everything and turn on easy mode ive played long time ago and it was decent there was of course one of the starting classes that could win everything in solo but the rest of them was useful now everything changed in a bad way i am very disappointed

my friends have been going on and on about this game for a little over a year now and so i thought id try it out no thanks its really dry maps feel cramped it just doesnt seem to move well to me if youre heavier into 3rd person shooters id say go for it but i feel like it was laggy and not worth the space on my hard drive
not recommended
great game lots of fun to bad it comes with to many bugs and crashes and these just take the fun out of the game fix these and i would recommend it but for now i wont
not recommended
its a simple 3rd person shooter that feels like youre playing by yourself even when you arent i got on and played a round alone and it was just lacking something but it was alright then i tried out the online game play and this is where i would take a few things into consideration before using up hard drive space the idea of the game after reading up is that every unit is individual and contributes to the larger team effort in a unique way great concept however it falls so flat that one might believe that it was tossed off the top of the empire state building it turns into a run and outgun frag fest where all you end up doing if trying to get the most kills and score the most loot while leaving everyone else behind the exp has nothing to do with team preformance or teamwork and instead only values the indiviual thus turning what could be a great teamwork experience into super mario party with guns
not recommended
do not buy this game its a great concept with good game mechanics but it is completely ruined by pay to play and more or less all of the interesting items you will never get because the grinding is stupidly tedious also you have this 4 revive a day system so you cannot even grind for long periods of time this game is great but yet another game ruined by micro transactions

personally not for me but for a free to play game i can see the appeal sci fi slashershooter

if you enjoy repetition grinding a complete lack of a story and boring gunplay to be fun id highly recommend warframe if not id stay away from this game the only good point that this game has going for itself is its rather unique aesthetics but thats about it
not recommended
avoid it is a pay to win
not recommended
game looks interesting and fun but that feeling wont last for too long missions and maps feel extremely repetitive enemies are as well and crafting is an absolute joke taking you days to craft a single thing and finding the materials for what you want will take you weeks sometimes months for very simple items its fun its fastpaced and its full of action though so if you can endure the extremely repetitive gameplay enemies and missions you might like warframe otherwise do stay away from this game

ive decided to rewrite a once good review on this game this is a good fun free game i want to make that known but since putting money into the game and spending my time in it ive been extremely disappointed since then my email is now said to not having a matching profile within the game my character is still there in my old clan but i cannot have access or log onto it the only way to use the websites support is through logging in which it will not allow me to do therefore theyve robbed me of my money and will no longer give me access to my old account something should be done immediately to compensate people whove experianced this such as i have as there is no reason this problem should have occured nor has it with me with any game ive ever played before what had been a good experiance has left me feeling completely robbed

this game has a verry basic tutorial that only teaches you how to swap wepons move and so on but the game has allot of features that it pretty much just throws at you like they are simple and easy to use but they arent also the game is more like a store than a game virtually all of the wepons and warframes will cost you real money

the premise of the game is a little odd and the plot is well dry boring and best ignored unless you like obscure and wierd space drama so moving on the game play has alot of innovative ideas poorly implemented so lets start with the big elephant in the room the free to play set up of the game is a pharce without spending real money on platinum or items you are at a huge disadvantage gear  experience and money come slow grinding not a little slow but insanely slow two weeks of playtime my gear is all around level 10 and everyone keeps telling me it gets better so why suffer through crappy game play to get to end game content that once again favors people who are willing to dump real money in the game ahh spend money yourself you say well heres my counter when you swing weapons they follow a static path much like an old style mortal kombat game meaning things like hills or rocks or a slight incline will cause your melee weapon to whiff secondly try wall running or duck jumping again confounded by terrair rocks poor control and slight inclines and finally the deal breaker  mission types certain missions like say the spy missions  wretched at best where one twitchy mob or missclick causes mission failure now throw into that ability missfires and buggy mobs are just part of the game im not talking about stuff that you can compensate with skill over im talking about the game randomly screwing you because of crappy code hmm i shot the dude on the alarm yet he triggered it after he died well balls or my favorite running an extermination mission and the wildlife attacks him and knocks him into terrain making it impossible for me to complete the mission and my final beef with the game is its revive system limited revives that you have to spend real money on to refresh or you fail on missions because youre out of revives when your randomly screwed over with a bug deal breaker this game should not be played by anyone unless this sort of half arsed game design is your niche

grind so you can get more equipment to grind in level design that rivals halo 1 in terms of most amount of copypasting its got better polish than your average f2p game the content is pretty expensive and also subjectively pay 2 win because path of exile or dota 2 could have done the same thing poe could have charged for uniques and dota for hero unlocks except they only charge for cosmetics path of exile is a coop pve game too in warframe you either cough up the cash or spend eternity grinding to grind some more its pretty much single player because theres no communication and most players tend to just hit the sprint  crouch button to reach the objective rather than collecting resources you are forced to chase them as they reach the only coop feature of the game where two players are need to hit a switch together to open a door here is a quick explaination of the gameplay you have an overview of our solar system you start at mercury each planet has a particular amount of missions before you proceed to the next planet planets also consist of resources which drop from killed enemies or cratesstorage in a nutshell you do coop missions which are bland grind items credit and resources purchase blueprints with the virtual credit each item requires certain resources for the sake of this review lets say i want to craft a rhino warframe it requires w x y z resources refer to the solar system map and see which planet has those resources now mercury will have z jupiter has y and pluto has w you will have to play missions even repeat them to aquire the neccessary resources once you do gather the resources you have to wait 1224 hours in real time for the foundry to craft the weapon this is nothing more than a way to nudge you reminding you that the game is free to play with inconvienience free to play really is a tainted model unless its path of exile and dota 2 and loadout where it actually works i rather cough up 2949$ to play a full experience all hostility aside the game has potential and digital extremes is a talented company considering they did ut1999 03 04 and dark sector the controls and graphics are fantastic get rid of the buy to unlock model and look at path of exiles as a blue print also for those who are complaining about wasting money on this game to only be dissapointed 2030 hours later its not the developers fault its the risk you take when you decide to invest in open betas and f2p give this game a try or try its prequel single player dark sector which was an underrated game by digital extreme

a bunch of my coworkers rave about this game to no end so i decided to hop on and try it good thing it is free to play or i would be asking for my money back though there is the option to play the game solo this is not a first person game this is an shooter mmo set in space if you want to play alone the game lets you but does not scale down the difficulty in one mission where i was supposed to prevent an artifact from being destroyed i found myself up against 30 baddies with lasers and grenades while all i had was a rifle and a pistol with no ammo needless to say i died alot and the game was ohso happy to keep track of just how often that was you are given a limited number of chances to revive the games fancy word for respawn but it does not have the decency other games have to moves you away from the mob of baddies that just killed you instead it drops you right in the middle of them only giving you control after it is done with the respawn animation but allowing the baddies to fill you with bullets as soon as the animation starts once your designated respawns have been used you cannot continue playing the game you can buy respawns however for platinum but that is currency you have to buy with real money you dont earn it the controls are a bit wonky moving the mouse moves the camera all the time and the direct your character is running about 45% of the time you only start with a rifle and a pistol though ammo for all the different weapon types drop from baddies and can be found in chests the baddies however can use what every type of weapon they want and have no problem shooting you when you are behind cover they also can stun lock you just by hitting you with the butt of their gun which leave you open to attacks that can take away all of your shield or half your health before you get a chance to run if you want more weapons you have to buy them with platinum and im not 100% certain you actually buy them i think you buy the designs to build them should you find the parts later on x is the defaut do the thing i need you to do button but the promt to do said thing either doesnt appear or appears in the smallest font the game can access i died several times because i was suppsed to access or hack or interface or something with a console and it would not let me until i stood exactly where it wanted me to stand and by then all the baddies had respawned and knocked me down to 2 hp there is also a foundry the games crafting system but you dont have any designs available to you at the start of the game that uses the materials you find in the starting missions you get mods that boost your health melee damage gun damage etc you for some reason you are only allowed to equip mods that have the same number as your level and once you do you cant equip one that when added to the values of your other mods is over your level for example you are allowed one free mod which is actually a power of your suit at level 3 i was allowed to equip a mod that increased my health by 40% at level 6 i thought i could instal another power mod so i could stop dying but i was stopped by an annoying little buzz sound as my level bar flashed the new power was for level 6 but if i wanted to use it i had to remove the level 3 mod and instal it by itself i could however install another level 3 mod but when i tried that i got buzzed again because it i could not have two mods of the same type ie two health mods active at the same time i know i am going to be told if you play with others then you wont have these problems why dont you play with others answer because i want to know what my character can do before jumping into a random matchup so as to try and avoid the ineffitable omg you are so bad at this stop playing youre ruining this for the rest of us you usually run into in mmos also if the game is meant to be an mmo i dont think they should give the player the option of playing solo because then you get players like me who think hey i can play abit by myself so when my friend come online to play i will be a better teammate becoming upset and writing bad reviews

for some initial boost in the game you can use this referral link httpswarframecomsignupreferrerid517f97771a4d809d7c000088  that will give you a 7day experience booster which will help you level up your warframe and gear faster this game is getting more and more grindy with each update and the sheer amount of grind will crush you i had high hopes for this game but with every update brings another layer of rng and grind and it just eats away all the motivation and enjoyment

game had potential but de is trying as hard as they can to get rid of it in favour of making a quick buck and bans anyone who calls them out on it cant say i blame them but it sure is a shame [grinding intensifies] ps warbros 1

i feel reluctant to give a yes or no recommendation for this game in fact i started writing this with a yes but eventually felt compelled to change it to a no the reason is that i love so much about the gameplay and the concept there is so much potential in the idea and existing framework it could be truly great but it has no reward to its rpgesque item grind it exists for its own sake if  like me  you actually dont mind laborious farming to reach a goal which in this case is always to purchase a new weapon or frame ie class then even the grinding for materials is not really a bad thing the real problem with warframe is that  when the combat gameplay is no longer sufficient as its own reward  the grind that is central & the only other motivation to play has absolutely no point as another review aptly described it is at its core a monotonous circular treadmill not just a treadmill a circular one in other treadmill games you at least clear hurdles during one jumping to the next treadmill so to speak  but this one is like a circular treadmill in that you are never anywhere different in terms of progression than the day you start sure you will accumulate a warchest of a crapload of weapons and modifications and classes  but you only ever use one of each in a mission so the more you accumulate the smaller % of what you earned you are using what good is having a thousand options of marginal variation for one thing you can accomplish that thing with just one option you dont need anything more but that is the only progression there is the missions are quite repetitive and quickly consumed content after which your only gameplay is to repeat the missions to acquire loot then use that loot to purchasecraft tools that you will just use to continue grinding loot the grind actually remains reasonable fun as you play around with cool weapons and powers but inevitably you hit the wall where you realize you are essentially just farming for the ability to farm some more  just with a shiny new weapon grind grind grind get a new weapon rinse repeat no competitive system no long term goals no real sense of accomplishment its a shame because the devs work quite hard and provide quite substantial updates on a rapid schedule yet refuse to break away from a business plan of simply adding more things to farm ive actually spoken at length with multiple devs of the game  who are very active in its community & open to feedback  vehemently voicing this concern  but for some reason it has never become a priority for them to create any new macro progression just more of the same i really hope one day this changes so i can return to the game i spent quite a bit of time playing and even quite a bit of cash as i dont mind rushing a few things i really want or supporting development but without a new purpose to playing i will not and continue to regret every penny spent

at first warframe appears to be something new and origional with its spectacular art style and graphics and its entire presentation is a feast for the eyes however after a few hours of gameplay grinding the same spots for the blueprients and materials to create the warframe or weapon you wanted you will wonder to yourself what now do you grind for more gear get some more fancy augments but whats the point when all your fancy warframes and weapons only make you more efficient at grinding for more stuff now i know what youre saying isnt that the basis of any mmo sort off if you boil it down any mmo is one big quest for loot but what makes it good is how fun it is to play all the dungeons and missions to recieve these rewards and warframe fails it it terribly this game becomes far too repetitive you only have a handful of scenarios to play through on missions and the difference between them is barely remarkable youre still fighting baddies through the same spaceship hallways just rearranged each time the warframes themselves are also fundamentally flawed each warframe has a unique set of abilities which three are avaliable from the start and the last only ebing avaliable when your wf is upgraded with an item that is conveniently found in the cash shop sure but you also have a rather limited pool of energy that you expend to use said abilities and said pool can only be replenished by scarce pickups so really yuor style is more defined by what wepaons you have painstakenly constructed by grinding for the materials to make and if you dont like them youre  out of luck not to mention the fact that there is little to no emphasis on teamwork on a multiplayer game i mean they try to do something by making each warframes abilities varied enough to try and do so but if youre not sprinting down a hallway and killing things fast then you end up being more of a burden t the team same thing applies to pvp nothing matters but outright damage and you better built the right warframe for it or its back to more grinding for you then there is the cash shop while every weapon and frame can be built from materials and blueprints dropped in missions which takes ages of grinding you can instantly buy them in the cash shop as well this screams play to win in the most blatant way but since grinding for your equipment is half the game youll probably come to the conclusion that this isnt worth the time faster if you spend a few bucks so despite its flashy looks and first impressions warframe is a huge dissapointment dont get me wrong i wanted this game to be good so badly its an absolute delight to look at and the setting alone is quite good how could you not enjoy what is essentialy a story revolving around an ancient race of alien space ninja but sadly the core gameplay mechanics fall short in what is a flawed game everything is so polished i can see someone forgetting that theyve been running through what is basically the same randomized space ship for hours to find the last few materials for their lazer katana that burns things that it slices through if only art direction could float a game on its own but i suppose if youre going to grind through the same spots for a while they might as well look pretty

i was enjoying the game it is hard to really aquire anything outside of your starters without either grinding for gear and parts for hours and or just spending money i had put enough time to pretty much max my orignal tenno when i got banned for no reason all was said was i some how violated the eula when i have done nothing wrong in my knowledge i contacted support and said after manual review i did indeed do something to do such was not told what still and said ban could not be lifted glad i never wasted my money on this at this point i will not recommend anygame that bans players without a reasonable explination and violating the eula is not reasonable

now this game is awesome but due to the fact its not server based but instead peertopeer it has extreme connection issues which makes it more frustrating to play then fun

even with all unusual style and gameplay this game is terrible because it requires tons of your time to grind so you can get decent itemsmods and become a player who worth something my favorite weapons was nerfed new classes overpowered and old ones was nerfed hard this game was made to suck money because without donation you will waste many hours of trying to complete missions you want or get items you need with money in your pocket you can easily get everything and turn on easy mode ive played long time ago and it was decent there was of course one of the starting classes that could win everything in solo but the rest of them was useful now everything changed in a bad way i am very disappointed
