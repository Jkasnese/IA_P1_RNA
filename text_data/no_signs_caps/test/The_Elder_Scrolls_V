it was good before but now we need to pay for mods i really dont like it what the gullible idiots who are in favor  or neutral  towards this toxic practice completely miss is that teleologically speaking there is a certain objectivity to what ends up being beneficial to everyone in the long run and what doesnt this objectivity of what is good and what is bad is correlated with ethics and that is what ensued this incurring torm the people who say that this practice is legitimate are the same who wont mind loads of dlc cutcontent ondisc dlc season passes microtransactions early access and the like please do notice that all the previous examples have one thing in common to detach you further away from your hardearned money in exchange for an ever lesser service paid mods will result in legal conundrums of epic proportions since most dlc infringes on various ip copyrights at the same time and with publishers meddling in a world previously untouched by corporate lawyers and legalese experts we the gamers in due time will see our mods reduce in quality variety and spectrum in due time modders will also be substituted from being enthusiastic fans who want to introduce new content to the games to being money hungry s from poor countries who want a quick buck selling tasteless reskins these new modders will  themselves out to corporate interests in exchange for a meager 25% yet again publishers win and we lose this new practice is completely outrageous no matter how one looks at it the idea of paid mods is also against the spirit of entrepreneurship voluntarism and capitalism it symbolizes the ascension of monetarism and the commoditization of every single aspect of content creation

money grubbing on a 4 year old game no thank you as many hours as i have enjoyed skyrim i can no longer play this game and enjoy myself seeing how far the platform and developer are willing to go to mees with the one thing that kept this game and so many other buggy games alive and still highly played well after their release cycle with the new paid mods so many efforts of the community which was fine with no help from the dev or platform have been  down the drain skyrim is filled with bugs and some areas even unplayable without the use of mods when a dev just leaves bug fixes to the community then trys to monetize that same communitys hard work for their own game 75% of the cut really is it just disgusting i will be moving all of my business to other websites and direct to the developers bethesda and valve you had a good run but i really detest unherhandded business practices and blatant betrayal of the community i will vote with my wallet until paid mods are fully removed ps that ama was so pandering and full of coporate double speak it wasnt even funny

this game honestly is barely passable stock tedious gameplay horrible ui bugs everywhere some quests outright broken etc with mods it can be a great game but that can be a risk as well since you will likely spend more time modding the game to make everything work together well and even then you may run into issues further along in your gameplay which mean youre screwed and that was fine for most until paid mods through workshop became a thing paid mods that have no qa no support and on top of that it looks like steam has disabled commentsreviews for the paid mods so you now have no way of knowing which mods are actually good which may break your game irreversibly is possible which mods suck which are copyright infringements etc bethesda has long relied on the modding community to fix their games and now that they make the lions share of the profits from the mods they have no incentive to improve their games which means i will likely not be buying anymore bethesda games too bad i dont mind spending hours getting all my mods working together working with tes5edit wryebash mod manager screwing with load lists install orders but paying for the privilege of doing all that i dont think so if im going to pay for mods they need to just work just like dlc does

after a very long time of playing skyrim i have decided my verdict although it took a long time to come to terms with my selfdeception i believe i can finally give the elder scrolls v skyrim an unbiased review the gameplay of skyrim is largely based on the actionrpg genre similar to the previous installment oblivion but different from morrowind you can choose to see the world through either the third or first person through that decision you use weapons that you can upgrade but also grow in strength through your characters skill level that is increased by your continued use of the type of weapon to kill everything considered hostile without a seconds thought item and gold management is largely useless at higher difficulties and is fairly pointless at lower ones as well potions can be spammed in combat by pausing the game world to access your inventory gold buys nothing you cant loot from the corpses you laid out on your journey towards wherever you happened to be going at that time using the smith skill you can get all the best items for your level exactly when they are available and most times before even that dungeons are just a sequence of rooms with enemies in them that you have to kill to get to the end after that you just take a conveniently stupid shortcut right back to the entrance there is generally nothing unique about any of them just a single track to follow from the entrance to the end like something out of wow you can become the guild leader of all the guilds in a single playthrough after just a single questline each most of the quests are so boring and uninteresting that they just stay in your quest journal for the rest of time because you cant be bothered to complete them the ones that are interesting are over in a half hour to an hour the writing is stunted by lack of imagination the world is horribly vanilla for a tes game less so than oblivion thankfully populated with generic vikings romans and evil nazis the main questline can be largely abandoned for the more interesting sidequests and often is and the implementations of dragons and dragon shouts becomes boring after killing a hundred or so the skills system is also uninspired i imagine it started with the idea that your skills improve the more you use them this is true to an extent however the fact that they still incorporated a leveling system along side the usebased skills becomes frustrating they blended their new system with the old one and it becomes counterintuitive leveling up you are given the choice of upgrading your health magica or stamina and you are given one point to put into whatever skill you choose while the original stats system may be hard to grasp by newcomers to the series the continued casualization of the series just feels like a betrayal to the crowd that helped build it all of the things i have mentioned are all symptoms of bethedsa reaching out to a wider audience just like they did with oblivion i do not agree with this practice this is not to say skyrim is a bad game just not the game it could have been

skyrim is a good game no doubt about it and the various mods that have been made for close to 4 years now are a testimony of that  modding is about sharing and bulding a strong community  its about passion for gaming  hiding mods behind a paywall will divide us  these types of practice are unforgivable and trying to bleed people dry will only justify pirating valve and bethesda have open the pandora box and skyrim is the first nail in the coffin of pc gaming

changing my review of the game to negative i am not against the idea of supporting modders for their efforts but the newly introduced system on the workshop is deeply flawed eg using other modders resources and charging for them stealing content and outragous prices base game for 5 starter pack of mods for 26and taking a 75% cut between bethesda and valve for work they didnt do themselves i recommend everyone to go to the nexus and support content you like through their donation system
not recommended
a gorgeous open world game steeped in its own mythology with sharp tactile melee combat and satisfying archery ive never got on with magic in elder scrolls games but thats purely personal preference both the graphics and art design are great making simply wandering around immersive you can ignore the main questline if you wish  its a soso you are the chosen one save us all fantasy affair  which is not a problem as there is so much else to do personally i tend towards wandering and enjoying the harsh wintry vistas that seem to be around every other corner occasionally stumbling into a longforgotten dungeon to explore and loot when the novelty wears off and you start to see through the smoke and mirrors simplistic npcs and ai small and underpopulated towns and villages theres a multiplicity of mods for the game that do everything from expanding and populating the land creating more realistic weather improving textures adding quests and characters often fully voiced well you see the point its an elder scrolls game and its the mods that are the big draw for a lot of players and heres the rub im not against donating to modders  these folk put their heart and soul into making games different better more varied even fixing bugs but the payment model being tested on skyrim by valve and bethesda is both grossly unfair to the modders who receive only a 25% cut with the rest being pure profit for the companies and has already led to some horribly perverse outcomes with one paid mod taken down already for using others assets without permission and dmca claims against another numerous mods have vanished from the nexus website as modders pull their work for fear it will be stolen meanwhile its very likely that the mod store will fill with dross put out to make a quick buck and it is very unclear exactly what and with whom we as consumers are transacting and hence what our rights are what happens if a mod works as intended but is abandoned much like greenlight the community is not going to be able to effectively police quality  the flood of rubbish into the steam store recently is testament to this now it seems likely that modding currently a wonderful and integral part of pc gaming is going the same way for the sake of a quick buck theres better ways to do this so why cant modders players devs and valve work it out rather than have yet another illthoughtthrough scheme forced on us

this game is near perfect if you wish to ignore the paidmod issue however i like many passionate gamers disagree with introduction of paid mods what if free mods become adinfested spyware like mobile apps tend to be what if publisher decides to ban free mods in favor of paid mods what if a mod you buy continually crashes your game what if a mod you buy is incompatible with another paid or free mod what if a paid mod developer decides to abandon a mod leaving you with an incompatible broken mess too many what ifs to ignore

this game has been kept alive with mods these mods are the only reason i still play hiding mods behind a paywall is a horrible idea the amount of money people would have to spend and sometimes waste only to have things not work its not worth it mods are part of the community not the market i guess they are now one in the same

it is a decent game still not nearly as good as morrowind you can check out my review for that if youre interested in my thoughts on it at best without mods its a blandlooking bugridden clickspam combat hack and slash game the story is mediocre and the dumbing down of the series shows if you get it cheap $5$15 with all the dlc then yeah its worth it i however bought it at launch which i sorely regret doing however with mods the game is certainly much better from graphics to gamepay its just all around better but i am not reviewing skyrim modded im reviewing vanilla skyrim so ill have to stick to my negative review
not recommended
around the time i graduated high school i found this great game called morrowind the story was engrossing the world immersive  and as i soon came to discover the game was heavily moddable this meant that even though i had already played through a good portion of this game and was soon to finish i could replay it and have a very different experience and i did so much i even created my own underground lair with the editor it was amazing needless to say mods and the modding community really set the scene for bethesdas tes series and has been a major driver behind its wild popularity fast forward to skyrim i no longer have the time to sink into creating my own material these days but i still run a little over 100 mods these mods breathe a life into the game well beyond its vanilla experience such that ive sunk over 600 hours into play time would i have done this if all of these mods cost me a couple dollars each would i be so smitten with the series still even after all these years hell no like most folks out there i am not made of money i live on a budget i am not going to pay two hundred three hundred four hundred dollars for a video game i will donate to the community when i can  a community that has done very well for itself without this hairbrained forced mods4cash scheme so far mind you  and i appreciate all the time and effort the modders have put into their work bethesdavalve dont really seem to appreciate this effort quite so much with their 75% cut off the back of folks who are breathing life into their games and keeping sales going for far longer than they would have if the games were locked to modders in light of recent events and the hollow words of gabe newell on his reddit ama which seem to point to a continued mods fer sale on steam existence  i would not recommend skyrim or the elder scrolls series going forward

its a good game but the new practice of selling mods is being handled without any form of consideration for the consumer and as such i feel the overall quality of the game is going to suffer for this think about these mods in terms of quality forget about the fact theyve been made by an outside entity youre essentially paying for early access dlc that might not even be compatible with other early access dlc theres no form of quality assurance whatsoever valve have a no refund policy and im not even sure what the legality of the situation is in regards to esrb ratings if you want to buy the game or any of the official dlc go ahead but stay away from the modding content with a price tag until theres some form of quality assurance

i have enjoyed skyrim for more than 400 hours no thanks to bethesda and their bugriddled pile of crap but thanks to the dedicated modders that polished the turd until it was a gem enough is enough i am not against modders earning a bit of cash for their work but this implementation is insulting beyond reason the entire reason that skyrim is still one of the most popular games in the world is because of the modders yet they only receive 25% off their work the announcement and the secrecy up untill then the lack of information discussion and the outright banning of dissenting voices in steam discussions speaks volumes of how much bethesda and valve value us a customers all the goodwill bethesda had built with me by being one of the only aaa developers to offer extensive modding support has vanished and i will not buy fo4 the next dishonoured or other bethesda games gabens insulting ama on reddit where he did everything he could to do damagecontrol by the corporate  book in the past i have supported steam by usually buying my games so far more than 200 through this service ven if alternatives existed but no more i have already bought witcher iii on gog instead as a protest and in the future i will never buy anything directly from steam again it will be nuuvem humblebundle or gog when available a stand against corporate greed and for the good of the modding community needs to be taken and thus i cant recommend skyrim at this time

the vanilla unmodded game of skyrim at its core is mediocre at best the mods and the modding community have made this game what it is so many years after release the entire paytouse mod structure has ruined the game and the wonderful modding communities that had once collaborated without money in mind getting this game now is a mistake you will regret it you will end up paying dozens times more for mods than the game itself costs dont support this horrendous greedy system and dont buy this game
not recommended
this game is near perfect if you wish to ignore the paidmod issue however i like many passionate gamers disagree with introduction of paid mods what if free mods become adinfested spyware like mobile apps tend to be what if publisher decides to ban free mods in favor of paid mods what if a mod you buy continually crashes your game what if a mod you buy is incompatible with another paid or free mod what if a paid mod developer decides to abandon a mod leaving you with an incompatible broken mess too many what ifs to ignore

this game has been kept alive with mods these mods are the only reason i still play hiding mods behind a paywall is a horrible idea the amount of money people would have to spend and sometimes waste only to have things not work its not worth it mods are part of the community not the market i guess they are now one in the same

nice basic game but the many different mods really make it shine now that bethesta is trying to monetize the work of the modders while only paying them 25% i dont think future players can have the same enjoyment playing that i had

the game itself is a masterpiece the mods make the game 100x better why am i not recommending the game valve and bethesdas pay for mods program what a load of utter  valve bethesda get rid of this  asap and replace with a donate button similar to what we have on the nexus do this and ill change my recommendation to yes
not recommended
i still do not understand what good paid mods could bring to games like this these games have always had a dedicated modding community that have pretty much made the game as popular and enjoyable as it is today within hours of its implementation it has pretty much split the modding community angered thousands of valve and tes fans and caused major damage to the modding community i will not support paid mods i dont want the modding community filled with loving highly respectable creators to be turned into another cash cow just like games did once dlc started getting abused

this game is unplayable without mods bethesda never bug checks or fixes any of their software imagine paying $5 for vanilla skyrim then $6 for a magic fix package a la midas magic dont take your chances you are not purchasing a game you are pruchasing a modding expansion base if the mods are behind a paywall you can easily pay hundreds of dollars just to bring the game up the standards it set with a fully modded installation

downloaded this game and was dissapointed at the very beginning when the guys in the wagon with me were talikng to me but no sound came from their mouths then when we got to the execution point nothing happened it just stopped and they were just staring doing nothing waited 15 minutes and nothing happened noticed that the horses were still moving even though into a wall and the driver was still wipping the horses so i installed earlier version of direct x same problem

modders should make a lot more than 25% for their own creation but the fact steam is forcing people to pay money to use their system when you can find the same mods free elsewhere

paid mods no just no i am deeply disappointed in bethesda about this skyrim and the fallout series is one of my favorite games and when i saw they introduce this just no i think there should only be one option and that is pay what you want aka a donation

the vanilla story of skyrim is basic at best the openworld was good for its time but hasnt aged well its a fun game to play once that is if you dont mod the game mods are an essential part of what makes the elder scroll series good now that valve and bethesda have effectively killed the modding community i would not recommend this game maybe pirate it
not recommended
first id like to point out that the game itself is fantastic and it is through the multitude of mods that make it so damn amazing now that steam is supporting paid mods more and more content is and will be put behind pay walls welcome to the new era of dlc dlc that the company itself doesnt have to make i do not support steams idea of paid mods the workshops will be flooded with absolute crap mods that took little time to make in an effort to make a quick buck i highly doubt anyone who plays this game doesnt have a long list of mods they run many running over fifty mods now imagine having to pay for all the mods you use basically doubling the cost of the game or more hopefully the majority of mod makers do not jump on this bandwagon and can see that steam is just trying to use them to make more money because of this decision i have changed my review to negative and i hope both steam and bethesda sees the folly of their decision edit apparently the split is only 25% for the actual modders so they do the work and only get 14th of the earnings shows exactly what valves intentions are money

do not buy this game you will support valves and bethesdas terrible new mod policies in case you have been living under a rock bethesda and valve have introduced paid mods for skyrim this is not only problematic because this was a service previously free but because it is a system that can be easily exploited which is what is happening on top of that the modder himself only gets a small cut of the profits if a mod gets sold valvebethesda get around 75% of the revenue made off of said mod which is absolutely inexcusable do not support this  business

bethesda and valve are steering pc gaming down the wrong path by implementing monetized modding and theyre using skyrim as a spearhead as such i cannot recommend this game to newcomers despite my love for it at this stage of skyrims life modding is whats keeping it alive for the vast majority that play it including myself to put mods behind a paywall is opening up a huge can of worms that can only be detrimental to the future of the platform and must be stopped before it advances too far for further reading refer the forbes article on the most important points  httpwwwforbescomsitesinsertcoin20150424valvespaidskyrimmodsarealegalethicalandcreativedisaster

first off let me start by saying this is a fantastic game and has been potentially ruined by recent events now i do think that mod developers should be able to receive money for their work i don think it should have been handled in the way it has why not simply add a donate button and valve take a 1015% cut for doing all the hosting etc and then give the original dev around 10% which would leave the mod creator around 75% of the money for 100% of the work 2 weeks ago this review would have been positive but now well see for yourself

the quality of the tes franchise has always been iffy whether it be the poor combat of morrowind dodgey iron sights in nv or the shockingly bad ui in skyrim but at the same time free mods have always been around to fix up bethesdas bad ideas and shameful lack of quality control however now that valve and bethesda are pushing to monetise the modding community with paid mods it becomes difficult to recommend skryim to anyone knowing that at some point in the future the ability to fix bethesdas numerous gameplay misteps and bugs might become what is effectively quite expensive thirdparty dlc moreover paid modding is genuinely offensive in many ways given that bethesda and valve are taking 75% of mod revenue for essentially not only failing to make a good game but taking away one of the key selling points of the pc version of this game after the fact i would in no way recommend this game nor future games in the tes franchise

wow i dont believe it not only has zenimax figured out a way to be even more lazy and ignorant in making a videogame but also wants to ruin everyone elses fun by selling something that has always been considered free and from the heart i understand that the videogame press has decided to defend this choice simply put a paywall for mods but when have they ever been right i mean lets apply this to reality we know that modders can code better than any bethesda employee see bug fixes and skyrim script extender but what if bethesda was an automobile dealer ask yourself this question before you even consider purchasing this game or any mods should you ever have to pay to have a factory defect fixed on a car if you answered yes please consider celibacy and renounce civilization youre better off swinging from the trees

whilst the game gives a solid platform and the core story is reasonably good the real meat of the game comes from the extensive modding community whilst this has always been a huge selling point for pc gaming valve and bethesda are currently attempting to turn this wonderful aspect of pc gaming into something they can exploit the community with for $$$ the idea of paying mod makers isnt a problem and should be encouraged the fact is that the following a there is no quality assurance the mod can be utter rubbish yet until you fork out $$$ you cant know b the mod makers only get 25% of the profit yup the person who did 100% of the work gets a tiny fraction of the money c if a mod stops working tough luck d the mod must earn $400 before the creator sees a penny if it only earns $399 then valve & bethesda get the lot e this encourages both big and impressibe mods but also cash grab nonsense all in all do not support this company

was a great game singlehandedly ruined with the introduction of legally questionable paywalls for fanmade mods many modders have pulled their works from public as others began to steal them to turn a profit on steam and most of the money made from it goes to bethesdasteam rather than the creator themselves a shameless and blatant display of greed that is beginning to tear apart the modding community and pushing away people who genuinely liked and wanted to make this game more fun

first i want to say i own skyrim for the xbox with over 180 hours played and think its a fantastic game even as a standalone ive always wanted to have the pc version of skyrim to play some of the mods ive seen for it well thanks to valve and bethesda i cant enjoy the modded skyrim experience without being sure to give them even more money i think its absolutely crazy that bethesda has made over a billion dollars on skyrim yet they want to take 75% of every paid mod offered in the steam workshop same goes for you valve im sure youve made a lot of money off skyrim and its disgusting how greedy the both of you are being you both are multi billion dollar companies but lets take some more of our communities money by doing 0 work and making 75% of the profits you remind me of congress soon as the question of pay raises for themselves is brought to the table its the fastest thing congress passes next to mexican food i will buy this game i played the trial as soon as modding returns to what it was instead of another funnel directly into valvebethesdas greedy overflowing pockets
not recommended
the game itself was great with mods was awesome but now that valve and bathesda decided to turn mods into paid dlc is damaging not only the community but also the re playability of newer games and the possible abuse from modders for a quick cash grab mods have gave birth to countless classics and it is my opinion thanks to a loyal and passionate community creating paywalls will hinder that innovations and divide the community why not add a donation button instead
not recommended
paid mods that dont even support the mod makers because they only get 25% of all sales is a deal breaker for me
not recommended
do not buy this game on steam as long as they are making people pay for mods mods are not commercial products if they want people to give money they should have implemented a donate button
not recommended
only 25% of the game was good

love this game to death but what valve and bethesda are doing to it is just wrong mods should not become dlc and that is exactly what is happening here the community needs to put its foot down and show them that we do not support the direction they are taking our games

have you played previous elder scrolls games this is just them except with nicer graphics and some systems which are either a little better or a lot worse only worth it with mods which are a huge ordeal to install and even then the combat is not good

 the exploration was good  some good mods but cannot really rate a game on what other people make for it but hey got to have more than one positive up here  rather uninteresting story and rather dull combat  almost all the side quests were bad now that they are starting to be paywalled it is hard to justify getting this game the extra conent which was paid to begin with was not worth the hassel hearthfire does add in something interesting which i have not seen in rpg other than rs and without having to spend weeks building a decent house was something to be happy with while this pay for extra things in our lackluster game because we spent too much time drawing and not enough time writing game was good with mods it does not justify spending extra just to have it tweaked to your preference reccommendation for a game which is very good with mods  mount and blade warband rpg with good medival period fantasy combat  dark souls 12 rpg with good story  oblivion had some very good moments mass effect trilogy bit wonky at times due to a writer leading at some point

these new ways to support workshop creators are a joke especially with the measly 25% cut with no quality control the desire to make $$$ will be what drives modders to flood the workshop with loweffort paid mods and they can already be found in the workshop mods have always been something pc gamers have been able to brag about theyve always been freely available to us and theyre very useful when it comes to fixing broken games heck there are skyrim mods that fix bugs and issues that only make the game much better theres an old way that actually supports content creators that isnt anything new and really does support the creator donations  you could just implement that but of course steam knows that they defend their cut by saying that modders have a pay what you want option that does absolutely nothing to alleviate the meager cut modders get and seriously no announcements for feedback on this new feature as unexpected as it was we know why it happened and steamvalve know why they couldnt let anyone know i hope the backlash shows steamvalve that while pc gamers have always put them on a pedestal for good reason the pedestal can always be kicked out under them

would pay for mods again 1010 on a serious note though this game is ok buy on sale otherwise dont oh and dont buy any workshop mods even if you want to support the modders they only get 25% of your payment and they dont get paid any cent if they dont make 400 usd at the end of the month which excludes the huge cut valve bethesda and some other people including the nexus get 75% overall now lets think about that a little imagine if i made a little mod and would sell it for 1$ i only get 25 cents of every sale now for those 25 cents to add up to 400$ 1600 people would have to buy my mod even if you wish to support modders directly donating to them via paypalpatreonwhateverthepeopleusetogetdonations will help them a lot more consider doing that if you insist on giving modders a little tip in my opinion mods should not be locked behind a paywall if you support this standpoint too write a negative review in the same vein as mine and vote with your wallet after all valve are a company that knows how to handle money and if nobody buys these mods being locked behind a paywall and if enough people speak up against it we might be able to have them stop this new practice if people will support this on the other hand mods will become glorified dlc and a lot of modders will be opportunists jumping on the train for a quick buck
not recommended
you know ive played this game quite a bit the only reason i have the low play data is due to a steam reset i believe skyrim is an amazing game with limitless potential due to the power of modding but now valve and bethesda have moved to try and put those mods behind a paywall i cant reccomend a game that does that

skyrim without mods is a bland boring game skyrim on pc without a $5 ui mod is considered unplayable by many people so the price of this game is always at least $5 more than they say dont pay for mods dont let bethesda sell you dlc they didnt create

as an almost fouryear terraria modder i just cannot support this practice to spread paid mods are one of the steps that will degrade the quality of games to a large degree and any game that has done this in the past is now dead or nearly dead combined with the dlc practices practiced by many companies this just isnt good news and hereby i do not support this practice a donate button would be fine but not locking mods behind greed what valve makes a huge profit off of just screams money and greed to me and it should to everyone who sees this practice

now that steam and gaben have sold out and opened a pandoras box shaped like a terrible idea i can no longer recommend skyrim prior to this ive logged 70h on my steam copy of skyrim 150h on xbox 360 and 40h on a nonsteam copy i never downloaded mods from the workshop to begin with because it was already inferior to other options now those other options have the added benefit of not being paygated but this stupidity has already made people start pulling their mods from free sites for fear of having them stolen uploaded to the workshop and their own work dmcad the game itself is solid and the modding community made it excellent but i fear that that may be over now i have never been more ashamed of valve and bethesda than i am now httpswwwchangeorgpvalveremovethepaidcontentofthesteamworkshop  56k signatures and counting e as of 42715 valve and bethesda relented and took down paid mods for skyrim however but we underestimated the differences between our previously successful revenue sharing models and the addition of paid mods to skyrims workshop we understand our own games communities pretty well but stepping into an established years old modding community in skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating we think this made us miss the mark pretty badly even though we believe theres a useful feature somewhere here this review will remain negative until three years have passed with no attempt to institute the same system for other newer games without a community ready to defend them
not recommended
very dissapointed in bethesda and steam allowing for paid mods the skyrim modding community has been fine and continued to steer in the right direction for well over 9 years including tesoblivion the last thing we need is for steam and bethesda to make a quick buck also according to gabe newell on the reddit ama the percentage split for paid mods is dictated by the developer if bethesda really believed in supporting mod creators the cut % would not be just 25% overall developers are looking to make a quick buck and not here to support the modding community i am very dissapointed

i cant in good faith recommend this anymore bethesda and valve trying to monetize a hallmark of pc gaming mods have a long successful history and its never been about getting rich mods are made users enjoy donations are made and often times mods get picked up by game companies now and again and are made into amazing games of their own nothing about this new system incites creativity and quality i know they wont listen to a simple review but i hope our chance to vote with our dollars doesnt come before this spreads

if there is any game that proves studios do not need to release a relatively bug free massive content filled game while still being overwhelmingly successful tesv skyrim is it however bethesda owes their success and high ratings to the kind and good willed people who fixed  modified skyrim for nothing in return and what does bethesda do to reward these people they endorse a laughable cash farmpaid mods system where they are doing nothing and taking the biggest cut the only reason why this 4 year old game is still relevant and talked about today is because of the content modders created and fixed yes paid mod system on steam workshop has been removed but bethesda has left a burning scar on the attractive modding community with their actions i have no doubt they would try and take advantage of their greatest undeserved asset again which is why i cant thumbs up this product what i think of the game itself without mods good  graphicsvisuals are good for its time i like the combat talent tree is nice sprint bar bad  short quest lines especially for guilds dialoguestory writing doesnt live up to previous elder scrolls dragon combat seems corny to me not as many cavesdungeons as tesiv about the whole paid mods situation im not against someone making money for the things they create ^ive bought several early access games this isnt even necessary to say^ im not against giving my money to someone for the things they create i have donated money to modderserver owners in the past i am against steam workshop turning into a micro transaction nightmare i am against studios making money on mods that fix a game i am against studios having even less incentive than they do now to make an outstanding game because they would be able to sit on a cash farm known as paid mods

im in two minds whether to change this review back to positive or not because im still neutral here thing is skyrim is only an amazing game because of the many thousands of mods that prop it up take the mods away and youre left with a simple fps rpg game with an even simpler plot it looks wonderful it plays rather smoothly the combat is nice there are other things you can praise skyrim for but the sheer power and tenacity of modders is what makes skyrim so strong thankfully the skyrim paid mod workshop fiasco has come to an end but my trust has been shaken for now i will leave my review as negative a fitting scar for the scism that now runs down the community on an unrelated note dont buy the dlcs on their own its often cheaper to just get the ultimate edition whenever its on sale for 10 or so  you save yourself a good bit of money

let me break this down to you when skyrim came out almost four years ago it was a buggy awful mess stuttering everywhere npcs breaking down and if you went in the wrong place at the wrong time it crashed today it is still a buggy awful mess stuttering everywhere npcs breaking down and if you go through the wrong door at the wrong time it will crash but luckily there were mods to fix that stuttering removal scriptfixes for the npcs and magic ritual powered by the blood of children to stop this thing from crashing every time you go in a building now mods are behind a paywall now you have to pay for the very things that made this game playable in the first place on top of the games actual price its a scam theres literally no other word for it except for synonyms for scam you are now being treated exactly like the little consumer plaything bethesda and valve see you as and not a lot of people like it i definitely dont so i cannot in good consciousness recommend you a buggy awful mess where you have to pay extra for communitymade addons for the same reason i cannot recommend you a crappy free to play mmo where you have to pay for an edge over every other player dont buy this game

ok so id like to point out that this game is amazing the storyline the quests and sidequests the land available even without any dlc will have you hooked for hours then the dlc come which are exceedingly good and worth every penny then it comes to the bad mods well paid mods the mods themselves are amazing getting chased by the trololol troll while riding flutter from my little pony is something that never gets old however paying 5 for a mod on a 7 game is an absolute joke there are many other ways around this which im not allowed to nexus ahem talk about if you dont own this get it but do not for the love of god pay for any mods the devs have always done ths out of the kindness of their heart and have always said you can donate to them great game 1010 would take an arrow to the kneww for whereas screw paid mods

negative review in support of the removal of the paid mods system
not recommended
valve and bethesda decided to profit off of the modding community destroying it in the process
not recommended
not supporting steam or bethesda until they completely change their business models i can certainly survive without slyrim as oblivion morrowind and new vegas are better games with free mods any way i recommend that you who are reading this review do the same and shop only at gog humble bundle and dare i say it eas origin valve needs more competition now edit 4272015 1003 pm welp they finally did a 180 degree reversal with the policy for skyrim but in the official press release for this policy change the official valve employe who annouced this change implied that they would try again just not for skyrim so no im still not supporting valve anymore they are still a monopoly they are still hypocrites but what now for skyrim and bethesda should i now give skyrim a positive review no its my opinion that zenimax and bethesda softworks not beth game studio still want some form of paid modding and were the main pushers for paid modding in the first place remember horse armor also i have my beefs with skyrim itself as a game people really should play morrowind oblivion and new vegas before spending hundreds of hours into this shallow game i cant go into specifics at the moment but there are plenty of reviews and videos online addressing concerns that i agree with view valves statement here httpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracecomments3434itpaid_mods_in_the_steam_workshop 4282015 bethesda gave their own pr twitst httpwwwbethblogcom20150427whyweretryingpaidskyrimmodsonsteam look at this particular statement horse armor gave us a start into something new and it led to us giving better and better value to our players with dlc like shivering isles point lookout dragonborn and more they seriously believe that horse armor has helped not just oblivion elder scrolls and fallout but also the gaming industry as a whole horse armor did not encourage them to make epansion packs and dlc that were planned and were in development already if they could without backlash they would follow the scamlike behaviors of other developers like ea or paradox when it comes to the most inane dlcs they said to the effect well mod sales were insignificant anyway and people who use mods and make mods are very insignificant when comparing to all skyrim players well if it wasnt that significant why risk your business and lose potential customers for future games you idiots they also said that they began discussions and planning for paid mods back in 2012 they will not simply waste 3 years of planning because of this backlash no business plans something for such a long time just to do a complete 180 and waste all the wages to people who worked on introducing a new product or service and all the data and knowledge from analyzing the market this will come back one way or another my positive review for skyrim will not
not recommended
first there had been the expansion packs and there were dlcs and now there are mods for sale  you valve make hl3 already
not recommended
what can i say halffinished game that only survived because of modability which will now be placed behind payment walls while the decision is a good one for modding in the long term the consumer is again shafted i wouldnt recommend the base game skyrim as anything close to being worth playing however if you dont mind to keep forking out money for characters weapons minor patches etc then this game might be for you was nice while it lasted though edit well now that the paid mods have been >>temporarily<< put on hold until they can put more legal bindings on them i will refrain from changing the review since its only a matter of time before its back also the damage has been done the community is in shambles modders are leaving and players are still spamming about it i feel like the modders pulling their free mods is mostly because of the players who attacked the modders more than the allure of potential profits the playerbase attacked the wrong targets here but everythings been done now we just wait and see where this develops thirdparty dlc that the company is actually getting money for and then money from publishing it is here to stay there is nothing we can do ill miss gaming
not recommended
paid mods dont buy this game
not recommended
edit even though valve & bethesda withdrew paid mods from skyrim i am still not changing my review them pulling it back doesnt change that they tried to push the idea in the first place the game itself is great many hours of fun in just the base game add mods and it becomes a whole new experience why the negative review you may ask mods are the lifeblood of this game and valve & bethesda see fit to lock them behind paywalls just to make a quick buck this is not acceptable
not recommended
paidmods you wouldnt steal a car but you would pirate a mod
not recommended
first id like to point out that the game itself is fantastic and it is through the multitude of mods that make it so damn amazing now that steam is supporting paid mods more and more content is and will be put behind pay walls welcome to the new era of dlc dlc that the company itself doesnt have to make i do not support steams idea of paid mods the workshops will be flooded with absolute crap mods that took little time to make in an effort to make a quick buck i highly doubt anyone who plays this game doesnt have a long list of mods they run many running over fifty mods now imagine having to pay for all the mods you use basically doubling the cost of the game or more hopefully the majority of mod makers do not jump on this bandwagon and can see that steam is just trying to use them to make more money because of this decision i have changed my review to negative and i hope both steam and bethesda sees the folly of their decision edit apparently the split is only 25% for the actual modders so they do the work and only get 14th of the earnings shows exactly what valves intentions are money
not recommended
the skyrim workshop had always been a great place for discovering communitymade mods starting now the workshop is also a great place for community content creators to get bent over and sodomized by selling their greatest works and only getting 25% check out the latest creations here

microtransactions dlc pay4mods no thanks

paid mods the future is so bright i dont need my eyes too see it
not recommended
first game to introduce dlc contents and steal from content creators i would not recommenc this game
not recommended
due to steams practices of selling mods other than creating a button for donating i must give this a negative review in protest
not recommended
paid mods wow just wow who in the world thought that was a good idea add a donate option as apposed to selling the mod and taking all the profit the only reason i bought this game on the computer is so that i could mod the living crap out of it shame on you valve and bethesda
not recommended
avoid like the plague this is now a dlc simulator hiding behind the mask of a way to help content creators when they barely get any of the profit
not recommended
less content than either morrowind or oblivion you used to be able to increase content with mods but now theyve nickled and dimed that away
not recommended
used to be good until are you forced to pay for other peoples mods they even started banning people on the forums and started forcing mod sites to pull the mods so steam can make a profit
not recommended
i am never giving a single penny to valve or bethesda again congrats on ruining modding for everyone
not recommended
hey valveim ex ea employe and i have good business model for you as well as letting your costumers pay 499$ for a sword textureyou might be interesting to let them pay 199$sale from 399$ for casting a fireball ingameor getting horse ingame for 799$that was in another tes mmo titlesorry im from eawe dont really original hereim giving you that ideasbut if u gonna actually use it in futureid like to charge 75% from your potential profits seriously  paid mods 010

hahaha oh boy valve bethesda you guys ed up bad with this one games great free mods are fun but the payformods thing is super gay  that  man helps nobody but bethesda suck up more money for doing jack 
not recommended
they want you to pay for features made by amateurs that should have been in the game to begin with
not recommended
doesnt deserve all of the praise an overhyped oversimplified rpg with frustrating combat overwhelming and unnecessarily complex skill trees and braindead ai the only justification for buying this game is for modding which is the only thing that makes this game half bearable as the vanilla version is completely bland use your money somewhere else
not recommended
remove paid mods greedy valve
not recommended
good dammit valve this greed for money is insane put a damn support modder button in not turn mods into dlc put good use to your time and instead of screwing up one of the best games of all time jesus edit i am keeping my review up only because valve and bethesda were being stupid and you dont reward somone for being stupid though i do like them just that was a low moment
not recommended
they want you to pay for features made by amateurs that should have been in the game to begin with
not recommended
i loved the game and the release but the prototyping of mods for sale is just an extension of dlcs that happens to poison the intelectual property of a great game dispite the obvious legal issues and community backlash bethesda and valve have decided to go with the option that nets the most money in the short term by spending their community trust
not recommended
so many things to do endless activities and endless amount of mods to install and play around with very well optimized and is one of the best games of all time my play history doesnt show it all but i played a bunch of it on the ps3 before i switched to pc master race 1010 ign 3
recommended
super awesome game best i have played on pc yet
recommended
with the mods like frostfall and the various vampire tweaks this is the corner stone of rpg single player games my only regret is that it is not a multiplayer experience cheers bethesda
recommended
id highly recommend this game to anybody whos a fan of fantasythemed games and rpg this game has made its mark as probably one of my favourite games every second of this game is zmazingly fun right from the tutorial to the defeat of the antagonist the game has hours of gameplay from the main story as well as countless more with the addition of doing whatever you want the true beauty of this game though is you can play it how you want whether you prefer earning your wealth from acts of kindness or stealing it from the shadows you can without breaking the game whether you prefer playing as the peoples hero the assassin of the shadows or the greatest mage in all of tamriel you can do so this game truely takes the open world genre and breaks it wide open pun intended the story of the game is relatively simple really i say staring down into my encyclopedia of skyrim lore dragons have returned to skyrim through the arrival of alduin the world eater who is resurecting dragons all across skyrim on top of that the empire is now locked in a civil war with the stormcloak rebellion who believe that their nodic way of life is at stake due to the empires outlaw on worshiping one of their gods and thatempire is crippling to the will of the elves who in turn beat the empire in a previous war and now control them through the use of a peace treaty fortunately the last dragonborn has arrived a man or woman or lizard born with the soul of a dragon who is capable of speaking the dragons language and therefore learning dragon shouts or thuums a form of magic that mortals have to spend their entire lives mastering unfortunately youre on your way to your own execution and nearly take the axe to the face too fortunately alduin turns up and intervenes to summarise he basically destroys everything and you somehow manage to escape unharmed tldr youre the dragonborn a mortal with the soul of a dragon whos freed by a dragon unintentionaly from your own execution into a world where giant firebreathing lizards are coming back to life to kill of man and elf kind and the land is torn in half having to deal with a civil war got all that moving on the dlc is pretty decent aswell the dawnguard dlc sees you fighting against a growing vampire menace with the dawnguard essentially paladinesque vampire slayers or fight with the vampires with lord harkon and becoming a vampire lord a pureblooded vampire capable of a rather horrifying transformation to severly increase your magical capabilities eventually you find out the harkon is unwilling to deviate from his plan use a legendary bow tipped with the blood of a pureblooded vampire to black out the sun forever not as threatening as a dragon attenpting to kill off or enslave all mortals but hey at least harkon is trying tldr you get to kill vampires or become a more powerful version of the vanilla games vampire including a whole new transformation the dragonborn dlc sees you travelling back to morrowind upon being attacked by cultists in skyrim turns out theres another dragonborn on solstiem an island off the coast of morrowind but hes not looking to make friends and has enslaved most of the islands population through the manipulation of dragons whats even better is you can learn the same shout thats right who needs a horse when you can fly a fckin dragon into battle tldr you get to go back to morrowind and fight another dragonborn whos using shouts to control dragons then we have the hearthfire dlc its not as exiting as it sounds all it does is allow you to buy a plot of land and build a house on it instead of buying a premade house the house you build can be expanded upon with a main hall and up to three seperate wings wether they be a mage tower an armory a storage room a kitchen a trophy room and the list goes on the interiors re also fully customisable allowing you to place your own furniture display cases weapon racks even armour mannequins nice dlc really but not as good as the previous two tldr youre not just a murderer of mendragonswhatever but an interior designer aswell and if there is something that doesnt quite suit you tastes theres likely a mod for it dont like giant spiders turn them all into bears dont like bears turn them all into giant spiders theres lots of mods that can be found on the skyrim nexus with countless others available on other sites although this game does have steam workshop compatibility id recommend against it if you wish for long term reliable modding these mods vary from simple weapon additions or reskins to complete overhauls of the games systems if you can name it theres probably a mod for it however of course no game is competely perfect unfortunately this game is riddled with various bugs that may emphasis on may not break your game but some just might like removing essential characters somehow loosing muchneeded quest items by simpling having them in your inventory or something else awful this may seem unusual but there are some bugs in the game that are actually beneficial to use like glitching a quest to recieve both rewards from it or leveling skills too damn high for your level through bug exploitation ever casted soul trap on a corpse over and over again go try it ill wait  you done good now delete that save and stop cheating thankfully most if not all of these bugs are fixed with mods most notably the unofficial skyrim patches fun fact its the most downloadedendorsed mod on the skyrim nexus id highly recommend you get this patch mod as well as the patches for the dlcs aswell yep even when doing something as simple as placing furniture in a house bethesda still cant keep it bugfree overall the elder scrolls v skyrim is an extremely well crafted game that deserves to be part of the elder scrolls family along side oblivion morrowind and those other two noone really cares about

hours and hours of fun play with many quests and a world to explore you have the freedom to choose your own path and focus on the skills you want to master i am a fan of the sneaking and stealth attacks possilbe in this game

a great open world game that many people will enjoy even without mods but this is not a game for everyone and there will be a group that doesnt like it but i have put in over 200 hours with another account and encourage you to give it a try

todd howard director of this game once said in a keynote that their philosophy in building a game is the final experience a player will have with the game i think bethesda hit the sweet spot with skyrim no other game will make you feel yourself a hero as skyrim does no other game will make you live a whole new life as you would in skyrim no other game will give you the level of freedom you can have in skyrim no other game looks as rich and vibrant graphically as skyrim and no other game bugs are as fun as they are in skyrim some might debate whether skyrim is indeed the greatest chapter of the elder scrolls saga but i know one thing i truly love this game and i enjoy playing it if i had to choose one game only to play for the rest of my life it would be skyrim because there is so much you can do in this neverending adventure
recommended
i recommend skyrim for those who want an rpg with endless possibilities why because modders never stops developing new mods everyday every week you can find mods that gives you new land and adventures skin and other important aspect to improve your skyrim from vanilla to actually new game i can see this reason why bethesda drops any updates for this game because modders already got it better than what they had been created so finally all i can say is this is a musthave game and you will never ever ever regret owning skyrim
recommended
before you read anymore of this know that i am in no way a roleplaying person i can never get into it enough to enjoy it like some people can however this game is one of the most fun rpgs i have ever played i was my first elder scrolls game so it was a new experience for me i had played dragon age origins and that was the only other rpg i had ever played dragon age origins pales in comparison to this game i tend to find the least productive use of my time in games like this and it was not only the least conducive to the main story line but also the most fun goof off time i cant think of any other games in which you can ride around in circles on a horse and hit enemies with a war hammer while laughing hysterically at the fact that even though you are less than four feet from them they still have a hard time hitting you unless its a giant giants will slaughter you early on dont touch the giants but overall i would give this game a 910 and my only reason for not giving it a perfect 10 is some of the features and graphics that wouldnt be a problem for the industry today are a bit off putting for me though some people more than likely wont care
recommended
what i like about skyrim is its high modability and wonderful supportive community what i dont like is that that community is being turned upside down and against itself through the prospect of paid for mods it wasnt needed before and it wont be needed now nor in the future
not recommended
i really shouldnt have to explain to you why skyrim is a good game and i wont
recommended
this game is so incredibly diverse and complex there are so many things to do and so much content that it is amazing you can literally spend thousands of hours playing this game and still be interested unfortunately this is also its only downside the game is so incredibly complex that you may quit because of the amount of effort and time you have to put in this game imagine being reborn in a new world that you know nothing about that is skyrim
recommended
the fifth installment in my very favourite video game franchise video games in general i feel could stand to learn alot from the elder scrolls series no game has an even remotely similar experience such a richly detailed world go anywhere do whatever you want that`s what makes the elder scrolls series the top franchise in gaming in mind granted there are lots of sandbox games out there but no one does it like bethesda tons to do and all of it is optional as far as skyrim itself goes i feel it`s gameplay wise the finest achievment in bethesda`s history personally the elder scrolls iii morrowind will probably always be my personal favourite i felt the story was just more engaging and the world more interesting that said skyrim is a beautiful place and the story is more engaging then the elder scrolls iv oblivion was combat has never been better the dragon shouts are exciting and useful weapons are varied and the crafting system is deep and satisfying one of my only gripes with skyrim is i feel the magic got downplayed in this one can`t create your own spells any more and many spells from previous games are just gone luckily skyrim is heavily supported by the modding community and there is an abundance of great mods out there that add interesting new content to the game if youhaven`t played it yet do yourself a favor and pick this game up

were going to remove the payment feature from the skyrim workshop for anyone who spent money on a mod well be refunding you the complete amount we talked to the team at bethesda and they agree weve done this because its clear we didnt understand exactly what we were doing weve been shipping many features over the years aimed at allowing community creators to receive a share of the rewards and in the past theyve been received well its obvious now that this case is different to help you understand why we thought this was a good idea our main goals were to allow mod makers the opportunity to work on their mods full time if they wanted to and to encourage developers to provide better support to their mod communities we thought this would result in better mods for everyone both free & paid we wanted more great mods becoming great products like dota counterstrike dayz and killing floor and we wanted that to happen organically for any mod maker who wanted to take a shot at it but we underestimated the differences between our previously successful revenue sharing models and the addition of paid mods to skyrims workshop we understand our own games communities pretty well but stepping into an established years old modding community in skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating we think this made us miss the mark pretty badly even though we believe theres a useful feature somewhere here now that youve backed a dump truck of feedback onto our inboxes well be chewing through that but if you have any further thoughts let us know the peoples voices have been heard now we just need a donation option for modders to get 100% of our support take my upvote again skyrim u beautiful modded time

this has to be my favourite game of all time id never played rpgs before this so i didnt really know what to expect all i knew is it was big and that attracted me to it i played this through to 100% on vanilla settings and i thought the graphics and scenery were awesome then i discovered the modding community the amount of available mods is mind blowing to the point you can create a world so beautiful youll never want to leave 630 hours on multiple play throughs and modding and i dont regret a minute of it buy this game 1110

awesome game ive had it since launch and still play it for hours on end over 1k hours over all for some reason using skse seems to interfere with my hours played so only about 540 are recorded at the time of this review i started off with vanilla for the first 400450 hours the rest were with mods first the workshop mods then lately nexus mods this game was well worth paying $60  cost of the dlc on released i dont regret it at all get the legendary edition if you dont own skyrim already well worth it
recommended
finally bought game in steam 10\10 guys the game is really awesome
recommended
this game i can say is one of the best games ive ever played it isnt perfect but it is a lot of fun for boring times
recommended
this game is purely amazing all of it its just like gta but in the medieval times if you want a modding game this should be your choice this game is amazing to mod and is great even in vanilla receiving this game for 5$ and also being my 2nd game it is fun i have at least more than 20 mods on it from more followers to rebuilding helgen this game has a whole bunch of mods both steam workshop and skyrim nexus 1010
recommended
one of the best openworld experiences out there skyrim is perfect for any player who prefers to create their own character and then to customize how they level up the levelling system is near flawless giving you options between the more melee based heavier type of character the warlock mage or the sneaky theif archer needless to say you can mix it up so for example a battle mage could be created who would be great at swordmanship and armour aswell as spell casting ability the story is probably not as intriguing as skyrims predecessor and sometimes can seem to be a questline you want to progress through just to get it of your quest journal this been said the amount of side and miscellaneous quests which will either be pretty serious or great fun with humour more than make up for the lacking main story to add upon this the amount of these quests are insane and will keep yo treking in efforts to find more graphically the game looks fabulous and if you are the player that likes to add some game enhancing graphic mods then this game is most definetley for you mods are released constantly and really do make your game look better not that it looked bad in the first place the gui works the same as all the other elder scrolls games and will come to no surpise for most players the inventory and skill system has been managed amazingly making it easy to access things in battle the ai has become slightly more evolved but still what you would expect from this sort of game overall i would rate this game 8510 and would say that it definitely is one of the best rpgs i have ever played

microtransactions & you valve and bethesda are now servicing paid mods to gamers the mod creators themselves only take 25% from it these modders are selfemployed bethesda and valve are not legally bound to these people valve and bethesda reinvented microtransactions the most unethical business practice of the decade and it is now an indirect source of revenue exploiting modders for their hard work now its a business it involves money trademarks and possible litigation over ownership of intellectual property bethesda can now rely on modders to work for a pittance while cashing in the profits at the same time avoiding legal issues if there are problems with said mods no support from bethesda either they clearly state they do not support modified games but they sure like the money from these mods bethesda is taking pretty much half the profit and modders who are not employees thus bethesda doesnt owe them anything are left to dry in the sand no rights no protection and if you think 25% is bad youre not taking taxes into account its worse than bad

gameplay its classic tes gameplay search explore kill with swords magic and bows or a mixture character builds are gone just use the skill to level it up dragons are powerful and epic and combat is again not the best but classic tes there must be close to 1000 or in todds words infinity quests for the player to do he right you know too  story predictable but gripping and fun all the way the main story has gotten rid of tedious missions and left only the raw and great missions that said though it still look me 26 hours to complete the main storyline over 3 days and im not even close to the surface of the game graphics tes has not boasted about the graphics but on ultra high i was admiring the detail in every nook and cranny of the game characters look realistic everything just looks amazing easily in the top 5 best looking games ever the game does suffer from a few bugs but a small price to pay almost picture perfect 9810 d  dean buy this game goty

when you think waht is vidya gaem you think of skyrim this is the essence of gaming as a whole in a tight  sexy body 20 gigabyte package if you could suck a games  youd stroke skyrims balls first then skip the fellatio and then shove the shaft in your  and squeeze down they get everything right in this masta piece they got es memes guns modern warfare zombies cremes guns open world feeding spicy stories being afk they have it all if there was a complaint to be had it could only be that it triggered an era of gaming that copied this godlike formula and gave birth to games like pacman halflife last of us and even the renown call of counterstrike so next time you ask yourself to describe the best of gaming just  on your keyboard boot skyrim and install a bestiality mod  610

the first character i made for this game was the most effort i have ever put in any avatar of myself in a game draniros was the mightiest warrior in all of tamriel legate of the imperial legion slayer of ulfric thane of whiterun and solitude archmage of the college of winterhold master and nightingale of the thieves guild and herald of the companions he was a vanquisher of draug and deadra devourer of dragons souls and werewolf seducer of serana this character was the direct effort of 200 hours worth of effort and roleplaying and then i decided to take a break and let my brother play the game and make his own character i thought he would remember to use a separate save i believed he would not forget such a simple thing i was wrong draniros is no more 200 hours of playtime effort dragonslaying and dungeon clearing down the drain i was devastaded heartbroken it felt like i had lost a friend lets out sorrowful sigh and creates new character best bereavement simulator on pc 1010 would sink 200 hours in making a char and then lose it all over again

i hate writing a review for this because its hard to put all the sweet lovin into words also i wonder if writing a review for skyrim has any sense  i get the feeling the only people who read these are fans already so if you lived under a rock and have now found out about it and for some reason youre still unsure about playing this then youre thinking too much and trust me youll love it its absolutely gorgeous theres adventure behind every corner theres a pack of wolves behind every third corner you can eat cheese and fight a dragon at the same time you can do whatever the hell you want soundtrack is amazing and sentimental and draws you in even more the obligatory would play again 1010 would go rafting on the white river again

everyone knows this game is amazing just jumping on the review bandwagon if depth is what your looking for in my current play through i have just hit level 39 whilst only completing 2 or 3 quests from the main story

this my friends is definitely the mustplay game on steam even now nearly four years after the release i wish to go back to the 111111 and just replay the game and experience it without knowing anything about it you usually have reviews that give you facts and numbers to tell how good a game is but what i want to express with my review is how the game touched me back then and how it formed my playbehaviour the elder scrolls v  skyrim made me go insane about the entire franchise and its lore because it was and still is such an immersive game i cant stress it enough but only the fact that there is such an epic mod community makes me replay the game over and over and i cant wait for the two full conversions skywind and enderal thank you bethesda for making this piece of art it truely changed the game history and im looking forward for the next time i can dive into an elder scrolls game
recommended
this is the kind of game where i will say oh ill just play for a few minutes and then stop when i realized that i should have gone to bed four hours ago magnificent game

definitely one of my favorite games that ive easily drained over 500 hours into it combined over the 360 and then eventually the pc it is easily modded to be one of the most graphically stunning and immersive games you can play without really needing to destroy your system and modding it is easily learned as well especially if a friend helps tldr buy this games legendary edition overall the story is rather run of the mill for an elder scrolls game that treks you around the nordic land of skyrim from the marshes of morthol to the warmer forests of falkreath and even to the top of a mountain home to those that will be your teachers in the ways of the voice as you go along you can acquire new dragon shouts of varying effectiveness and usefulness combat is also pretty run of the mill for an elder scrolls game but with a few good upgrades and a little simplifying unmodded when modded it can be one of the best styles of gameplay the way skills are handled are quite well done as well though the attribute system has been removed to favor on the fly building rather than setting it at the beginning and no mind changing allowed the dlcs are ok in my opinion nothing of the same tier as shivering isles but well worth the slight extra cash for the experiences given and the more freedom to mod as many mods use assets from the dlcs even in 2015 the game can hold its own to more modern games and even that of the witcher 3 then again i am an elder scrolls fanboy hope to see many more people adventuring in this new land be it for the first time or a switch to the pc like me be sure to check the nexus for mods and such

after months of waiting to save up for a new computer the time came i was able to play whatever i wanted with no concerns especially with graphics i was ready to sink my teeth into skyrim the first major game i played on here was the elder scrolls oblivion which instantly became my go to favourite game i cant compare the two as oblivion was released many years ago but their similarities are very close the nature and landmarks of skyrim are absolutely breathtaking and being able to see it clearly is spectacular the music is fantastic as usual as i really feel like i am there i love that there is a lot more wild animals in skyrim as well as mythical creatures in terms of combat it feels a lot more smoother than oblivion of course i was excited to join the dark brotherhood because i was able to reunite with shadowmere again yesssss the only thing i would of liked to have remained the same although the conversations with people are a lot better i would of hoped to have had the subtitles at the bottom so i could memorize what they are saying a lot more edit just found out that you can i havent encountered many bugs i believe my first one was last night when my prey ended up floating into the sky i had a brief moment of amusement until it was fixed i havent added any mods i dont think i will do but when i play skyrim from the beginning again i most likely will if you enjoyed oblivion or even morrowind you will definitely enjoy skyrim

its not just a game

words cant explain how expansive and timeconsuming this game is with all kinds of side quests youll probably end up finishing the main quest last dont hesitate just buy it already

this is the game the never ever ends i picked this game up thinking i wouldnt like it having never played a previous tes game before sat in my library untouched for about a month or two and finally took the plunge i was wrong i was so very very wrong this is probably the best purchase ive ever made on steam add in the unlimited potential of modding and its an adventure that continues forever ive probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character and still only have beaten alduin once once theres still so much more do to and explore that im still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things i still cant believe how much there is to do and im still finding more at it stands ill probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as skyrim with how much ive played and im totally ok with that

i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun one of skyrims major cities when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot an orcish mace in the other they were on display for nobody but me and my computercontrolled housecarl lydia who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls dragons a civil war and job assignments that never seem to go as planned its even a sensible thing to do a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim one of the most fullyrealized easily enjoyable and utterly engrossing roleplaying games ever made part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated in skyrim theres no more moonhopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill thats gone so is athletics the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major you dont assign major and minor skills at all but instead pick one of ten races each with a specific bonus high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective closerange combat these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic sneaking and weapon combat emphasizing firsthand experience over instruction manual study letting you specialize only when youre ready it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim do a quest kill a dragon snatch torchbugs from the air munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within little feels random and useless even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities making every step you take even if its through what seems like total wilderness an exciting one as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame momentarily all on the battlefield unite directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature creating impromptu moments of camaraderie  a surprising change from what may have been yet another bythenumbers bandit camp sweep dragons show up often their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles stops to attack circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv can be completed in a few minutes and always offer a useful reward killing a dragon yields a soul which powers skyrims new shout system these are magical abilities any character can use you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time throw your voice change the weather call in allies blast out ice and fire or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force even if you favor sword shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story joined with the thieves guild fought alongside the dark brotherhood or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim not only is this land under assault by dragons long thought to be dead its also ripped in two by civil war you can choose one side or the other but so much of the allure of skyrim is how even outside of the confines of quest lines the embattled state of the world is evident and steeped in a rich fictional legacy lord of the rings this is not but with the release of every elder scrolls game the fiction becomes denser and the crossreferencing for longtime fans all the more rewarding skyrims residents are all aware of current events theyll comment on the civil war some sympathizing with the rebels others thinking the establishment sold its soul the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor many characters feel like whole distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans characters stereotype based on race they doublecross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable and they react to your evolving stature within the world it makes a ridiculous realm filled with computercontrolled cat people and humanoid reptiles demon gods and dragons feel authentic like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave

very long read this is the best fantasy action openworld rpg anyone could ask for btw i probably have over 400 hours because i used to play it a lot on my ps3 so many different mechanics to it smithing crafting alchemy lockpicking enchanting not to mention that it has playstyles for any player agressive players can use heavy armor and twohanded weapons players who want to be quick and agile can use light armor onehanded weapons and a shield or if they want to be sneaky they can use light armor and a bow and arrow it also has magic for people who prefer not to use manmade weapons for attacking a person can use destruction magic magic that involves frost fire or shock or they can summon helpers with conjuration and boost health or upgrade armor rating by using the other three areas of magic the game offers restoration illusion and alteration if you prefer to be somewhere in the middle of how you play magic and combat you can easily become a spellsword combine forces with a bow and arrow and conjuration or just become a warrior that can restore health by magic means with restoration the combinations of playstyles are literally endless and like a perfect openworld game should there is not just one storyline sure you have the main storyline every game needs that but there are various storylines beyond that ones that have you assisting the people of skyrim other storylines do the opposite you can even get married adopt children and buy multiple homes the graphics are amazing already so no one has to worry about bad graphics but even if you dont like the graphics there are mods to make it better just go look at some of the damn screenshots in the community and youll see that the graphics are amazing skyrim is completely moddable mods found on the steam workshop and nexus are easily installed there are endless possibilities as to how you want to mod your game if you want an extra storyline install a mod the most famous mod of that category being falskaar if you want weapon packs install a mod if you want new npcs install a mod if you want new buildings install a mod and if you want to make your own mod go right ahead and do it on top of the already great game the view is spectacular sometimes you just have to sit back relax and enjoy the scenery the elder scrolls v skryim has to offer the player can also commit crimes and go to jail possible crimes include pickpocketing breaking into a house and stealing the stuff in the house forging business ledgers assault murder tresspassing and running up to the execution block when the player first enters the city of solitude will also get them arrested and dont think that the crimes are pointless because you would just end up in jail for them the player can do it so it is not seen and also get perks to get away with crimes more easily and if they dont want to go to jail they can slaughter an entire town every person you kill can be looted along with every creature and they stay there dead in the same spot forever they dont disappear small immersive actions are available in the game as well for example any chair can be sat in you can sit at bars and drink rent out a room from an inn for a day eat food and sleep there is even a quest that allows the player to get drunk and also mods that allow the player to get drunk from any drinking instance well what about if i finish the game finsihed all the storylines there are countless side quests and other objectives you can do finish all those oh wait you cant do that the miscellaneous objectives are literally endless im serious the game will keep giving you objectives as long as you keep doing them to justify the last paragraph a while ago i started a third playthrough of the game and found two entire questlines that i didnt know existed and had never encountered before i looked the both up on a wiki and they were both there just to confirm that they werent mods and to go over skill tree there is twohanded the player learns how to use twohanded weapons which can be either a greatsword battleaxe or warhammer more effectively that includes the ability to do more damage break blocks easier and unlock effects of the power attacks onehanded the player learns how to use onehanded weapons which can be either a sword waraxe or mace more effectively increase damage of one handed weapons learn the art of dualwielding onehanded weapons and unlock different kinds of power attacks heavy armor the player learns how to use heavy armor more effectively take less damage from physical attacks which means attacks other than magical attacks make it so heavy armor does not weigh as much heavy armor depletes less stamina while sprinting make less noise with heavy armor and learn the way of punching oppenents to death < yes im serious about that one light armor the player learns how to use light armor more effectively take less damage from physical attacks make it so light armor does not weigh as much and pretty much every other kind of thing you can learn from heavy armor except you cant learn how to punch oppenents to death with light armor block a selfexplanatory skill tree block more effectively with shields as an added bonus the player can cause their opponents to bleed if they use the shield bash archery use the bow more effectively in combat do more damage slow down time when you draw an arrow cause paralysis with your arrows occasionally get critical hits from arrows more often and make critical hits even more effective than they already are smithing smithing is one branch of three skill trees that involve crafting smithing focuses on being able to craft all sorts of armor and weapons and being able to improve them better enchanting also a branch of crafting enchanting allows the player to enchant weapons and armor more effectively and once the player is advanced enough at enchanting they can put two effects on one item instead of only one effect alchemy the final branch of crafting alchemy allows the player to create very effective potions or poisons available for use in combat sneak the player can get out of any npcs sight easier do more damage with sneak attacks learn to execute silent forward rolls while sneaking and if the player gets amazingly good at sneaking they are then able to start sneaking in the middle of battle but instead of it being pointless the enemies would actually lose sight of the player lockpicking the player learns to pick locks easier and do it without being seen nothing else to say here pickpocketing the player learns to pick pockets and get away with it more frequently and also becomes able to pick a greater variety of items from the unsuspecting npcs pockets i know this already seems like a lot of skill trees but there are still all the magic skill trees lol illusion the player learns to be able to alter how an npc is thinking for example in the middle of battle the player can learn to cast spells that calms enemies down temporarily stopping combat and enabling the player to run away before the enemies go back to normal the opposite can also be done as in the player can use illusion magic to make their enemies angry at everybody for example if the player casted a spell of that kind on a bandit that bandit will start attacking their fellow bandits thus leaving the player with less enemies to fight restoration the player learns to be able to heal or support themselves better via magic there is really not anything else to say about this skill tree i would go on about destruction alteration and conjuration but i literally ran out of characters lol so just believe me and buy the god damn game d perfect 1010

the plot is dragons the graphics are okay the quests are mostly bad but theres some good moments dragons try to roast you but if you kill them you get their souls to give you magic its basically a dragon serial killer simulator also everyone who plays it wants their character to be a naked woman unless theyre a lady then they want their character to be a naked man i guess again dragon serial killer simulator you hunt these guys down avoid getting turned into a dovahkiin sandwich and steal their souls their freaking souls thats more badass than the grim reaper riding a motorcycle made of dead people into the sun while being chased by bears riding fighter jets the quests may not be good but theres a lot of them and most give you gold and weapons gold and weapons  fun i greatly enjoy smashing bandit faces in with a warhammer battleaxe greatsword sword mace waraxe dagger or bow not sure how you smash faces with a bow do it anyway youre a dragon serial killer you can do whatever you want heck get a weapons mod and smash their faces in with even more stuff the maul and halberd are particularly pleasing its even better if you get the dlcs vampire simulator dlc and mushroom land dlc they add stuff weapons thats fun good for smashing faces and let you steal more souls murder more innocent dragons dragon serial killer remember hell mushroom land dlc adds another dovahkiin for more soul stealing badassery imagine the grim reaper sunmotorcycle thing times two theres also another dlc family life fun time simulator which adds children and house building but no stuff thats fun like giant death hammers for crushing the faces of your enemies buy this its good 810

this and the other elder scrolls games are my most favorite rpg games skyrim has more thing to do and more things discover fighting dragons is also a lot of fun this game is even more fun when you get the dlcs for it hearthfire isnt that bad if you like to settle down and have a nice home that you built from scratch you can put all kinds of your own things in it the dawnguard dlc has a pretty good story line with a good amount of new content such as crossbows and fighting while riding horse back you can also be a wicked vampire lord but dont forget about playing as a dawnguard cause thay have some pretty awesome things of there own the dragonborn dlc i have just started playing and so far there is a lot more stuff in it than dawnguard you can tame dragons go to a island that is a part of marrowind fight all kinds of new things and find all kinds of new treasures the story line in it is pretty interesting but over all this whole game is a masterful creation

this is the undisputed king of single player rpgs its insane how much content the developers packed in this game ad how much fun it is to play and explore the huge world if you are in search of a game where you can spend hundreds of hours and still run into stuff you havent seen or done look no further if you enjoy fantasy rpgs this is a no brainer go get it its worth every penny
recommended
one of the best game that ive ever seen

like farcry 3 with swords

worthy addition to the series oblivion was a letdown and skyrim returns to morrowinds unique feel and personality though it can not fully match it skyrim is still a must play for elder scrolls fan and any player who enjoys adventure and exploration the game becomes phenomenal with mods you can feel and live through every moment every battle and encounter best way to play skyrim is to roleplay your character commit to its personality and view the world through its eyes you can really fire up your imagination break free of scripted dialogues and storyline and live through your own story and adventures this will open up whole new way for you to play and enjoy games no longer a mindless consumer addicted to snippets of prewriten script pieces you can forge your own story with every step you make better yet start a journal or video series describing and documenting your adventures get off your read only stasis and start being creative open world sandbox free adventuring are endless fun and possibilities stop being silly puppet unable to think something fun up without explicit designer instructions would you kindly for mods you can check this great thread httpgameovergeindexphpshowtopic2220

i love bethesda skyrim was amazing so much to do does get a little boring if your already use to the mechanics of the game if its your first time playing a game made by bethesda this will no doubt be a wise use of your limited funds to add to your library i highly reccomend this game to anybody 1010

escapist fantasy at its best if you want a strong story or linear gameplay go elsewhere however if you want a game where you can do just about anything and with the robust modding community you can remove the about this is it
recommended
is a fun rp game it has some bugs but dont let that down you can make your owne player and have fun at the same time go and get it
recommended
skyrim one of the best game that i ever played also so beuatiful and very epic in every way there is so much to do so much to find and so much possibilitys i cant to do more than recommended just buy and play
recommended
this game is probaly the best game ever its filled with possibiletys and fun you should buy it
recommended
the best game ever
recommended
one of the games with the most potential but falls short unless you mod it up to its teeth the original game is pretty basic terrible combat system weird plot boring dungeon design but then has this amazingly crafted world thankfull you can mod this game and the mods make it one of the best rpgs on the market
recommended
seriously get this game right now 1010
recommended
you have to save magical norway from dragons be sure to be on the look out for fantasy racism only one ultimate version of every weapon and armor type morally gray the token beast race of every quest betraying you nobody caring that you killed the evil dragon saved the sun from the vampire king and killed the first dragonborn before he could take over some small island nobody cares about taking over all of the guilds despite your related skills being low 9 holds each more morally gray than the last nazi elves ancient machines that still work and look freshly polished lit torches in tombs undisturbed for thousands of years the space core from portal 2 flying mammoths also dont forget bethesda messed up the marriage system so everyone in skyrim is bisexual even though they refer to you as if you are the opposite gender
recommended
does this even need a review get it
recommended
this is game is great
recommended
this game is like bioshock with choices with swords instead of guns and that takes place in midevil fantasy world take it from someone who doesnt play rpgs this game is amazing i know that isnt anything new this game is well known to be great but my point is i avoided it for years because of the rpg element and i regret that decision now i dont blame myself though i blame anyone who didnt describe the game to properly thats right you know who you are the atmosphere is amazing the combat is amazing graphically stellar challenging fun and exciting at times you can play it at your own speed look im not saying anything new here but if you enjoy fpss like dishonored far cry games bioshock half life 2 hell even doom and quake like me then its time to get this game dont let the rpg scare you away any longer like it did for me
recommended
more than your average dragon porn simulator needs more  though
recommended
such an awesome game the mods are awesome cant stop playing it
recommended
bethesdavalve have spelled the beginning of the end of the real modding community the magic of mods are dead if they become paid dlc microtransactions say goodbye to free modding in future bethesda games not that ill be buying them anyway now and yes of course there are still free mods but this is the turning point no one wants to see except money grabbing publishers and a few modders who cant see the forest for the trees
not recommended
paid mods edit the above review went up shortly after bethesda decided it was a good idea to dehumanize everyone in the modding community i have elected to still not recommend this game to set a reminder for what i and many others are against if i were to really review skyrim it would go something like the following vanilla 610 the game is entertaining for 60 hours but seriously lacking in many departments the questlines are boring tedious and short the main storyline is particularly awful the world itself is not very interesting the ui is absolutely broken the rpg elements are shallow the combat and gameplay is generally fun but not noteworthy the previous titles except for oblivion are much more engaging deep interesting fun and worthwhile i recommend morrowind in particular with mods 8510 many of the above issues can be fixed with mods paid mods 010 and a further loss of respect for bethesdavalve

an amazing game that has a lot of potential

wonderful game after i paid $30 for the gamei only had to pay $80 for mods dlc only half of them workedand most of them were fake or stolen to get a quick buckbut im glad to be supporting steam the modders who spent hard time contributing to the communityeven though they only get 25% of profits
not recommended
with the addition of paid mods i can not support this game anymore its sad
not recommended
a lot of steam users are flooding skyrim which is genuinely an incredible  albeit imperfect  game with negative reviews because they understand a new policy allowing mod creators to charge for their content my doctor told me that my diet was insufficient in salt premium mods cannot possibly detriment the hours of enjoyment on both the pc and the ps3 edition that i have recieved from this game any bleating otherwise is for petulant children who hate video games i look forward to bethesdas next installment of the tes franchise

true to all elder scrolls games skyrim takes you from muddled and shady beginnings to become a mighty hero of legend by completing tasks both epic and tirvial alike slay dragons vampires werevolves legions of soldiers and bandits delve into deep dungeons and climb the highest mountains collect stuff store it in random barrels and boxes collect more stuff build a huge rustic mansion with it then spend a week in game moving all yourt stuff from random barrels and boxes into barrels and boxes in your new house find a cookpiggy bank to live with you they call it marriage for some reason adopt a dirty kid and proceed to neglect them both as you go out an slay more dragons and punch a mudcrab i honestly cringe to think of how much time i waste in this game not even really playing it and just dealing with my collection ofstuff most of which i never use im a digital hoarder for no apparent reason considering in the real world i have zero inclination to collect anything whatsoever so theres that this game develops latent psychological disorders but only when you are playing the game anyway this is your typical tes game fare combat and levelling is much improved over previous titles but is still nothing amazing the leveled loot and creatures system is arguably better than oblivions but still manages to reduce the fun factor in my opinion honestly if everything is roughly the same proportionate strength relative to me throughout the entire process i never get the sense of making any real progress plus leveled loot just sucks in general i go through the process of attaining a legendary artifact of the gods at a relatively low level and so im punished for such a feat in that the item is in a diminished state that never improves boo to that there is always plenty of stuff to do though the main quest and side civil war quests are lacking in the epic department mostly out of presentation so the real fun comes from making your own story as always characters suffer from what i like to call bethesda face wherein the emotions conveyed visually hardly match the voice acting usually to a comical effect because its like witnessing wax museum characters acting they try but it always falls short voice acting is decent but lacks variety in number of voices that is graphics are equally decent but can easily be made great by mods speaking of just about anything wrong with the game can be remedied by mods a lot can be said about bethesda mostly negative in my mind but if anything they do a great job supporting the modding community as such every time they release an unpolished and usually unfinished game you can be sure eventually the userbase will turn it into something pretty awesome so as always you do a vanilla run just to see what its all about then use the community to play a game that is worthwhile and never look back to the retail version i have a bit of a lovehate mostly hate relationship with bethesda but tes always keeps me coming back for hundreds of hours of my life because at the very least the lore is fantastic and the sandbox type approach to the world lets me make my own fun if thats not an endorsement i dont know what is tldr boo bethesda yay elder scrolls with dragons huzzah mods punch a mudcrab

seeing as valve has been totally unreponsive in this issue and even going so far as to block dissent this seems to be the only useful way to express opinion on this whole paid mod issue the issue here for me is that monetizing mods means that developers are going to be able to skimp on game features and expect them to added later by mods which they will make money from without work betheda games are notorious for being buggy and their ui are terrible mods like skyui fix this but if mods are monetized skyui has confirmed that they will go to paid mod status we will have to pay extra for the same utility in a game not a good move for the health of pc gaming or the modding community in his reddit post gabe newell expressed that this move was not about making money if thats the case why not back off and work through this slower address community concerns and then make a decision maybe its about not showing weakness but ignoring community concerns or giving nonanswers like gabes reddit post are not helping the issue
not recommended
as much as i like skyrim due to recent events i am giving it a bad review in hope of changing something in this crooked industry
not recommended
the game is fine but having to pay for mods is out right outragous valve hid their microtransactions behind supporting the mod developers the gaming community isnt stupid taking 75% of their costs is one way to make it obvious that this was for valve and not for the mod developers if it wasnt so why not just add a donation button
not recommended
this games time is over and thus no longer worth playing after the initial 12 or so hours it takes to beat the main quest line youll find yourself bored with this sparsely populated sandbox the real magic comes from the mods free which extend and enhance the experience to well over 500 hours no exaggeration in fact mods even fix the bugs the developerpublisher either cannot or care not to fix however with paid mods the modding community that has kept this game worth playing after all these years has been washed away i would not purchase this old and buggy game without access to the mods without the free mods it is only a weekend before youre bored  not worth the price

this game use to be great now it hides all the mods behind a paywall why not use a donate button instead of this obvious cash grab

gameplay is repetitive any enjoyment to be found from mods now behind a paywall gg volvo

cant recomend this game when valve and bethesda are making bad desicions with mods
not recommended
i would love to put a possitive review for this game as it is one of the best games on the market but unfortauntly i have to agree with bob on this one paid mods sucks donkey $$$
not recommended
paid mods are a terrible terrible decision that ruin this game
not recommended
the introduction of paid mods as a way to supplement bethesda is absolutely outrageous i used to love following gamespots featurette on weekly skyrim mods but with the introduction of this nonsense i just feel sick no longer can i be imma get that instead its geez i wonder how much that costs absolutely ridiculous this game was released nearly 4 years ago the continued revenue seen by bethesda from the mod community was already significant but this cash grab is absolutely shameful 25% to the modder 75% to valvebethesda absolutely insane
not recommended
introduced the concept of paid mods to support modders while charging a 75% fee on sales
not recommended
the way that this game has been warped the way the modding community  the community that has kept this game alive for 5 years  has been forced to turn on itself has ruined this game there can no longer exist an innocent modding community a community built solely on mutual respect and love of a game and a hobby i cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone in its current state there is nothing so positive that can supersede the massive negative implemented by valve
not recommended
the recent additon of paying for mods is deplorable sad really changing my review from positive to negative
not recommended
only a great game because of mods if they become locked behind a paywall not worth the time

valve is not giving content creators a fair share of the revenue for mods
not recommended
due to recent events i wouold no longer reccomend this game

the new monetized modding update is nothing more than a greedy cash grab bethesda and valve both each take more than the mod creator does in profits from mod sales this is deplorable business
not recommended
was a great game then they tried to turn it into candy crush with dragons
not recommended
anything that has paid mods is bad and bad for the rest of video games

skyrim is fun game i put in a lot of hours i did everything  i had a great time but listen we need to talk theres an alarming amount of bad and bittersweet in this game the world is larger and more realized than in previous games and obviously the graphics are a lot more detailed but the stat game is a watered down wreck where making and leveling a character lacks depth and decision and all of that great stuff we saw in oblivion and morrowind even the questlines are simplified with less choices in dialog and with boring and samesy objectives compared to previous games where the different guilds really stood apart both in gameplay and flavor if this iteration is setting a trend for a possible vi skyrim could be the last tes game i play
recommended
amazing game i have 250 hours in it and i still havent gotten bored

i played skyrim 2 years late and you know what i say 2 years of wasted time this game is the epitome of an rpgactionadventure game presentation 9510  everything just comes together it just works graphics 1010  some of the best graphics youve likely ever seen especially with the right mods and enbs sound 1010  the soundtrack is the most beautiful i have heard in a video game it really gives you that sense of exploration or whatever it is you may be doing the music during dragon fights is just mind blowing gameplay 9510  the combat is fantastic there isnt much that could be done better here in my opinion it isnt perfect but it comes close enough that you can forgive the very tiny things that you may or may not notice after playing for many many hours lasting appeal 1010  this game will always be one that will draw me back with its infinite possibilites and storyline that will be different every time you play through it get this game you may think you dont like it but you do trust me you do

freedom

like skyrim with guns 1010 ign
recommended
you can kill dragons and get high on sugar
recommended
enjoy hundreds upon hundreds of copypasted dungeons boring enemies uninteresting skills basic spells fetch quests glitches and bugs take in the breath takingly small skyrim if this is a country then how big is the planet as you click on draugrs click on bandits click on falmers click on spiders click on wizards and click on dragons watch as your hero cinematically kills the easiest enemies in any game ever and when you turn up the difficulty the game lazily only increases the enemy health and damage feel like you havent gotten any stronger due to the amazing scaling enemies but people keep telling me that this is the best game ever so i guess theyre right i give this game a 1010
recommended
you get to  dragons in the  unprotected then you absorb their  essences and shout at giant elephants that somehow dont give a flying  but then out of nowhere a giant fat black guy bangs ur head with his floppy  so hard nasa gets jealous of how high you go wiz khalifa be like damn he high
