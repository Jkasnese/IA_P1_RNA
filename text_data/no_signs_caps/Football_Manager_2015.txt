ive bought this game for many years and think this might be my last firstly im not keen on spending 30 a year on something that could be released as an update the lack of competition in the manager genre has made si very lazy to the point where they make one or two small changes and market it as a new game here are some of the points where my problems lie ridiculous injurys in my first season there was not one point where i didnt have at least six players injured how many times in real football does a team make all its subs then a player gets injured and they finish the game with 10 men well in fm about one in three games but amazingly never to the computer opponent its almost impossible to generate any momentum anymore in fm you will be playing well then suddenly lose for no reason football has always been in the headlines for footballers astronomical wages thank god its not like fm youth players who have never made a first team appearance asking for 40k agents of average players asking for 5mill in fees instead of improving things like the ability to see how your players have performed in training during the week to help your decisions on who to play si add tunnel interviews i can imagine the meeting at si so what have the fans on the forums been asking for well their all desperate for more press interviews in the game they just dont feel theres enough as fans of the series we should treat si like an alchoholic relative and not hand over money to them to continue their bad habits in this case their bad habits being treating fans like cashcows that they can just make substandard games for and rely on fan loyalty

there are some good things about fm 2015 which might make it interesting for someone who has never played the series before for me as a pretty hardcore player i feel like im in a vicious circle just feeding my malcontent about the game but cannot break my addiction and hell ive had many spells of fm addiction throughout the last fifteen years but they are only truly rewarding when i feel i can make a difference with my particular style of play and my preferred scenario is the lower league model excessive scouting wheeler dealer kind of approach which is worth very little in 2015 the thing that works the least for me is that i dont feel i can truly play the game the way i would want to play it my expectation is that somehow getting a few amazing players in a league 2 or conference team should show but whether it shows or not depends on chance player ratings are very position dependent with central midfielders taking the runt of bad ratings however amazing they may seem so i might spend hours searching for the coolest prospects i can find fishing for work permits for my noneu conquests but getting phenomenal players on a mediocre squad matters very little the general feeling is of a wooden game bizarre things happen which seem to defy reason some are buggy like goalkeeper reactions some are fixable via lengthy tactical tinkering like defending corners and others are the worst of all monotonous long distance goals maybe on tv a fast player outrunning a defender unless the latter fumbles it keep dreaming half competent goalkeepers seem harder to find than the proverbial needle and then theres an aggressive randomness to how a team behaves and matches unfold my concede within the first ten minutes syndrome seems unshakable i am not saying it cannot be done but the feeling is that it is something that needs to be fixed from the get go rather than something that should be reasonably fine under normal conditions like corners and when theres a huge quality gap between your players and the opposition it all gets hard to fathom so why have i played hundreds of hours of this on the one hand the addiction on the other that elusive feeling when things actually do go right and you win an amzing match but i am left frustrated because fm seems to be going nowhere the development of the game fails to address key issues year after year a balanced match engine a bit of flair and a bit of the unexpected some character and individuality to the players unbiased ratings consistency and logic in the transfer system of course its not easy and theres a lot of back and forth in trying to get it all together but considering the heritage of this series i cannot avoid a distinct sensation of complacency padded with the occasional ui revamp or a couple of shiny new features bottom line if you have not played this yet maybe wait it out some more like until si decide to take the bull by the horns and create another classic there are many people who enjoy working on this game and its database is a treasure trove an inimitable advantage for anyone interested in joining the fray the risk with taking it up is that even if you get it for free time costs incurred are not worth the experience and chances are your passion for football will be your downfall in spite of this

i have played every iteration of the football manager series long before i even used steam and i have to say that football manager 2015 has some of the most glaring issues i have seen within the series manager customization has been inserted and is a step in the right direction but not entirely so you will get to customize the stats of your manager are you more laid back or more technical the option to customize and edit stats as such as adaptability and understand of things like attacking defensive etc are there however i dont entirely know what impact they have on the game as in my 9 hours of playing i havent really noticed it or came across them again i also do not know if these stats improve or worsen over time depending on what you do  as the game does not tell you even in the very brief tutorials the new user interface layout is amazing and is long overdue i actually found that i stopped playing football manager 2014 because of the ui it was clunky it was a mess and i had no idea where anything was it was all just text and drop down menus now there is a nice sidebar which provides links that take you to the most important and most used parts of the game as such as tactics scouting team etc purchasing players is odd this year sometimes it is extremely easy to buy a player and others extremely difficult for no reason  even if you are trying to purchase an already transfer listed player or a reserve player getting no games at his current club the old let me pay 100m on a 48 month deal still works you can buy any player that wants to come to your club if you use this method and it totally breaks the entire game my biggest gripe and the sole reason why i need to give a bad recommendation to this game the ai and the match engine the ai in football manager 2015 is the worst i have ever seen in the series if you actually sit and watch the match unfold you will see some of the following  players running for a ball and stopping for no reason  the goalkeeper saving the ball standing back and staring at the ball which is touching his feet  a player will chase the ball down the wing at full speed slow down and allow a opposing team player to catch up and take the ball  opposing team player has the ball and stands still all of your players are polite enough to let him stand still  outrages tackles ball is moving out of your box opposing striker is running out of your box there is no threat defender will slide tackle him as he is leaving the box and give away a penalty  cbs that seem to play as strikers leaving entire gaps in your defence red cards injuries and own goals  everywhere i have not went through a game yet where there has not been at least one own goal either by my team or the opposing team they are everywhere red cards and injuries happen in abundance  i have had 10 players injured within the first month of a season even though i had average training and not too many games in quick succession tactics do not work as they are intended if you sit down and take the time to read and learn how to create tactics you will be so frustrated the game gives you descriptions of what each position and instruction does in depth this is great however they do not work as they say short passing retaining position and not punting the ball up the park team constantly just fires the ball all over the park with next to no short passing push higher up the park team sits deep because of these issues scorelines can be ridiculous in my first 5 games of the season there was a combined number of 30 goals between me and the other team my first game finished 54 and my second was 63 this all leads to a very frustrating experience overall every year si always say we are improving the match engine where are these improvements i have not seen any improvements just more bugs and terrible ai i love this series and i am a huge football fan but i feel obliged to tell fellow consumers not to purchase this product until it vastly improves

ive been a huge fan of fm going way back before the big split that led to championship manager and football manager since i started this game ive won the league once and the treble in another season im in my fourth season so its not like im whinging because i cant win but there is clearly something wrong with the matchday engine the most succinct way i can put it is that its like theyve decided brazil vs germany from the last wc is commonplace ill keep 8 straight clean sheets or something like that then get beaten by a promoted side 60 or 75 whats more ive noticed other games in the league finishing 86 and stuff like that since i started counting in three seasons ive seen goalkeepers chipped from the touchline or from inside the defending half 27 times the game needs a lot of work its a winning franchise so all they need to do is fix it but dont spend your money on it until they do they have released a very dodgy product ive never seen an fm release like it just makes the game seem ridiculous even when youre winning and thats not why people play this game right

too realistic my arsenal team is getting too many injuries

finally i am starting to fall out of love with this game just too many issues and it appears im not the only one to mention in one review so i will list my biggest bugbears  injuries  like many others each save game has been dominated with injuries fm liverpool fmc liverpool fm custom of course many players get injured but i have rarely managed to field an entire matchday squad without bringing in 23 reserve and youth players this means on average i have about 8 senior players injured 68 weeks is the most common length  training  there just seems to be no improvement on this side of things it is embarrassing that you can only train your whole team as one for example  attacking training there is not one professional team that have all their players do the same group training schemes why would i want the likes of skrtel toure and sakho doing attacking training the majority of the time it is just lazy game designing on top of this there appears to be a bug that a few players in your team are always upset about the high training workload  no matter what you try to fix it  talking to players  again it feels like this is a bit on the weak side you only have the same options available sure you can try to convince players but only with intangible promises  eg promise to bring in high profile players but with no obvious way to figure out if the player you buy is going to appease the player  everything is short term  this is my plan for this season  most clubs have a 3 or 5 year plan you should be able to lay out your plans for your contract entirety  eg have more money in the first year to build a squad that will develop or lay away your transfer kitty for later seasons because the squad you have now will get you promoted etc  teams still wont bid for new players or contract signees  it is very frustrating to buy a kid for the future and have to wait 6 months to loan him out tactics are inflexible  rarely does it work if you want to play a fast short game or a slow direct game this is nothing like real life remember liverpool last season or stoke every season plus they still havent brought back player runs  a huge miss for tactical control the biggest problem matchday  i watch it on 2d to try and avoid some of the bugs but a lot of them still persist the two most common are players not chasing down a loose ball 5 yards away from them and the worst one of allopponent takes a shot kepper makes a save ball comes back into the penalty box keeper watches it for 5 minutes whilst the opponent runs 25 yards to stick it in the back of the netfunny thing is it only happens to your keeper plus the tactics you use dont have a big effect on the game i tested this out by doing the old saverestart cheat against west brom at home tried 442451433 with different player combinations and tacticseach time lost 21 or 20 on the plus side it looks prettier unfortunately as most people point out there is no motivation for miles and the si team to make real improvements each year we will shell out 30 and receive some old rope in return at least now you can play the beta access and get bored of the game before its official release date if you would like to play alternative manager games i recommend fm11 and premier manager 97 those games felt like the developers cared

ive played every single football manager game since the split from championship manager and every single championship manager before that and i have to say this is the first time ive been massively disapointed in the series  it doesnt feel like fm its a skewed imposter some things around the game has improved in subtle ways  match day stadiums looks great the scouting is more realistic than ever but the good ends there the matchday engine has slowly become a joke over the years tolerable but still worsening for the past 3 editions this one being the worst injuries are through the roof in this version even after the hotfix tweaks and its impossible to keep a players fitness up even with squad rotation in addition to the injuries the goals are insane your team will score 100 goals a season with anichebe as your main attacking threat but youll also concede just as many with neuer as your keeper tactics dont seem to matter all that much after testing it seems the main factor is your familiarity with it if its low youll drop easy wins without question as your defenders refuse to perform any type of tackle in all i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone in its current state and i really hope si throw out some massive fixesimprovements and soon

oh boy where to start the pros the game is so indepth detailed and looks great that at first glance you feel like you are in heaven unfortunately the absolutely ridiculous ai and randomness of the game ruins it for brand new players and seasoned veterans alike very quickly i have played football manager games since the 1990s i have bought every game in this football manager series i have probably tens of thousands of hours of experience playing these and have thoroughly enjoyed every fm yet until this fiasco i have only played this one with two teams man united and sheffield united but the experience has been identical the game is so damn unrealistic that it will suck the life out of you these are actual situations that happened in my season with man united a month into the season i have lost nearly third of my team to long injuries some players cannot put together two games in a row before returning to the injury list not totally out of the question but highly unlikely queens park rangers finished 2nd in the epl in my first season while tottenham and liverpool barely missed relegation i finished 9th and got fired i kept beating the top teams repeatedly while collapsing at home 05 to teams like qpr and swansea i lost 50 to a 9man manchester city after winning the shots 145 and hitting the postcrossbar five times frustrating but not impossible but scenarios like this unfold throughout the season the likes of rooney and mata cannot score regardless of opposition or their position on the field while james wilson bangs out a 30goal campaign you can literally have a guy of van persies stature standing on the 6yd line with an empty net and hit the post over and over again and dont even get me started on these phantom goalies you can be playing against a backup to the backup goalie 2 divisions below yours and fail to score while the opposition sinks 3 behind de gea on three shots i scored 2 or 3 goals from direct free kicks all season and maybe twice from a corner my opponents you got it somewhere around dozens now it might sound like im making excuses and dont know how to manage but as i said i have enjoyed these types of games some 20 years whether i win or lose why because the games have been as fair and realistic as a simulations sports game can be sure there will always be that crazy 75 home win against some world class team but when it happens once every 150 games or so thats pretty okay there will always be that game where an underdog takes you down and leaves you extremely frustrated but guess what it actually happens what doesnt happen are the scenarios i discussed above and after some 150 hours into fm 2015 i feel like i have enough personal experience to call this game total garbage fortunately fm 2013 and fm 2014 are still installed on my computer and still offer limitless hours of fun and entertainment do not waste your money on this game play the older installations and wait until sports interactive gets their crap straight a major major disappointment

its another year and another football manager game i will play it for countless hours again because i am addicted to this sort of game and i play fm because frankly there is no alternative does this mean i will either recommend it or give it a good review once again not this year the lack of ability in si to actually listen to the reviews of its customers is just awful this is a company that has been excellent in the past at implementing user ideas in the past few season such bugs as far too many injuries they argue there are fewer than real life blah blah and goal keepers who just let the ball in after catching it have been glaring issues just to name two examples but i could go on like this for hours with things they just choose to ignore or tell us are not issues at all the new user interface is just trash especially the tactics screen and this does not seem to be getting addressed despite cries from the user base once again i dont really need to write a long list of things wrong with this game just quickly browsing the review section here will show you what is sorely missing and what is over looked i want to love fm again but it looks like they are just making too much money and only listening the fan boys on their main forums to care about the user base anymore

pros love the new layout and skin communication with players is better than ever love the new options in transfer and contract negotiations cons way too easy to sign top players and the 48 month payment options are pretty broken they should take more out of your budget for them since at the moment you can spend 100m on a 25m budget match engine is terrible best way to win is by playing like big sam hoof it up to the wingers and have a big man in the middle keepers are also terrible constantly fumbling into the path of oncoming strikers getting caught in posession and passing to the opponent defenders cant mark in the box and miss free headers constantly i would say 34 of all goals come from a cross or a keeper  defender doing something shambolic overall great new features coming at the expense of all the simple things if they fix the match engine then this could be a very good installment currently 410 if patched 910

apparently someone who makes the match engine died because the whole ing thing is a disaster the most realistic football simulation game offers realistic scorelines such as 73 62 and ive even seen an 88 draw defending is non existent goalkeepers take about 10 minuites to get up after they make a save and the whole thing is just broken i lost 50 when my team had 15 shots 6 on target and they had around 5 shots 3 on target 2 of them were own goals and the rest were rebounds from the keeper if you call that realistic i have no idea what league you are looking at i hate when people say its your tactics ive tried every tactic possible just to get some results and nothing works i started about 3 saves now i like the new layout and the game mechanics but the match engine is godawful and unfinished to the point where i question if its a football game why the  is the match engine so bad when it was amazing on fm14 go back to 14 everybody where you can get realistic scorelines tldr  nobody can score nobody can defend goalkeepers are apparently disabled dont buy it until a patch comes out

si seriously need to listen to the players more the match engine hasnt been good for years players are easily unsettled if they dont play games due to injury they want to leave for more football the new promises feature would have been amazing if you werent forced into making promises the game doesnt even allow you to keep some promises i had a player wanting to go out on loan i made th effort and he rejected all the loan offers a month later he wants to leave the latest update was pointless in my opinion the whole point of a hotfix update is to address specific problems but all i have noticed is a couple match engine tweaks and the other obvious ones stated on the change list there are still many problems in the game so they might has well have fixed them all and make one big update this games not even been out a month yet and its still not fixed im just playing the game waiting for the next update and when it comes im waiting for another update the same thing happened with fm14 the game was only playable after the update in april and by that time i got bored of the game please dont make us wait until april again for this game to be playable

do not waste your money i spent 35 quid on this game and its the worst one in the entire franchise maybe its just your tactics is coming from most of your lips now wrong unless you are one of the top clubs in the world you will find things such as limited tackling never when its needed ai always get every second ball terrible players can run faster than usain bolt every game has the opposition score a world class goal against you from 40 yards impossible to stop combined with the no tackling your players kicking the ball out whilst trying to pass gks animations forcing them to fail to attempt to save goals rblbs are useless might as well have 9 players the ai is insane always making perfect tackles interceptions from across the pitch because your players try to walk to the ball 90th min goals 5foot 6 players out jumping a 65ft player none existant marking throw in  pass  goal always with the ai no long throw tactic defence every long ball will go to the ai team simple catches have gks in fits gks rushing out and flapping gks code has them try to catch balls on their flight paths only for the ball to go to the first man and they have an empty net players walking through other players without taking the ball no marking from passes 5 defenders in the box one opposition striker he gets the ball and vollys it across goal players on the post wander off as soon as a cornerfreekick is taken players walk away from their markers when the ball is active strikers usually yours 910 times in an offside position insert name didnt mean that goals are happening nearly every game touchline team talk has no effect to anything players do not listen to the tactics shooting less results in a cm player taking the same amount of shots as with it off the graphics are pretty poor ai will kick balls through your players bodies no pressure hoof balls up the field injuries every game leaking goals faster than the titanic leaked water all of the above has come from about an hours worth of play the engine is ablitorated all logic and reason goes out of the window maybe some of the above might relate to my tactics but a huge % are serious flaws within the game

not saying this is a bad game not at all i have played football manager since 2012 and know the game in and out now this is the most fun football manager but is the most fake as in a season only having one 00 game where i play defence with counter attack still does make for an interesting season having 127 goals and 58 conceded is interesting to watch as well do not get me wrong but this is the most unrealistic football manager they have put out its a joke how many goals go in and how much is just plain unrealistic example first game in the prem just got middlesbrough promoted playing against liverpool games ends 86  86  how does that happen if you want an unreal intense football manager where it is all goals goals goals then this is for you if you want a football manager go and play the last year and just download a mod that updates teams for you because this is not a football manager pros   a lot of goals  never a dull game  more indepth communication with player and staff  in match team talks  better transfer and overall balancing  always fun most game end with a min of 3 goals  more goals goals  goals for every one  being able to speak to a player who does not want to come instead of being blocked by agent gives more scope to get players out of your range cons   very unrealistic  random injurie spells not always but can end up having 9 players out for 3 weeks after 2 games and two weeks of training so always save and quit when this starts as when it does the injuries will not stop until you cannot field a team  no matter strategy you will score a lot and concede a lot  could still have more depth i still think it has got too streamlined from 2012  players seems to get very unhappy fast and all seem to being a stubborn as a mule unless you use the talk  x player is having good form no matter the form they seem to agree with you  having a one 00 in a hole season and 3 strikers with more than 20 goals and top 6 goals scores in the league all having more the 30 goals kind of makes it seem very unrealistic  german league rights have gone and still no badges for most top flights teams  mods do fix both mind overall for people wanting fun 710 people wanting a football manager 310

lets be straight forward scroll to the bottom for indept review this year the boys have really taken the game to the next level the game has fixed many issues in the past and almost faultless compared to the past 2014 & 2013 versions things that i really enjoyed  the new interface is very nice but does take time to get used to  match engine y fantastic compared to the past though minor issues with ball bounces lack of roll  the new function to choose the type of manager you are gives the game a more indept feel  frankly the new functions gives you a lot more abilities in managing and structuring your team  tunnel interviews though i personally hate press conferences im lazy the tunnel interviews are a very nice touch things that bug me a bit about the game  the match engines ball bounce is a bit static and does not flow  players opinions seem a lot stronger might just be because i am a new manager  the new interface takes awhile to get used to im still getting my head around it overall my review visuals 810 game engine 7510 gameplay 910 game interface and user friendliness 710 verdict 810 definately recommended ___________ football manager 2015 is the next lineup from its previous stage 2014 equiped with an massive overhaul of the games features and interface this years product was definately highly anticipated so here is my review of the game interface frankly it is definately a fresher look to the game the new interface allows for players to have greater ease and control in getting to different areasdepartments that they need to quickly eg boardroom or squads the overhauled interface tries to bring back memories of the older versions of fm with a updated twist and many users may have a hard time readjusting backto the new interface personally i feel the new interface is a nice idea however does make things a bit complicated in situations but i believe it is simply down to it being new give it a couple daysweeks and you should be comfortable with it verdict 710 game engine with sega taking the game engine to a new level this year this was simply one of the most awaited feature of this years game and guess what it didnt dissapoint with visuals now smoother and insync with the game it is visually astounding when compared to 2014 slicker moves and more cohesion in game less ping pong of 2014 it certaintly is a big upgrade however my criticism would be the ball physics as the bounce does give it a edgy feel with unrealistic and rather static bounce features no matter the angle of the kick verdict 7510 fm2014 was a 5510 gameplay frankly the new features have possible added difficulty to the game which is definately a plus point especially since many users grow tiredbored of the ease of winning in fm 2014 though made slightly tougher it is an interesting addition with new manager formats to choose from finances and training did get a wanted boost and are you as a manager has more opportunities to manipulate work with them to your advantage the gameplay is definately a joy to behold verdict 910 overall look no game can be perfect yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine but for a simulator such as this fm is frankly amazing overall i have to say that football manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all football fanatics if you are a past fm player and have been dissapointed with past versions i honestly beg you to revisit your perspective and try out fm15 please it is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money final verdict 810 [b] hope this helps in making your decision

i love football manager but they really messed up with this version the transfer screen is a mess and it is hard to find new players everything has been hiden in strange menues and wen you finally find the thing you want to do you cant remember where you found it the live game is like watching a game with kids it is not uncommen to see 89 players in a small area and noone can hit the ball the keeper has two settings catch every ball or drop everything it is not uncommen to see your keeper jumping high and it takes forever to hit the ground again that makes it so easy for the attackers to score it is not a bug its a feature dont get me started with the freekicks if your player has a higher rating then 1 i freeking you will score if it is nearer then 90 meters from the goal oh i forgot about the demands from the players i played my first season as brndby and 8 eight ing players demanden to be sold that was devestating for the morale of the team but come on i cannot sell 8 players in one transfer period at the end of every season do some different players demand to get sold and they get angry and so do the rest of the guys if you do not let them accept an offer not just any offer ooooh no but a offer from the last transfer period that is just plain stupid you cannot sell a player in a closed marked the game sucks bigtime it is harder then ever so even if you plays manchester united against bradford you still are up for a huge chalenge dont buy this game its a mess and not worth the money stay with fm14 i know i will undtil most of the bugs are fixed httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvafunukqvity

first of all id like to say ive been a football manager fan for many years now dating back to the late nineties and the good old days of championship manager i havent played much of the game thus far so this mini review is based on my early experiences i was looking forward to this years release hoping it would be a massive improvement on last years title unfortunatly this isnt the case all the things i hated about fm14 are still very much present in fm15 and much more personally when i play the game i like to take control of a small team and work my way up the career ladder rather than taking control over a ready made team such as barcelona or real madrid for example now i understand when playing in the lower leagues the game difficulty is increased and as the player you need to be more mind full of this the the fact of the matter is in fm15 it is impossible to build a team from scratch unless of course you cheat or have a ridiculous amount of spare time and no i dont want to play classic mode player wages and contract renewals are a joke the demands of players at the lower league level are just unfair resulting in the player leaving on a free and subsequently joining another team at the same level but for lower wages it honestly has me pulling my hair out at times players would also choose retirement form football all together over playing for a small team on low wages surley a footballer would want to get his career back on track and get himself in the shop window everyones a winner the club could get some much needed investment through a big transfer sale and the player is back playing pro football i mean cmon whats the point just so the game can make room for the thousands of pointless 15 year old regensdoesnt include under 18 squads that will never play a competive matchever not that youll know how good they are anyway seen as scouting takes forever and when they do return with a report the attributes are all ranged for instance pace could be between 8 and 15 now in theroy i do like this idea it makes sense and encourages the player to make the most of the scouts at his or her disposal in pratice it sucks big time to many numbers wedged into a small box not a good design and again just adds to the confusion with that in mind i recommend ticking the dissable attribute masking box upon starting a new game you will still find ways to utilise the scouts the match engine once again is so so poor trust me im not being over critical just honest but if you like seeing burger vans outside the staduim youll probably love it even if you are losing 60 and every goal has contradicted your tactics in every possible way a tactic i might add that you spent hours on before hand tactics have become confusing how on earth fm can attract new players to the franchise is beyond me the game offers no help whatsoever to the first time player and a guide showing you around the new skin just doesnt cut it even a experienced player note not good ha ha such as myself have felt a little out of my depth and i have felt on a few occasions unsure on what i can actually do to stop a losing run or how to tighen up a leeky defense hell im unsure at times what exactly it is im doing right when im winning the point is my back room staff need to contribute more telling me to close down a player isnt always enough tell me who would be best to use to close a player down stuff like that player instructions just dont work half the time you concentrate on a certain asspect of the team and the game will punish you in other areas if you dont want to lose the shape of your team defensivley and as such instruct the team to close down less the ai simply score a high amount of goals from outside the box reguardless of the goal scorers long shot attribute or the ball would be given away in a dangerous area like a horrendous back pass etc its like the ai gets the hump when you out smart it fm has lost its spark there is no fun in playing anymore its like it has forgotten what it is and that quiet simply is a computer game nothing more nothing less its gotten far to serious for its own good the days of winning the champions league with dag&red are all but gone i have put in roughly 1112 hours into my first save and im half way through my first season having won only 2 games i feel right now like unistalling and going back to fm 13 or even 12 im not saying dont buy this game but i am saying to be mindful you could find yourself shouting at your computer screen a little more than usual things will get broken trust me but i suppose thats what fm is all about right real football mangers get stressed so it makes sense for the most realistic football management simulator for follow suit correct im sure there are alot of good things about fm15 and maybe my tactics and team selection were crap however having just lost 65 to 10 men barrow the bad outweighs the good its a real shame but i truely feel fm has gone down the same road as fifa where the only real change to the game are the updated summer transfers and im gutted i really am

short version revised as of may 13th 2015 updated after completing roughly 15 years worth of seasons between various leagues tldr fm15 has improvements over fm13 and fm14 but feels like two steps forward and one step back veterans of the series will see that some of their main concerns have still not been addressed while other unwantedunnecessary changes were made my rating 3 out of 5 a more detailed review can be found below long version pros more dialogue choices for meetingsplayers  these conversations have more benefit than previous games and stuff like tunnel interviews assistants also seem to give better advice about addressing your team than previous games too ability to individually train players you can choose what positions what playing styleshabits they learn and what individual stats you want them to focus on transfers seem a bit more realistic  especially when a club does not want to sell a player same goes for staffing transfers my only complaint is when it comes to trying to recruit quality youth players and the clubs want 40m for them i mean i get it but no 15 year old kid would realistically be bought for 40m euros adding benefits to transferscontracts seem to properly influence negotiations weeklymonthly payments bonuses even buyout clauses all seem to effect the overall bartering more players youth in particular with potential but less become actual allstars after the first season or two a lot of my focus goes to developing youth players with potential id say out of the eight who were 4  to 5 start potential only three of them wound up at 4 star ability neutral the interface is much simpler and easier to navigate excluding the tactics menu but takes some getting used to it feels less intuitive at first especially for those familiar with the normal ui but eventually becomes easy to navigate the match engine is kindof improved  but many of the same problems 40 shots vs 1 shot and you lose 01 that kind of stuff are still ever present 3d engine has occasional glitches during highlights but never anything game breaking cons there is still a ridiculous amount of injuries this was one of the problems i complained about most during the beta and while it does seem to be toned down a bit its still a huge issue i understand that injuries happen in real life but this is far too much a good example i was playing a season with dortmund and had a 10 day international break during that time four of my starters were all injured three of them in the same game and were all on the same team theyve fixed most of the buggy ui but i personally like to play the game in windowed mode and split screen with a live game or a movie or something many of the ui elements dont seem to account for this and either render incorrectly or reverse preferences  settings every time you change the screen searching for playersstaff doesnt always yield proper results even if you enable the large database and whatever leagues you are interested ive still struggled to find some players or staff that actually exist in my game when trying to use the name search in the scouting field if i go to the club and look for the player however i can usually find them i touched on this a bit under neutral but i feel like some points are worth reiterating about the match engine considering the game is based around it the game struggles with the same tactic fits them all logic like most of the previous generations have and there is definitely the same amount of shoddy logic like players missing open net shots injuries occurring when no contact is actually made and much more conclusion if you are a veteran of the series i personally think the biggest hurdle will be learning the new ui the game hasnt really made any massive improvements over fm14 and it seems like the devs neglected to address some of the main complaints from the past between this and the constant injuries that plagued the game  i found myself constantly making backup saves just in case five of my players come back from an international break with an injury overall im fairly happy with fm15 granted the majority of people purchase these games just for the updated clubs and all that but the game has a lot of potential as always im personally a bigger fan of fmc than i am the more traditional fm but they both have been improved on overall its definitely a step in the right direction though if youve played football manager before and didnt enjoy it this one isnt going to make you love it any more than the past ones id recommend waiting to pick it up on sale or even holding off until fm16 comes out if you are on the fence if you have fm121314 you can get your footie manager fix without missing out on much

football manager is not a game until you have loaded football manager up you will not have discovered the wonders that lay inside you start about 900am in the morning you think ill just play a few hours then go get something to eat before you know it the years 2022 and your new youth prospect david moores has scored a hattrick against manchester united real madrid are bidding 40000000 for him but the lads been with you since he was 16 you discovered him in the depths of the crewe academy and you dont want to let him go but the brat wants a new challenge hes telling you that if he doesnt go hes going to start making the dressing room negative then it happens you wake up you realise that it was just a dream david is happy to stay at the club football manager is not a game its a part of your life

ridiculous match engine which sees many matches end 44 64 55 etc you will go 30 up and use containing tactics to protect your lead only to conceed 5 second half goals and lose 35 ive already had 3 goals scored from attacking teams own half ie 6070 yard strikes most goals come from rebounds from the keeper or the woodwork its all just a bit broken i have been playing football manager since its amiga championship manager days and this has to be the worst effort yet i usually wait for these titles to go on sale but bought this one at full price eager to get hold of my teams watford potential promotion winning squad never again will i pay full price for a football manager game very disappointed i am sure future patches will address some of these issues but they never should have released an unfinished unbalanced game

ive played fm for many years now and i didnt get into fm 14 due to its issues that had at first and now this also has some issues i did two seasons with fiorentina and scored 100 odd goals the first season and came 2nd the problem is no defence like we conceded 6869 goals and its not tactic related like others have said the teams you play against always wondergoals you cant do anything about and also i duno if its just me but i get a crazy amount of offsides like at least in 10  games both teams 12 offsides also other noteable problems are injuries at least it was realistic at this point when i took charge of arsenal literally in 4 days like 6 injuries to key players some big ones untill patches are out i wouldnt recommend this

an important public service announcement do not i repeat do not buy this ing piece of utter horse  under any i repeat any circumstances the match engine is ed beyond all recognition it will drive you insane thinking that the game is scripted but it honestly is not it is just so ineptly designed that even now after years of releasing these games defenders will still trap the ball then run away from it allowing the opposition free goals why is this happening laziness and complacency on the part of the developers do not spend your money on this ing shithouse unless you feel justified in feeding their evil empire i found out the hard way you have been warned

time for yet another fm and instead of the usual praise to the sky i find myself struggling for words i played as fc copenhagen within a month i had 8 firstkey team members out with injuries  and not just the common cold mind you  no oh no one with a broken ankel two with damaged tendrons a broken foot etc the shortest injury was 3 months  i feel like im running a community hospital rather than a football club anyways we recover and start winning some matches  except we dont for some odd reason it seems like you can dominate a match to the point where even the opponents fans are rooting for you and yet they still pull a comeback at the end draws galore 1 shot 1 kill so to speak but heck lets review some of the positives as well great realistic scouting system good layout aaaaand yup id recommend you wait purchasing this game until another update has come out do it for you own sake and for ours  the unfortunate souls that purchased this game in good faith that it would be the high standard the game usually is let them feel the heat so they can fix this asap

tldr  worst game in the series bar none what an fing disgrace actual review  many game companies fall into the habit of getting caught up in the new features each iteration of their game come out with while neglecting the problems inherent in the core game itself we get it its hard to sell a game to new customers if the biggest thing you can advertise is we toyed with the balancing all year or we sorted out all the issues with the code fm unfortunatly has fallen into just that trap anyone who has played the past several years of fm can tell you that while many new features have been added they have by and large slapped onto a  foundation of code that struggled under the weight of a match engine it could not adequately support watching your 30 million pound striker send a suicide mans backpass to the keeper from an attacking postion wingers shooting at impossible angles on goals keepers booting the ball off their own players and into the goal and so on any person with a shred of computer programming literacy could tell you that what si needed to do was go back to square one instead si made the mind numbingly awful decission to slap a brand new considerably more complicated match engine on top of their  code and had the gall to advertise it as a completely new product low and behold you have one of the worst footy simulators to have graced this earth it colapses under it own weight with comical regularity just watch your players freeze on the pitch for no reason like someone turned the power off no patch is gonna be able to polish this turd id suggest buying an older more stable version if you have to have your fix but then youd be supporting these crooks

well this is it the last fm game ill ever buy for full price its not a bad game on its own but charging aaa price for this yearly database update and on top of that shamelessly charging 45 euros for the ingame editor is the last straw for me at least give the preorder buyers a 40% discount and a free ingame editor because your yearly rehash is highly overpriced right now sisega honestly i dont know what i was expecting out of this years game it has been exactly the same for what 56 years now and thats only if you count the annoying interviews and the 3d engine take those away and its the same exact game i played 12 years ago that would not necessarily be a bad thing if they didnt ask for so much money the things the game gets wrong as si would put it include but are not limited to the economy is screwed up still the poor low reputation clubs still ask that you pay more than the players market value yet they set your club with their real world budget and debts they really dont give a damn its all about rich clubs and england as usual because the premier league is the only important one out of 100 leagues 100% of people play in the premier league right the 3d match engine still looks and acts janky as all hell defenders will just stand next to the loose ball while the opposition striker is charging in at full speed the amount of goals scored is currently too high to be remotely realistic i never had a game without scoring only 3 without conceding i beat one team 103 played 15 competitive matches scored 51 and conceded 24 goals so 75 goals in 15 matches if i count the 4 friendlies it gets even more ridiculous the game still has the cheating match engine you lose to a weaker team you know it was set up so you reload the game to test it you lose again maybe 10 reloads later you get a draw but you wont win until you give up the 3d engine and switch to text mode or til you thats right folks until you buy the ingame editor and fix the game   call me a noob and ill just delete your comment and assassinate you when you arent looking ive been playing the game for 12 years and i know my tactics and training setups wouldnt be fair if i didnt say anything positive about this years changes would it now  i like the new interface as for the recommendation if you own the last years game or 2013 2012 2004 dont buy this game the semi updated 3d engine has nothing good to offer and the rest of the game is totally the same the database update is not worth the money until the game goes 75% off if you dont own any fm games but would like to buy one get it at 50% off if youre like me and preordered it go to the steam store and look at games you could have bought instead and cry or keep playing this theyre bound to patch the stupid out of it at some point right right finally here are my scores for the game full price score  510  absolutely not worth 50 of any world famous currency except rubles maybe 50% off  710  if youre shaking and fifa 15 doesnt help you might want to give fm 15 a shot 75% off  810  get it and enjoy it by the time it goes down to 75% off the patches should soften the rough edges youll be getting the best version of this years game at a reasonable price

until we get a fix for injuries this game is unplayable no matter what i do all the players get injured for many months it is impossible to play the devs say it is low compared to real life but its a lie in real life we dont see so much injuries lasting for so many months so often this is bull btw ive prepared my players with a lot of conditioning training in preseason and everything but it doesnt matter they still get injured almost every game and in between one another

i love the football manager series this game has potential but it has some serious teething issues and needs updated the high score lines and players getting injured every game is very unrealistic and not up to usual standard ive been playing fm since the start and was put off by the mix reviews on here but decided to try it for myself  i dont understand how people can honestly enjoy or reccommend this game in its current state pros looks good and performance is fast new interface is good and easy to use once you get used to it scouting has been improved cons far too many injuries at least one per game leading to a selection crisis no matter what team or league i pick far too many high score lines 44 64 75  43  even against lower league teams goal keepers are slow to get up after a save defending is poornon existent no matter what team or tactics you deploy  i have yet to keep a clean sheet far too many goals from long range against you far too many goals conceded from crosses one game with everton vs new england revelation i had 30 shots on target and scored 2 goals they had 6 and they beat me 62 its not very realistic and what i expect from a football manager game  i can put up with the high scorelines but the constant injuries is infuriating no matter what team or league or the set up in training etc  even the reserves seem to pick up injuries  you shouldnt have a selection headache due to injury a few games into the season it has potential but im only a few hours in and these issues have put me off i expected to be lost in the game and have 20 plus hours gameplay by now i simply cannot reccomend this until they address the issues

the match engine is very unrealistic i believe that i stand for most fm players when i say that the best attraction for this game is the tactical ingenuity that we the players can display that wins matches and title yet the tactical changes we make is not reflected during the actual matches the man managing aspect of the game is also overly complicated managers now also have basis stats for our tactican attributes which does not make any sense the biggest problem nonetheless is the tactical and match engine the tactical gameplans are not reflected on the pitch and neither are the attributes of the players the poor match engine results in goal galores that are just too unrealistic

as much as i love the franchise and the previous releases this one just doesnt do it for me its a horrible game atm realism non existing its basically fm14 with a sidebar more time wasted on annoying interviews and an if you can belive it even worse match engine the worst one so far in any fm game imo it has the potential to become a great game but it needs so so so much work that i dont think si will be able to pull it off before the release of fm16 im not going to recommend this game right now but if there is a god then it might be worth it to check back in 2 or 3 months to see if anything has improved cheers

playing fm since 20002001 the series is my favourite of all time across all genres the last 3 years however the game has been getting gradually more of an exercise in ambigious tedium than the magical gaming experience it used to be i appreciate the people at si need to change the game to justify the price tag i just dont know why they insist on breaking the game to do so i can only hope the truly awful new features im looking at you tactics screen will be patched they wont though way too much pride god what ive give for the return of slide bars id also love some explanation no matter how vague for how the 10 million different variables that can affect the outcome of a match actually work im certain si changed the way things like tempo work in game for different tactics without mentioning it or eve updating the tips bar poor form moreover having touchline shouts pressers player interaction 3 teamtalks its too much and its for the most part very very boring as for the me just like with fm14 and 13 at release its broken you would think after 2 poor mes at release si would have the integrity and self respect to deliver this year i remember when si used to release games that didnt need a single patch i think the monopoly si have over the genre has made them complacent its only natural i suppose do not purchase until they have fixed the game maybe in mid march 2 months before the season ends d

i have been playing football manager for years and so far this is worst manager ever just some facts out of my head  injuries seriously so many of them and every one must be for few months and if it is in game it is always after you already have made all three substitutions  transfers look out a bit in real world players in lower leagues or in clubs with budget troubles do not ask monstruous amounts of money for their players and you dont pay player worth 50k more than 500k but in this manager you pay it for more than 5m  players atributes i wasnt sure before but i am now they are crap in my team i have strikers with amazing attributes for strikers and hey cant score if their life depend on it but on the other side strikers in other teams with crappy attributes score 20 goals in season like they play in minor league  interviews if i wanted to read that much and respond to all those questions i would buy a book or go to online chat and not waste money on this game i feel like i am playing celebrity manager instead football  ai now this is special story in last manager it was bad bit it was managable in this on it is so bad that i want to ask for refund of my money examples you are playing great in first half then in secon without any reason you just start playing like local division club and easily loose by few goals whenever you play agains favorites your players get injured early in start of match or you get red card or penylty is awarded against you same goes when some favorite is playing bad in season dont wory they will bounce back to winning agains you then there is unreal match chances like in first 5 minutes your opponent have 10 chances in order for you to score you need 10 on target shots while your opponents need 2 or 3 or how often happenes when you ar strong favorite that other time outplays you on home game with 3040 chances agains you in this managet that is every other game i am curious has ever any of the guys that developed this  of ai watched a real football game

after 250 hours of game play its time for a review of fm15 ive been playing these games for a long time since cm9697 since you asked and honestly i think this one is the best yet there were some early problems with the match engine and the inverted wing back role is still broken he stays wide like a normal wing back but the vast majority of the most glaring issues high scoring games regular goalkeeping errors etc have been fixed in sis patches and in good time as well i thought the motion capture animations in the match engine would be a bit of a gimmick but that has turned out to be a welcome addition to the game on an aesthetic level its by no means hyperrealistic to the point where youd be unsure whether youre watching a match on tv or in fm but its a big step up from the hand drawn players of fm14 the realism or lack of isnt a deal breaker for me all i want to see is a realistic simulation of a football match and in fm15 thats what we have for the most part if you watch the matches on comprehensive highlights or higher then you can easily see your tactical decisions playing out in front of you as the game ebbs and flows and for that if nothing else fm15 is the best edition of the football manager series so far setting up a tactic is fairly simple although not fool proof but like any simulation its easy to get in to and difficult to master one thing i have noticed though having spent a lot of time talking to other players and reading some of the reviews here on steam is that this is not a game for players who want to just pick a match day squad and have a handsoff approach to management you will succeed at fm if you make sensible tactical choices always be mindful of balance in your rolesduties and dont use the same approach for every match you play every match will play out differently the most common complaints ive seen from others are regarding injuries and dominating the game yet losing in the dying moments of the match for injuries i dont have these problems as i make sure my players are fully fit use preseason wisely allow your players to ease into it after coming back from holiday then train hard and play lots of friendlies once the season begins lower the intensity of training and give them all individual set ups it takes a while but if you do this your players will be much less prone to injury and will develop faster as well there will be injuries of course but i dont have anywhere near the issues others are having and most of my injury problems are ingame due to my aggressive high pressing style on the domination side of things i will say that more shots and possession does not mean dominance choose your battles wisely if youre the bigger team you can expect your opponent to sit back and hit you on the counter counter this yourself by playing patiently and forcing mistakes your creative players will take care of the rest im not an fm expert but if you take these simple words of advice then you will see for yourself how quickly things will turn around for your team the only thing i cant comment on yet is the ais squad development in the long term as i havent gone far enough into the game yet in past fms this has been a problem but i can already see less instances of the ai spending millions on a player only to let him rot in their reserve team as si say themselves itll never be perfect itll never be finished so as long as you go into the game with that mindset youll get the most out of it i highly rcommend this game for anyone who watches football analytically or who thinks they could do a better job than their favourite teams manager

i have played every version of this game since it came out like any crack addict i was compelled to buy knowing the risks hell i even upgraded my pc just so i could play the game properly because the last two incarnations just wouldnt work on my battered old machine there are always problems when it first comes out ive found that the problems persist until a patch comes out in decemberjanuary now for the breakdown good  the user interface is so much better there is more interaction with players you can force moves out with a gentle discussion  a great innovation bad  whats going on with the tactics i was scoring plenty of goals but i noticed that i was conceding far too many maybe it was my tactical setup so when i went into a 30 lead i decided to shore up my defence i dropped my defenders back and even my wingers yet once again i was conceding the same sort of goals  a cross into the box and finished because my full back was somewhere else or more usually the goalie making a save and the rebound always falling to their striker the end result was 43 my stats showed i had the tallest team in the league and thus scored most from corners however i also conceded the most from corners wtf i developed one tactic where i gave up trying to win away and just park a bus still a 52 thrashing i won the league scoring over 100 goals i conceded more than the relegated teams 70 despite brilliant fitness coaches i was losing to loads of last minute goals why god why i love this game and always will but to get most enjoyment ill wait until the patch

update 3182015 logged in to try the update for a while and had this experience spent hours refining tactics in preseason games getting everything just right spent a lot of time working on training regimens to make sure the historically injury prone have slightly less intense work outs spent hours working my scouts to death got near the start of the season and had some great transfers lined up to come in wanyama tielemans depay and a few other youngins a net spend sure but after negotiating hard deals for kaboul capoue and adebayor i was well within the transfer budget we are go for launch a few days after the deals were agreed but before the players came to terms what happens kaboul our 4 weeks capoue broken for 3 months in training the deals are off and i have not saved for hours i swear to god they made injuries a problem so you have to buy the editor ill need to see stellar reviews for any future version before i pay again what an absolute heartbreaking shame there used to be a game here update 1242015 i still dont recommend this game i do recommend this series nothing else compares to fm there isnt a single sports management simulation in all of video games that comes close to how well fm does what it idoes if you are a new player get fm14 itll be cheaper and you dont have to pay full price for fm15 to get up to date rosters search the community hub and google for player and team updates and how to install them again if you are on the fence get fm14 its super good original review ive averaged about 650700 hours in each years fm dating back to 2011 ill keep this short there are great improvements to this game i just wish i could get to them every game i start no matter the team no matter the training no matter the facilities within 2 months of day one half of my first team is injured this game is seriously broken right now if there are not major fixes i can consider my fm addiction cured

ive been playing football manager since 2005 this is without a doubt the most frustrating and unrealistic installment purely because of a buggy game simulation sit and watch the 3d matches being played and youll be impressed at some nice new animations but the game being played infront of you will make you want to put your fist through your monitor  strikers miss 90% of 1 on 1 chances  chances that should result in a goal often dont and come around far too often than in real life  defenders that wander all over the place and dont tackle  wingers that seem content to run into defenders rather than crosspass the ball even if a teammate is in tons of space that just names a few needs a patch a big one

played football manager since its inception in 84 on the zx spectrum this is one of the worst in the series for multiple reasons the devs seem to have the notion of more is constantly better whilst getting the fundamentals of the game which always stood it above the rest completely wrong i have thousands of hours in football manager games and never been compelled to write a negative review although playable is not great the series has gone downhill the last few years in my opinion

waste of time and money fundamentally they have done minor tweaks to minor components of the game and changed the interface but absolutely botched the matchday engine which makes the game almost unplayable despite implementing succesful tactics and qaulity players in defence conceeding from crosses 23 times a game is a regular occurence and seems to be the only means of scoring goals for the opposition and your own team in addition to this injuries occur on average about 12 times a game and it seems that a full strength starting 11 will always be unacheivable because half the squad is injured it is extremely frustrating and unstoppable i bought fm15 for an improvement of fm14 but what i got was a different interface and a circuss of a matchday engine where goals go in at an unrealistic rate and players are playing with bones made out of toothpicks breaking every time they pass a ball stick to 14 as i will really below average effort i hope to see an improvement with a later patch

after reading quite a few very negative reviews and some positive reviews i decided to stay dedicated to the football manager series and buy this next installment after having played 09 10 11 12 13 and 14 i was not disappointed fm15 offers quite a bit of changes everything from the 3d matches to the interface gameplay and responsiveness first off the responsiveness of the game has greatly increased and improved the game is far more responsive than earlier versions and seems to go easier on the processor second interface the interface has been changed drastically anyone who has played the previous fm installments will have a hard time at first with getting to grips with this new interface but the change is definitely for the better it is far more intuitive and works far better for newer players  and it might take a while to get accustomed to it but once you do you realize exactly how much of a fabulous and welcome change it is it makes the game navigation far easier smoother and smarter  which in addition to the games responsiveness makes for a very fluid gaming experience the 3d matches however are not to my liking the cartoonish graphics and unrealistic movement of the players reminds me more of fifa 95 than a modern game in my eyes this is a step back from fm14 in fact and hinders the game somewhat as the players score unlikely and unrealistic goals sometimes or commit some extremely unrealistic movement and the entire feel of it is just awkward but now my last and most important point gameplay my god has this changed the whole game feels incredibly new the tactics screen is much easier to navigate through the inbox makes your life incredibly easy with interactions with playerstransfersalmost anything can be done directly from the inbox when prompted with a message about it transfers are far more realistic negotiations about contracts too player interactions have seen a major improvement as have interviews with the press and team talks heck even the backroom advice is better the entire interactionconversation section is much easier to navigate through works far better and more fluildy and seems to have a much greater impact on the game players seem to interact better and more often and their interactions have real positive or negative effects on your team and the game and thats absolutely fantastic its one of the major things that has been missing proper interactions many people have stated that the game is unrealistic that they lose all the time or get injured all the time  and i have one thing to say review your tactics the game is not broken ive been playing for a while now with arsenal the most injury stricken team ever and ive only had two injuries so far both of them under three weeks out for the players  and the players are extremely susceptible to injuries jack wilshere and gibbs so its understandable the scores have been realistic so far as far as im concerned and from what i can tell the problems people have been having directly link to their inability to adapt to the new game interface and inability to create proper tactics the only real thing that bothers me about this game however is the fact that the current ability and potential ability ratings for players seems to have decreased extremely from fm14 for some odd reason and in some places its truly uncalled for i mean for example how can it be that alexis sanchezs current ability is only 165 when hes clearly having a much better season than for example sergio aguero whose current ability is around 180 thats just ludicrous but lets be real im happy that this is the only bad thing i can say about this game and the 3d part i mean thats the least of our worries eventually the football manager series heavily relies on tactics not on individuals and thats what makes it great and thats also what makes this flaw really minor i highly recommend this game and see it as a step in the right direction for si

dont get me wrong i love football manager the layout is great and everything runs smoother than previous iterations that is great as i always felt it was a minor problem however why in seven hells is every decent youth player worth from 200k to around 2 million but when you try to purchase them for maybe 3 million 4 million the club asks for something ridiculous upwards of 25 million seriously the best i can do is constantly buy old players who wont be ridiculously over priced timo werner for example i can buy lionel messi for just under his jaw dropping price tag of 62 million lets be realistic here abromovich would be laughing if mourinho wanted that player and was asking him for that amount of money seriously this is meant to be the most realistic football management simulation sort it out please oh and just as a final note i really dont find it realistic if 7 of my first team get injured in a single match for 5 months each does anyone know when the next update is

this is a beta review however it would be unrealistic to expect much to change in the space of a week or 2 prior to actual release tldr doesnt really have much to recommend it over previous iterations technical this game is number crunching heavy yet the developers continue to take the approach of resisting the implementation of any sort of 64x option that would allow people to make fuller use of their hardware which would result in a more immersive experience as it would be viable to run more data at a faster speed it really is just exactly the same stuff as last year wrapped in a different skin between matches gameplay the ui takes a bit of getting used to but isnt that bad once you have played for a while a couple of screens such as the headlines screen sports a facemelting array of bright conflicting colours which could have been designed more tastefully player acquisition has been tightened up but not in a good way it is now very difficult at lower levels to find players outside the nation you are operating in and 100% of the time they will be unwilling to sign for you you can hold a discussion with them to try to convince them otherwise but even when you get a seemingly positive response they still refuse to negotiate there are some rpg elements that allow you to increase your characters attributes by taking coaching courses however there are instances of the board agreeing to a coaching course then it simply doesnt happen with no notifications given basically a lot of these newer features are pretty buggy theres also a lot of nonsense around player interaction as usual such as players wanting to leave you transfer list them no one comes in you offer them mutual termination remember they have asked to leave and they get highly offended and take a hissy fit press conferences are another bugbear with this edition of fm they quickly become repetitive and tedious as usual and before long you will find yourself having to answer more press conferences and more questions than ever as you are now accosted in the match tunnel before and after games in addition to pre and post match conferences while you can assign your assistant to pick this responsibility up its usually not a good idea as they trend towards controversial and team morale destroying options matches there are a few neat touches that improve the look and feel of stadiums you will also occasionally see things like banners with your team name on them if you reach cup finals etc goalkeepers are incredibly broken to the point that you might as well have a traffic cone in goal it looks as though they are trying to pull off some sort of 90 minute comedy routine given their inaction to prevent any sort of goal attempts a lot of games end up looking like rugby scorelines simply due to the terrible goalkeeping ai expect results such as 64 very regularly the goalkeepers are not helped by the ongoing issue from fm14 of defenders standing around and ballwatching this every few games means that when passbacks occur both defender and goalkeeper stand still while an opposition attacker will stroll from the middle of the field past your defender and knock it in past your inert goalkeeper players will also skate move without animation and occasionally perform bizzarre and immersion breaking animations such as tumbling over a few times on the spot when falling which makes for some strange viewing bluntly the match engine is a complete shambles community as always most of the players who play this game are great and there isnt really the sniping and animosity that you get from most game communities the community management itself however is an absolute disgrace with a clique of white knight moderators censoring and deleting any kind of criticism towards the game this gives the impression that si are extremely arrogant and disinterested in their customers if you pick this game up unless you enjoy brown nosing it is adviseable to stay well clear of fms official forums

this has to be this worst fm for a long time i cant seem to get into it like the others and match engine doesnt seem as good ive no idea why the devs felt the need to change the match engine again because they changed it in fm 14 and that was bugged on release as well but alot better than in this version when players are running with the ball its as though they are running in thick mud cos they are so slow goalkeepers are broken they cant seem to save anything the ui is bad as well no idea why they felt the need to change it selecting your team line up now requires more clicks and takes longer cos of the changes i really hope the devs fix the issues but overall this game is a disappointment over previous fm games

very disappointed with this years game lots of screens have been changed and they are now harder to navigate and make the changes you need that before  seems like a bad change to me a few of my grievances the squad selection screen you now cant left click on a substitute to chose who to swap them with you cant create custom views for the opposition instructions screen  why who thought that was a good idea im also not really a fan of the new match engine but i cant put my finger on what i dont like is it too bright choppy even with graphics levels set low sigh on the whole i wish i hadnt bought it

do not buy this game check my games list you will see that i once loved fm games not anymore and never again will i buy one this is the type of unfinished game that steam need to ban from being sold certain key components dont even work at all a small example is that there are no penalties from handballs right now the game fails in every way it could the me is a poor imitation of a crossing and set pieces simulator not a football simulator it is worse than the last three years versions upon release and i can assure you that they all had bugs and issues not this many or this bad if you really need more just go to the forums and read not many that will claim this game is anywhere near in a playable state maybe in 78 months from the time i write this si will have released a patch that makes it something like a game oh if that wasnt enough beware si and sega are not cooperating and are in fact sending customers with issues back and forth between them not me but check forum if you care also be aware that si are deleting the vast majority of negative posts claiming it will affect the way our customers play the game which is of course true they wouldnt play it because they would know whats wrong with it

agree with others here very inbalanced no matter what i do i leak in goals like my goal is ten time sbigger than the opponents just no fun in this game at all score lines are out of control just horrid on so many levels i really do hope they fix this quick and yes you could have a player with a 18 pace and see someone with pace of 9 catch them with no effort at all

i wouldnt recommend buying this game until a few patches are released the release version is full of bugs especially the match engine that makes it almost unplayable i mean sure you can play it but you just have to cringe at all the goals scored from obvious match engine bugs at this point 50% of goals are scored from crosses on the wing that your defenders just dont contest 30% scored from set pieces 10% scored on missplaced backpasses to the keeper and 10% for the rest the defense and goalie are so terrible most matches end with 4 goals scored if you want to win just make sure you have wingers who like to hug the touchline and cross the ball instead of cutting inside should have expected it really it is the first time i buy fm right on the release date

well well where do i start upon reading reviews of this game largely negative i was very cautious on purchasing this but i still did as i love fm ill start with the positives i like the new interface it makes it much easier as everything is in front of you in one screen rather that lots of dropdown menus having to be opened it also looks alot smoother and i like having world news opened up in a tab after skipping a day which means i wouldnt have to subscribe to other teams and leagues or some players negatives hold your breath because this could be a long one depending on how much i want to type i have played three competitive matches with my team oxford united and here are the scorlines 42 burton w 15 wolves l 63 mansfield l thats 8 goals scored and 13 goals conceded in three games outraged enough as it is i saw lots of people reporting situations like a large amount of injuries the highscoring games players with apparent mental and physical disabilities too many own goals well in those 3 games i had expereinced all of these things during the match against mansfield alone i had an injury my 6th in total including the 2 i started with my right back halting midrun unchallenged then leaving an opposition player to score 1 on 1 and then two own goals just to add to my misery who knows i may just be getting all the rubbish out of the way early and the remainder of my entire fm15 career with be rage free yeah sure good luck with that son but in my honest opinion do not buy this game if you are capable to rage and wait until it is cheaperthere has been a patch which sorts this out come on guys wake up this is poor if the inmatch experience is improved then this would be a good game and i will go back to my usual fm addictive binge playing until the early hours of the morning but i will not be playing until there is this patch whenever that is

applies only for the linux port of fm2015  i really loved football manager series i am not going to expalin what they are or how to play them i am really happy they tried to bring it to linux but they have failed the game freezes constantly sometimes when you click continue sometimes when you try to offer a contract to someone when it freezes there is no solution  you have to kill the process crashingfreezing like this 3 or more times per game week is simply unacceptable and completely ruined gameplay for me the freezing issue is quite common on their forums but there is no constructive response whatsoever i am disappointed with the linux port of the game and dont recommend anyone buying into frustrations like this  ubuntu 1404 most popular distribution with a good radeon driver on which everything seems to run just fine

its decent installment again but nothing much is new i paid 35 bucks for this and just upgraded from the beta to the full game and i dont notice a single difference everything still is as shady as in the beta  this just wont stand it means theyve probably had this game ready for ages since the changes are just graphical mostly and want to hussle us as much as they can of course the engine  card  injury system is messed up on launch as usual too ffs why do i keep falling for their scummy tricks i cant recommend anyone buying this now get it for 1520 bucks and after a few patches and maybe then its a decent update had to choose thumbsdown until the state of the game changes then my review might change too edit just got a crash dump error for the second time as well im done with this till they patch it back to fm14 it is sigh  edit 2 the only thing fixed are the crash dumps i no longer get crashes but the match engine is still so random and terrible that i dont even want to play no more edit 3 20122014 almost winter and this game is still a mess you can lose to the number 18 of the league with your best eleven and then 3 days later win against a stronger opponent with your bsquad for no reason at all si should be ashamed of themselves

this franchise had been in decline for a few years now fm14 had absolutely terrible defending and the problem still isnt gone this is especially clear in lower leagues where its rare to have a game without at least 4 goals the match engine does look and work better in most aspects than last year but at the end of the day the scorelines are still ridiculously unrealistic the 3d engine is still extremely bad graphically but whatever 2d classic is the way to go i mean it would be if not for the unrealistic results i havent played a really good fm in years and this is not one either

im a fifa manager guy however as it has been discontinued i had to move to football manager a friend taught me the ropes and ive been playing for a while i played with liverpool ac milan bayer leverkusen and atltico madrid no game has gone to midseason i studied researched and spent a lot of time talking with friends about this game i wish i hadnt this is just the worst manager game ive ever played for a simple reason nothing you do matters i bought marco reus and alex oxdalechamberlain to play on the wings might as well have kept the money for myself and used emile heskey and djimi traor there the most skilled player cannot dribble past the worst defender the best crosser of the ball cannot beat the first man the tallest and best header cannot score 3 goals a season from crosses every team play the exact same way and most goals come from the same three things shots from outside the box defensive mistakes and freekicks in upwards of 300 hours spent in the game i dont think i saw a single goal from a corner however three times i saw a goalkeeper handle the ball outside the box and get booked and two of those freekicks resulted in goals players are so unbelievably stupid that its annoying steven gerrard to take a free kick on the edge of the box you think hes going for goal no hes going to pass it back to the left back who will then try to dribble and lose it you think asmir begovic is a good goalkeeper well hes not above handling the ball outside of the box when trying to boot it upfield id always been told that football manager was all about the tactics and that it is the hardest thing to manage well it is hard specially because no matter how you set your team up to play they will always play the same way you can try to get the best passers of the game but they will misplace at least 30% of their 6 yard passes this is so frustrating im at a loss for words injuries well hows this for a list before the third match of the season i had the following players injured steven gerrard jordan henderson alex oxdalechamberlain alberto moreno john flanagan marco reus adam lallana daniel sturridge asmir begovic and mario balotelli thats before the third match all of those players bar lallana and reus who are injured at the start of the season got injured during pre season seriously unless this game is heavily patched to fix everything thats not just wrong but plain dumb ill be forced to stop playing a genre i really enjoy because ea were not competent enough to keep fifa manager going and because sega apparently have no clue what a football match looks like ill wait and see but i will not hope for much

people often send me messages asking why i am playing this game so i thought i would post a review to explain why i will first point out that i have a strong interest in football i wouldnt say i watch the matches but i am always reading news stories online and am up to speed with the majority of world football headlines i will also say i am not a massive fan of the fifa series of games produced by ea they seem to have a very immature audience whenever i have tried to play them online and that is something which puts me of immediately football manager the series puts you in the office of a football manager shocker huh you take on all the jobs that a football manager does from setting up tactics to training sessions all the way to signing new players for your team personally i find myself getting very immersed in this game there is something really special about taking a team from one of the lower leagues all the way up to being the best team in the world once you pass the first couple of seasons the players which are around today all start to retire move onto different teams etc this is when the game really begins the game will create computer generated random players these are called regens how good these regens are depends on a number of things but mostly the training and youth facilities you have at your club there is nothing more satisfying in the this game than finding a young 17 year old unknown kid and training and developing him into a worldclass footballer people may laugh or snarf at this game but if you enjoy football and want to find yourself a massive addictive time sync then football manager is the game for you

instead of getting the core of the game right tactics match engine we get yet another load of new press interactions that nobody cares about and even more dumb talks with players and teams sure you can get your assistants to do it but some players actually likes talkes to press and staff as long as its not repetitive and actually has an impact nevertheless the real problem is with the match engine results like 3 to 5 or 4 to 4 are common the goalkeeper stays on his line for every cross and the movements the players make in the engine are laughable the crowd looks like a bunch of inflatable dolls in the stand and just like previous x versions there is hardly any atmosphere in terms of sound from the crowds where have the good old sack the boss chants gone or why cant the crowd whistle or boo at the ref for that crippled engine we get the amazing gift of hot dog stands outside the stadium wow thanks for getting your priorities straight si last time i bought the game since 9899 time for a decent competitor

thank god i only paid 5 for this prasie the lord for gifts cards when playing fm13 i thought that these games were head and shoulders above any other football game in terms of the imersiveness and the elevel of realism but the last two games since then have been truly discusting i dont care about the graphics thats not what the game is about but the actual realism of the match engine is poor what is going on with the goalkeepers this year about 1015 of my conceded goals have come directly from rebounds from frankly rediculous saves from the keep he will just parry the ball away from the most tame shot imaginable and stand there for about a year until the follow up from the opposition striker rolls it in then he dives injuries are something which many people are complaining about i dont feel like my tactical changes have any efect on the game match stats mean nothing this is a real shame because i have a lot of time for si but im losing faith by the day i feel like some things happen on the game just to make you more addicted becasue lets be honest its more addictive when your not winnimg because you cant put the game down until you have sorted it and why do you have a sudden drop in form ever jan or feb every team has a bad patch but i aloong with many other players have unexplained drops in form where nothing you do can halt the slide i could go on for hours but i cant be bothered to give anymore feed back because i dont think it makes any differenc so if this review does nothing more than let me take my anger out on it then so be it

i cant recommend this in its current state too many injuries and a poor match engine with either unlikely goals or very lopsided results or where you can have all the best players be accomplished in all your tatics and have 100% motivation and still lose to the same team because the match engine decides you have to lose even though you have better possession attack and a whole bunch of players i had one game where the opposition went in and stoked it up and i had 9 injuries as a result with the opposition having no yellow cards the match engine seems not to reward those who attempt to play possession based soccer and it seems a case of just learning the same couple of tatics and rotating them or changing from control to attacking and you can win way too easily unless the game refuses to let you win against one team buying and selling players well a lot of the decent youth players the opposition wants in excess of 90 million pounds for went back to 2012 and had more fun then i did with fm15 after one season on 15 im out mabye after feb it will be better but for now i cant be stuffed

like every previous football manager games i preordered fm15 just to play beta i have to say this year there are way more bugs then every other years i played 50 hours in the first 3 days of the release of the beta version and i spotted about 10 problems because this is my favourite game i just keep playing and identify bugs in the bugs forum so my favourite game can be fixed yet i waited after two updates the game is still not fixed bugs that are still not fixed  after stadium expansion plan got cancelled the finishing date still highlight on the calendar  rooney get unhappy because pre season training start too early even though it is nearly december  defenders with at least 15 pace and 15 acceleration chase down the ball that has passed the defenders line ridiculously slow this is the most frustrating bug how can phil jones or jonny evans or rafael chase down a ball so so so slow it is pretty much slower than others walking the opponent end up getting ball easily since the defenders cant even get the ball with 50 metres head start throughout the 3 seasons ive seen this occurred 20 times so im quitting until it is fixed  setpiece marking is completely broken i set pretty much all my players to defend 3 form wall and 7 markers against 5 opponent yet 3 out of 5 opponents are completely unmarked and freely roaming around on the side of my wall  team selection layout maybe a minor issue but it can be annoying if you have a big squad or you want to pick someone in the youth team there used to be a sub slots column next to starting formationline up now it it gone you now have to drag a player from the players list to the substitute slots on the same list picking substitute has never been harder in my life  budget adjustment in my first season at manutd i can adjust the transfer budget to zero so i can have 36 mil per week for wage budget the second season i adjust it all the way to wage budget but i can only get 3 mil per week wage budget so that means my minimum transfer budget is 60 mil im paying players 3 mil wage per week so whats the point of having maximum 3 mil for wage budget and 60 mil for transfer budget why cant i have all my transfer budget all my wage budget  there are many more i have posted all the bugs ive spotted on the bugs forum but all i get is pissy tone replies or thread closed for lacking evidence they expect me to download this thing so i can post the game file on the server for them and ive try installing it on my mac countless of time it failed to install not to mention it is sponsored by mackeeper a freaking mac virus i tried to posted screenshot on the forum it never works they recommended this other software which has 2 weeks trial for free do i have to pay to help them identify the bugs i tried upload so videos of the bugs so my thread doesnt get close down and i get all these pissy replies since there server doesnt work i upload the game file on a file hosting website they still expect me to upload it on a server that never works on my mac mostly unappreciated replies when im trying to help them occasionally i get a nice reply but i am very unhappy with the game i save up my pocket money to preorder it paypal converted the money to profit them i got charged by banks with overdrawn fee and i get a game full of rubbish

at first i thought this game was a massive step up on fm 14 but after playing for only a few hours i have realised what a massive dissapointment this game really is i knoiw itss only beta but so many things need changing that i cant see the end products as being that good first of all injuries are outragious you are guaranteed to get an injury a game and can find yourself without you key players only 4 games in to the season second problem is the new match engine the amount of times my players have just stood there and watched charlie adams ping a 50 yard screamer in whilst my keeper does nothing is ridiculos seriously though the ai rarely do anyting the transfers are so unrealistic the value of a player might be 10 million but you will end up having to pay 40 million for a decent player finally the worst part is the inconsistency of the matches you can go and play manchester city away and thrash the 60 and then lose at home to west brom 40 this was a problem in early fm 14 and that got soon fixed im not saying you should win every game but the game feels too inconsistant there isnt enough realism in matches i have been looking forward to fm 15 for a while now and am quite dissapointed so far at this stage tbh i wouldt recommend fm 15 untill things have been changed people are rating this game because i told my player i was gonnna sell him and he got upset that has been in fm for an age and isnt a real addition there are positives of this game but not enough

i see some improvements in the graphics i have tried the game four times now and had 39 injuries which is quite unrealistic also you drill a counter tactics and never ever display transitions where you catch the opponent off balance i have been a coach for many years and to actually see the tactics trained expressed in the graphics well it aint happening thus the game lacks realism or ability to convert programming into challenging gameplay

i love the game very much however there are always some concerns these are all game play issues 1 a few players ratings messi is 20 everything as usual but he didnt have a great last season like he usualy does some players are quite underrated such as di maria and a few atletico madrid players ronaldo has 15 acceleration not sure how that works 2 some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainablenot sure if its a bug or not sometimes the defenders just headspass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it 3 when players dribble they run into teamates far too often which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life 4 this is a very irritating one players misses 1v1s far too much if they have 45 1v1 chances theyll manage to score one this is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply dont miss all those chances you could say that they are having a bad game but its happening consistantly throughout the season also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance but our players just blast it strait at their keepers 5 final one so far players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target so far i havnt seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition please could you fix these issues i would be forever greatful

truly a horrible game to play the game engine match engine and what is referred to as the ai actually just a randomisation engine based on mathematical equation is defective the players do not have any realistic actions or movements the defensive simply does not work especially crossballs which is impossible to defend against your central defenders will try crossballs from deep regardsless of their shortt passing and less risky passing your team will miss 45 clear cut chances every match the opponent goalkeeper will always play high above level and your opponents players are always faster then yours there has been so much focus on the administrative part of the game that the actual playing a match part of the game has been overlooked and as for the administrative part it is boring and doll constant and repeating media questions before and after every single match makes one set of the assistant manager to handle it individual traning for players is gone completely in order to facilitate new players basically making the game easier to the point of being dumb and this is in normal mode they originally made the fm classic mode for that purpose there are a few positives like the new scouting system and staff system and the ui has been improved as well but those things are easily forgotten in the face of the overwhelming onslaught of errors and lazy programming all in all it is hard to see how this game got through testing just kidding sigames never test their games before release and they do not care about correcting errors and flaws most of what i have written was reported doing the beta fase of the game but nothing was done about it the beta was version 151 and the game is now on 1513 so 3 versions later and nothing has changed my advice do not buy this game it is defective and it is unlikely that it will ever be fixed it reminds of fm2005 and fm2013 they were defective from the beginning and it was never fixed ps the metascore is faked there are always equal number of positive reviews to the negative ones and they always give equal opposite score

in every game 13 player gets injured this game kicks your nut sacks as long till you want to play a totally different game long winning streaks followed by long losing streaks even the league bottom dwellers hits you with 60 too many goals 45 on average horrible execution tackles inside penalty areas almost never leads to a penalty shot but penalties come from errors which you cannot even see fm15beta is faulty as hell good job si ok this is beta but it has to be a totally different game on next friday when the official release date is best goal  my goalie was called by referee goalie walked there and received an yellow card then my goalie started jogging towards his work place and meanwhile the opponent gave their corner kick and scored an empty netter rather play fm13 beyond earth and this prepurchased and regret both never again a prepurchase not even one

this game is the worst football manager so far the steam engine is very poor and i cant contact steam support to help me with any of my issues i uninstalled the game and tried to reinstall it but it says its already purchased so i cant even see if that works the maintenance on the game is shocking the previous games have never been this bad i will strongly consider never going near steam ever again after this shambles id recommend everyone stay away from this game if you have no time for terrible help and no maintenance

i want to play this game i like fantasy games but everytime i start it up i remember that half my team will be injured within the first 3 months that no matter what i do consistency is not possible and my team will fail to perform and i will fail to have any real impact on that despite the rediculas sometimes over lapping micromanaging aspects that are both too specific and too general example exploit the flanks doesnt mean exploit the flanks more it means only exploit the flanks unless you select other options in which that ratio cant be controlled example you can have multiple coaches for multiple traits and skills but can only have one practice type per day you can try to teach a player a new move or position and its up to the player if hes compatable let alone compitent you will train and trade and chances are players wont want to come to your club in which case the conversational options are minimal repetative and nonimpactful oh and did i mention that some of the user interface is completely bugged and i mean completely try organizing your custom view and watch as some of your options do not appear you want to sort by position sure wait then why does it sort by ability when i click position to suggest this game would be to encourage this type of lack luster game developing that is become the norm im not saying you cant make money but just publish a game every other year and charge us 100$ for something you can be proud of instead of dusting off and polishing the same game with improved data

before the fan boys and girls scream and shout at me for not recommending this game please note i love the game however not much has changed in the last few years and this is another rearranged database update with a spit and polished 3d engine which is still lacking a lot of work that said if you are a fan of fm you probably already bought it like i did because you have done every year since the day dot and will do every year regardless so if you are new to this its going to look great if you are an older fm player then yes its another database update with a sidebar

love the series but this is only adding to the manner in which fms match engines are getting worse and worse in my onw opinion the series has been in huge decline since 2012 and this is absolutely no exception own goals here own goals there 5 goals here 10 goals there goalkeepers ha until si fix the match engine  something that im doubting will actually happen after the way that the fm14 engine was awful throughout  dont purchase this find 2012 online somewhere and play the last game in the series that i can say was a really enjoyable game

ive played every fm and champ manager before they split and while some have set the bar low and some have had glitches this is by far the worst both single and multiplayer games seem to have the worst ai ive ever seen passes going off in random directions at least 1015 times per match and every match win lose or draw in multiplayer having at least 68 goals i preordered and am really dissapointed that i did i expect subsequent patches to vastly improve the quality of the gameplay but in the meantime id have to say dont buy this until its fixed we have given up our usual multiplayer game because it is almost unplayable

as of right now i have to give this version a bad review first time ever giving fm a bad one playing in my second season and for 2 seasons in a row i have had more than half my team injured i tried everything from reducing training to even minimal training i wouldnt buy this game unless it goes up for atleast 50% off

i dont know what people are crying about i havent noticed any problems with the injuries and ive started several saves both in top and bottom tier football overall this is by far the best football manager thats released to date althought theres still a few bugs here and there like theres pretty much every year by the january update the game will most likely be pretty much a bug free which is when most people buy the game anyway the new match engine is very promising and i think its already better than in the previous versions the new touchline team talks also seems to be working pretty well and the add another dimension to the game the new scouting system is also superior compared to the previous versions and then the new ui its again way better than before and having the side panel back just makes its so much easier to navigate through the menus so overall i think its the best football manager game to date although it still have a few bugs here and there if you are a fan of the football manager franchise then this is definitely a must buy remember that the christmas sales are coming soon so its probably worth waiting till then if you havent got the game already by now and this was written by someone who spents 10001500 hours with football manager each year and i own each and every game of the serie including quite a few versions of cm too

bought fm since 06 and have to say this feels more like an arcade version the new ui is awful and getting used to things again is time wasting why try fix something that wasnt broke theres a reason we went from side bar to top bar in previous versions of fm the option to change from side bar to top bar isnt there either last buy of fm for me i think

have been playing fm since 2012 so i am no way a newbie to this game my 2 cents so far 1 too many bugs in match engine laggy lousy ui gameplay is not realistic at all amount of long shots unrealistic angles number of goals ball physics everything is a big letdown 2 add to that licensing issues fm should state in bold that fm 2015 does not have licence for players faces team logosjerseys  this was shambolic and adds one more level of unrealism i could go on rambling about it  in short fm 2015 disappoints me every level practically a downgrade from fm 2014

issue for me these days with fm is the staleness of the whole experience there are things wrong with the match engine as others have pointed out but the whole series has emphasised width over depth since it moved from being cm to fm  ive been playing since domark versions on the amiga i remember when we only had text based commentary and the tension was incredible there was the feeling of just being given enough information and let your imagination fill in the gaps fm2015 in particular gives you so many features it can initially feel overwhelming until that is you realise it doesnt really matter keep your players happy make sure your tactics are reasonably sane gradually improve your squad and well thats it obviously you can complicate that as much as you like if thats what you want but the whole game experience is totally flat now every iteration just adds a couple more features that arent really fleshed out much on top of a bunch of features from previous iterations that havent been developed further once they have been introduced all we seem to really pay 40 assuming you buy on release for is a data update and a quick polish  it makes no difference if the dev team have put thousands of hours into each version if the endusers experience is so stale  its lost sight of the enduser experience and thats what hurts so much the adding of ingame purchases is also a massive turnoff for me and others who have given up on fm sooner than i inevitably will seriously micropayment to increase your clubs bank balance buy editor access purchase no transfer restrictions whose idea was this its awful

overall this year was a disappointment for me first i dont like the dark skin but well its just my taste injuries everyone mentions about it i think its not just the number of players injured which is the problem the problem is the duration of those injuries while playing with corinthians at some point i had 7 players out for 56 months with broken legs all happened during matches and i play this game at a good level for 6 years i know how to reduce them it is just broken players are just  just 3 weeks after some jackass signs a new contract he becomes unhappy with his contract and asking for a new one if a player is playing well he becomes unhappy in any case he wants more salary a new challenge or is flattered by interest of a bigger club player is on international duty for 40 days and he becomes unhappy for not being in the first team same goes with injured players i have a squad of 24 players 21 of them are on international duty and i have a semi final match game is simply absurdly ed up you cant make any alterations on your fixture you cant interact with the fa or your club board for most cases after all i could write down a 50page list on things that are  in the game i wont i just want to tell everyone who considers buying the game i feel like they intentionally made it so  so that we will be forced to buy the ingame editor there is no way you can play this game unless you buy the ingame editor keep it in mind

beta review pre update stikers scored way too many goals so they sorted that out in the latest update by making them useless players ignore instructions yet again eg long balls when only short passing is selected referees are way to card happy when instructions are to tackle lightly far too many injuries i had a light training regime and had 9 players 6 of which are first team regulars with high natural fitness out before the season even started i keep hoping they will sort out some issues but apparently theres nothing ever wrong with the match engine all hail the indisputable match engine in all of its reichous goodness or face death by the deluded fanboys recyling the old its your tactics hur durrrrr it feels like they want the game to be more challenging in places to the point where it boxes up realism and puts it to the back of the wardrobe not to be seen again for the next few years i really hoped they wouldve improved on last years version and even the year before and in some respects they have more detailed player interactions better animations and the whole stat thing for your manager so you dont have to bother to look for a coach in one area but these few nice things do not compensate for a yet again bad version fullgame review the same injury problems are still occuring 7 first team players injured 5 over a month 3 over 4 months still loads of cards but very few of them for opposition players who can hack your players down as much as they like without the slightest bit of a telling off and players ai seems to have regressed in places ive noticed the ball rolling past one of my wingers intended for someone else but wouldnt have the slightest chance of getting it my winger couldve easily got it but instead watched the opposition walk over and take possession fullbacks marking is horrendous to the point where you may as well have none because they just let everyone have 10 yards of space to run past them and still lots of shooting from outside the box even though relevant tactical instructions tell them to work the ball into the box but i guess what si really meant by that was shoot from whereever as long as you get the ball into the box also some players stats are way out for how they play in real life and seem to only be that way because they play for certain teams

im a big fan of fm games but last few years seems your main enemy is injuries this version ive been getting 12 a game they start to add up also why do so many games have huge scorelines like its the norm now i dont lose often but when i do its by 45 goals this seriously needs sorted out because im not playing till this and injuries are fixed i appreciate alot of stuff like updating stats every year that people dont realize how long it takes but still these are fundamentals that can break the whole experience like i said i do love these games but its just not worth it this year nothing new that makes it worth another purchase i prefer to use 2014 and get updates for it

another version pretty much the same as the others but upgraded more animations and moreanimations more features as well apparently but well get to that soon i was excited for fm 2015 as i normally am whenever a new version comes out i start up a save where im unemployed with a sunday league reputation this time i have to think about the coaching badges as well i dont want any i will start at the very bottom then i experience some rpg attribute thingy am i a tracksuit manager or a tactical manager hell if i know i am both but according to the game i kind of have to choose one or the other i like the idea but i find it a bit too gimmicky loading up every single league the game comes with and a large database takes me about 15 minutes before i can start playing for real the game progresses smoothly no problems being over the recommended player limit yet im in the year 2025 now and still no problem granted it slows down a bit when changing months changing year and during transfer deadline days but i expected that playing the game itself is a bit like a tiny rollercoaster ride i love playing the game but there are so many tiny bugs and features that dont work very well sidebar i dont mind it but it gives me less room for customised screens while on the subject customised screens a complete mess i warned them about these kind of things on sis forums small tiny bugs like these might seems small but they will come back and be a bigger issue its been there for a long long time and they havent done anything about it it wasnt prioritised and now theyre struggling to figure out how to fix it go figure customising screens is a nightmare columns disappearing left and right when you have plenty of room on the screen you just want to adjust the width of one column a few mm poof an entire column or two gone very annoying as i customise most of my screens player interactions are just a complete mess and do not work properly an entire team in outrage because a 17year old who wouldnt get anywhere near the bench of my local 10thtier reallife club amazing nobody would care not even the 17year old himself players complaining that they want to play more games we are in the middle of the bleeding holidays we dont have another game for 3 months then comes back and wants to leave because i didnt keep my promise of playing him were still one and a half month away from our first friendly then when i try to sell him he complains that im trying to force him out of the club wellkind of yeah you wanted to leave becuase of playing time and me not keeping promises so now you want to leave because i was trying to let you leave because you wanted to player interactions is a big mess one big negative from me is tactics screen lord oh lord what have they done fm14 had the closetoperfect tactics screen and then they change it for no apparent reason change it to something a thousand times worse now to be fair they have updated the tactics screen with their patches so it looks a bit better to a new player i dont know what to say i personally dont like the tactics screen at all i simply dont use it backroom advice my coaches are still offering me contradicting advice why the hell would i want my left fullback dribble on the right hand side when you just told me to train him so he doesnt do that anymore i could write a whole lot more about the ups and downs with this game but ill just do this i do enjoy the game quite a bit but its not the best fm far away from it another notcomplete version of this game which i am getting a bit tired of it seems like its acceptable that this is always a game in progress it will always be in progress and i understand that but each released version should feel like a complete product it doesnt and it hasnt done that for a long time people on the forums wants features and more features on one hand they get applauded for doing so but when things arent working so well they get the defenders shouting theyre just a small company if theyre not so big then stop adding so many features stop adding more than they can handle which seems to be the case more and more each year more features doesnt equal better product it also needs to work properly which it doesnt this seems like an overly negative review and it kind of is but i have to say that i do enjoy this iteration as well ill still have probably over a thousand hours in this game when fm16 comes out having a lot of fun finding it harder personally than any other version but i love the challenge i do recommend this game make no mistake about that ill leave this review with the things that bothers me the most about this fm2015 cons  player interactions doesnt work properly  tactics screen x 1000 its just many steps back from what they had  issue with getting players match fit in lower leagues  too easy overacheiving when you have the right tactic compared to real life  scouting is very tedious and doesnt work properly  customising screens doesnt really work

great addition to the series despite a lot of negativity towards it the new interface is great and improves on last years version i do agree to an extent that injuries do get a bit ridiculous towards parts of the season  my most memorable being managing wolfsburg and having 7 regular starters injured all within a space of 23 months aside from this everything else has been great tactics have been spot on i also tested a few tactics from the workshop and i was surprised at how good some of them were  but it didnt make an instant difference some tactics took a good 510 games to start flowing nicely otherwise i would find myself conceding at least 2 goals per game this year i was focusing solely on gaining most of the achievements rather then spending my life going through season to season with my favourite team ive been an admirer of these games since championship manager 98 and think ive purchased it every year from then it is true that a lot of the updates could quite easily come into a nice dlc bundle or same game upgrade however this is not the case people should note that they are not forced to buy the game every year their are plenty of dedicated people within the football manager community that focus on updating the databases for older game titles in order for those to keep playing the old game with the new data overall i have loved fm15 and am pleased to say that after all these years sports interactive are still making good progress in providing a richer and more fulfilling football manager

i was really looking forward to the latest edition of football manager i have been buying them since 2007 this is easily the worst football manager for a long time the match engine underpins this there are a number of issues with it the first is the goals per game there have been numerous occasions where you will go into half time with a score at 33 or more an example of this was when i was playing as newcastle and in a game against liverpool i was 42 up at half time only to eventually loose the game 85 this seems to happen all the time the second is the goalkeepers i have seen some absolutely blinding saves where a goalkeeper will jump from one end of the goal all the way to the other and still hold the ball the next minute a shot from 30 yards will go right down his throat and he seems to jump out the way of it the goal kicks are often very strange i have often been in the situation where the keeper will simply pass it to the opposition striker who simply puts the ball in the net extremely frustrating as you can imagine in addition to this is if a goal keeper makes a save but doesnt hold onto the ball he seems to forget all about it your defenders will also have no interest in it the only person who is will be an opposition player who will run 45 yards for a simple tap in but it only ever seems to be against you it can be comical at times where the defenders are turning on the spot looking in all directions the goalkeeper wandering around the six yard box and a striker skipping through and tapping it in general mistakes with the engine involve every other position as well if youre thinking of getting this game dont wait until they fix it or steer clear for good

avoid football manager 2015 until it is fixed why too many goals conceded ridiculous crippling injuries too many goals from crosses  corners out of control player concerns okay let me start by saying im an huge fm fan ive owned every single copy since the days of its predecessor championship manager so were talking a decade and some therefore its not natural for me to hate on a game ive always loved however this game is awful i have deleted it from my computer and wont be playing it again until it has been patched i bought guardado a three star left mid for back up to tadic i gave him a backup squad member contract after three premier league matches where he came on as a sub in two he began moaning tadic then got injured for 6 months surprise surprise it took guardado 16 premier league matches as a starting player to get over it back up sqaud member i was southampton decent tophalf premier league side i conceded 86 goals in 38 premier league games i tried everything defensive fullbacks five at the back two defensive midfielders defensive setup rigid approach new defensive coaches etc etc etc nothing worked i thought maybe it was a bug with my game i restarted with southampton spent my entire transfer budget on my defense and yet again conceded 75 goals in a single premier league campaign avoid avoid avoid

the game is fine in the long term but the buggy match engine and the tons of injuries are so annoying my goalkeeper makes a great save and parries it you would think he would want to get that ball as soon as possible nope he takes forever to get up leaving the opposistion to just tap it in my wingers keep cutting inside then howling it into row z at least 5 times a match i have my highlights set to key so when i see memphis depay cut inside i get all pumped up and then nope he kicks it out of the stadium the injuries are also annoying sure its realistic but every pre season i end up with at least 5 key players getting injured before the opening match of the season it gets better as the season goes along and i know its because of low match fitness in pre season but its stupid this needs to be fixed there are some positives though the scouting and coaching is a lot better than in previous fms and the transfers are also realistic the only problem with the transfers is that all the youth players want the same deal and they wont budge at all unless i give them 20k a week i would recommend this game to a first time fm player but not if you have previous fms just stick to them and not buy this buggy game

having played many fm games over the years i didnt think that the match end could become more painful to watch seeing your own players move out of the way of the ball has been in the game for ages and its really time this kind of nonsense was fixed watching a match is like pulling teeth as your players walk to tackle move out of their way and let the opposition clean through on goal had this not cost 17 i would never have bought it because no fm game is worth 30 the game has become so bloated that it has forgotten its core values of what made fm such a great

i dont know why there is so much negative reviews out there the game is great and the new scouting is much more realistic now ive played this version since the beta 12 november and ive only encountered 3 crashes overall so dont worry too much about that new interface feels great just need to get used to it regarding the me there seem to be a lot of goal from crosses making a tactic with wingers like 451 maybe too rewarding ive already played 100hours in several top and bottom div and i havent noticed much irrealistics things happening you still get a few dumb keeperesdc mistakes but  happens irl as well so np the databases are up to date except for the french leagues because sadly french scouts are lazy but theres already a patch out there for ligue 1 and 2 so no worries overall pretty solid new opus i have 700 hours on most fm since fm2010 people need to stop crying when city chelsea the psg etc are buying wonderkids for 20millions because thats whats happening irl duh

having played every version of football manager back to the heydays of championship manager on the amiga purchasing every year without regret as i always get my moneys worth they changed the layout for the better this year and did the usual tweaks and as ever it has took a few patches but the game plays as well as ever highlight for me has been the scouting tweak made me think how best to get the info i need on players and as in real life the best way is to watch them and also have they come in on trial its a small thing but that is what makes football manager worthy of purchase each year all the small thngs that make one great thing off to don the sheepskin and see what dreams can be acheived

very buggy even simple things like modifying views dont work the interface is very badly constructed and confusing overall this is a giant step back from previous versions it doesnt add anything to the game except bugs no real inovation over years past save a little money and get a better version fm 2013 is pretty good 2013 is basically identical to 2015 except with fewer bugs and more cool community mods

let me start this by saying i have been playing fm games for a few years now and have thoroughly enjoyed them this is the first year that it has disappointed me so much that i actually tried to lobby to get my money back from steam rather than trust the patch system to right the ship steam obviously flat out refused to help me which i guess its written in the rules and steam lacks any sort of heart for its customers so that was a wasted effort my main irritation is the injuries it seems some of you experience the injury issue and some dont working with sounders fc within two friendlies and a league game i lost obafemi martins brad evans and pineda to injuries during the match 4 days later in what i put in as light training i lost chad barrett for 4 months and ozzie alonso for 3 months those injuries crippled my team for a grand total of 5 months all within the span of a week in my entire life of ever watching soccerfootball i have never ever seen this happen this is supposed to be the most realistic league simulator in all of gaming right well not anymore the other glaring issue is whicher agorathim they use for what i call the fair shake factor in my first friendly i had the seattle sounders with mostly starting level players going up against a regional team semi pro at best and i got smashed 4 to 1 sounders fc almost never get beat especially to teams from what i would consider a beer league team this is terrible they broke football manager 2015 as far as i can tell its not even fun

ive been playing football manager since 9798 game and feel this is probably the worst football manager yet the excessive amount of goals makes the game incredibly unrealistic injuries seem to happen mainly to key players and nobody else the revamped graphics is pretty disappointing and the new skin is harder to use i wish i had bought this as a cd so i could take it back to the shop the games of late have all had at least one small issue such as the amount of times players hit the post in fm2013 but this version seems to have more than ever

bought the game when i saw the 152 was out i really did think this would be a version were the most idiotic aspects of the match engine would be removed i guess im wrong so i started my game the last coach had ended his career with 5 wins streak so i felt pressured to win in the begin won 2 matches were my team was expected to tie so far so good then i started noticing it next match starts everythings fine my defender is about to get the ball know what happens he sundenly slows down and nearly stops walking enemy striker gets the ball and scores i tough it was a isolated mistake of the match engine so i continued next match my striker was running foward grabbed the ball man on man vs the keeper he stops running and 4 defenders reach him he can easily score from there does he shot no he tries to dribble the 4 defenders by going in the middle of them later i saw my striker running he had no chance to get the ball enemy defender did the wost pass i ever saw and fell into the ground for no real reason then started crying my striker had a chance in front of the goal man on man he kicks the ball slow and near the keeper and its in might be a bug thats when you start noticing every corner kick that is going to any player but a striker near the first post will go in works for both sides my defender did a hat trick with those corners striker had even more opportunities by the same way and didnt kick the ball enemy also scored like this between my defenders leg that is im not opening this game again until january updatei swear to god si should release fm at january instead of releasing it at november every year with the match engine sloppier and sloppier talking about tactics they dont matter much ive even tried telling my team to not leave their positions but every player seems to run in the area he wants to in this current state i would give this game a 510 mediocre

well for me it just isnt fun fm lost its fun for me from around fm10  ie it just became too realistic  i think i stopped at fm11 i came back for fm14 on sale and thought it was okay my main problem is that even by cheating you cant win unless you are lucky enough to figure out ongoing tactics  which is kind of tedious and a game killer for me so by using the ingame editor and magically transferring players like messi ronaldo bale ramos pique t silva vidal etc to man utd  dont expect to go play the next game and walk all over the opposition  in fact i gave up when i was being hammered 72 by aston villa  ive been replaying the aston villa game for hours to try to at least draw with them  its not fun opposing ai players have a frustrating ability to just seem faster and more skillful than any player your team has  so its like a player like ronaldo or messi play worse  basically aston villa are playing like they have inherited all of the skills of my team  like it is a glitchbug  aston villa can run up the wing and cross the ball and score nobody touches the ball the winger just runs up the touchline and fires the ball into the back of the net from the wing  they can even do that twice in a game aston villa are scoring astonishing world class goals messi ronaldo bale etc are struggling to play at sunday league level i will buy the fact that you have to somehow find a tactic that works  but how the hell does this affect ronaldos etc ability to run with the ball theres just no fun in magically transferring players to your team and they all of a sudden dont have a clue how to play football they react slower  to me it is like they are hindered by something yet its fair to say other people will claim that they could magically transfer great players to their team and just win 10  0 every game so for me the game is potentially only fun if you prefer the tactics of football and can work out the combinations long gone are the days of the older fms or cms when you literally could buy the best players in the world and just destroy everything in your path without too much thought about tactics i think i will struggle to continue playing this game because replaying aston villa for hours in reallife just to at least draw with them is kind of pointless

its football manager 2014 with a new skin or is it fm 2013 with the bugs ironed out i paid good money for 2015 and apart from a few gui tweaks and slightly improved match engine i can see not a lot a difference it looks to me like the developers have sat on their hands for 364 days and spend 1 day skinning the old 2014 and then releasing it no doubt like in 2014 we will have a number of bugs that are never ironed out how about penalty taking in 2014  the game would never continue i do not thing they have listened to the football manager community and released a hashed up version and then booked thier holidays for another year poor

hello i would like to say at the point of writting this review i had only had this game for the weekend free weekend game i avoided buying this game due to the reviews claiming injury problems and such on at first in my career i struggled to win my team let in goal after goal the good old we score 2 they score 3 scenario i made some changes to the coaching staff changed training and now my team is in the top four managing newcastle eith only one signing danny ings the game does have a few minor bugs and some of the layouts are very confusing and while the simulation of the football isnt perfect it has come a long way since 2013 my previous version of the game im going to snatch this up while its on sale for sure for those who struggle to begin with i reccomend start out a feeling career and then re start with the same club refining what you want the players to play like

first days play there is a lot of familiarity here and also a lot of new learnings the ui has been revamped giving more of a taskbar feel and for me not a bad layout at all i can get to more frequent places in game with one or two clicks now rather than 3 or 4 which is appreciated takes a little getting used to in finding your way around but that was expected im playing with england being playable and every other country viewable filters include all regions top league players coming it at about 130000 some nice new features include the touchline shouts which im still looking at the effects but generally seem to be working ok some tweaks with the scouting and man management options too which i like a lot the engine itself is different enough to distinguish itself from previous games yet isnt a true evolvement more upgrade than paradigm shift visuals have been upgraded all over i really like the tactic options feels more rounded now lots of nice shortcuts very happy with the purchase and looking forward to having long careers

be aware of the frustrating bugs in the match engine this makes the game unplayable at the moment therefore i recommend you wait and get this game around april to july 2015 hopefully when si fixes most of these issues hopefully in the near future fm 2015 will get more stable because for now i will be playing fm 2014  too many goals in matches  too many goals from corners  poor goalkeeping these are just one of the many bugs in the match engine which makes it unrealistic and unplayable however i will say that fm 2015 is an improvement from last year in terms of changes they have made the game more user friendly by making it easier for the user to achieve success in managing a club through tactics choosing the best squad etc

why dont i ever take notice of all the negative reviews i should have learned from 2013 and 2014 which i put hours into that without any competition for decent football manager games sports interactive were just going to polish a turd and throw it out as new i wont go into my injury count after 3 games as most people already make mention to the absurd number of injuries now granted i havent put a lot into this game well 30 of my hard earned cash was more than enough but do i really need to put any more time in than i have it is awful the same absolute crap they sold last year it looks a complete mess it plays like a complete mess and the old random effect seems to be back with regards to results this game is like taking two dice rolling them and giving scores to each team your tactics mean nothing your squad of players mean nothing you can say this review is based on only 12 hours of gameplay and youd be right but if you add that to the hours sunk into 2014 which is pretty much the same and the fact ive played football manager since its championship manager days i do not need to put more hours into seeing this game fall on its  over and over like the last 2 seasons the game has become over complicated to the point that instead of your knowledge of football being tested its your patience that this game tests with its absolute random results results like elche 3 barcelona 0 followed by barcelona 5 atletico 0 and we round off the 3 matches with barcelona 0 real madrid 7  er yeah the same players that got me a 50 win also lost to a nothing team by 3 and then destroyed by real madrid even if i had no tactical knowledge whatsoever in football barcelona shipping 10 goals in 2 games whilst scoring 5 in another is just absolute horse st in real life id have to put messi in goal and neymar on the bench to ship 10 as barca i do prefer to start in the lower leagues mind you however seeing those results i dont think i like the idea of being hammered 10 or 110 every game so stopped short of starting an actual longterm game i have no doubt there will be players saying you just dont know what youre doing to which ill just get in first with yes i do  saved you time typing your tired and ill informed response i have a very good knowledge of footballing tactics training regimes and how good a player should be in certain positions based on stats however this game does not reflect any of that i also know that too many new players can cause issues with morale and so forth i understand an over heavy training regime could effect the players performance i know that a 433 doesnt work in any top division i know that introducing new players slowly to the team is sometimes better than throwing them in with a 90 minute debut ive read tips pages ive read faqs ive been playing the series and its predecessor since 1992 and usually have a great time taking smaller clubs over and with time building them into bigger clubs

the games have been getting worse since 2012 this game is no fun to play at all and is incredibly frustrating as most people have mentioned its buggy the new menu system works for some things quick access to teams training etc but is terrible in others such as the team selection covered in colours and you have no idea how to even pick a team which results in a steep unnessesary learning curve then comes the matches almost every game goes one of 4 ways you scrape a windraw you dominate and go 23 goals up and end up loosing somehow you thump a team 3 or 40 or you get thumped yourself it doesnt seem to matter if your opposition is better or worse than you those are the outcomes mostly you will scrape a drawwin to make it worse you can thump a team better than you then get smashed by a team worse than you the next week the team talks are basically the same and as poor as the last couple of years but with an apparantly random outcome of mood in your players until you get repuation which frankly is impossible the same goes for press confrences which have mostly been poor and a time waster slowing the game down and having a completely unknown outcome now you have to deal with the press directly before or after a game slowing it further just give it to your assitant manager even though they will say crazy things like arsenal will win the league when your playing as tottenham it may boil down to having to choose you managerial type rpg style which is the worst idea they have ever had it feels like cheating by giving yourself the highest stats but that is the only way to stand a chance i dont want to think about my inner workings as a managerhead coach i just want to play the game it may also come down to learning how your interactions affect the game this to me is unrealistic and learing how to play a game isnt the same as becoming a better real life manager the one and only positive is the new scouting system where you need a good couple of weeksmonths to get a full picture of the players though you still need to make sure your scouts are half decent otherwise youll waste a lot of time and money its just annoyingly poor i havent even mentined the bugs as there well covered by other reviews ive played the game since the days of championship manager but this is terrible frustrating and worst of all its not fun dont waste your money

tldr decent management game but lacking innovation and spark worth a sale buy for football fans but nothing more as the lack of new features and stillbroken 3d match engine does not justify the full price tag detailed review in short fm15 is a decent game if only for lack of competition but is a weak entry into the series first off new features wellthere arent any really there is no true innovation that once made the series great and ive been playing since champ man 98 to directly quote the new and improved list on the box the new features are new user interface  which is done every year new scouting centre  which is a mild tweak of the scouting network more realistic player personalities  which is also done every year deeper media experience  which surprisingly gets tweaked every year too so what have i just paid for apparently an updated database a few tweaks and a new clunky ui just like last year i think this speaks volumes about the games development if the marketing team are highlighting these as the new and improved features putting aside new features or lack thereof ill discuss the actual features player personalities despite claims of being improved have regressed to the point of manic depression rampant in fm13 im getting transfer requests and complaints if players dont feature in every game regardless of form fitness or squad position i regularly play all of my senior players being an advocate of rotation to minimise fatigue and injury and i have regular players complain about lack of game time if they arent in the first 11 for as few as 2 or 3 games players also cannot take criticism or praise for that matter ive criticised players with below 610 ratings and had them say they played well and praised a 910 hat trick scoring player for him to say that he was disappointed that i thought hed played well personalities dont seem to count for anything all players seem to be volatile in my game with a 5050 chance of positive or negative reaction whether justified or not the match day experience hasnt changed much except you now get occasional tunnel interviews and can give pep talks from the touchline tunnel interviews happen at random points and play out in the exact same way as media interviews only you cannot seem to skip them or send the assistant it is tedious and repetitive however being able to give touchline pep talks is a great implementation allowing you praise or berate players as needed to spur them on further im not sure whether there is actually an effect or if it is just placebo but it is a nice inclusion the 3d match engine is unsurprisingly still broken but unlike last year where i could only really fault the defensive ai all aspects of ai is broken for both your team and the opponent missing open goals passing to the opposition letting loose balls run free for both scoring and conceding chances not marking poor movement even worse animations players completely ignoring instructions the list goes on these issues just lead to dull games whether winning or losing personally i think the 3d match engine needs to be scrapped entirely as si have consistently failed to fix widely criticised issues the workaround i have used since 2009 is to use the 2d engine giving reasonably realistic performances and scorelines and is still something i do in this installment out of match experience is incredibly enoyable updated ffp rules mean you really have to budget and plan for smaller or in trouble clubs and transfer fees are still reasonably realistic compared to a few years ago where they would often inflate out of control as seasons progressed there is also more interaction with players such as being able to convince players otherwise out of reach or too good for a club to actually join with the promise of trophies progression or captaincy most players also seem to be realistic about demands too for 2nd and lower tier clubs i have signed some good players coming back from long term injury on reduced terms than they would otherwise be expecting summary overall the game is a decent enough football management sim its great being able to buy players plan tactics and watch everything flourish where i am taking issue with the game as i have for a good 3 years now are the lack of new features and the still present broken ones the 3d engine is widely criticised and has been since inclusion due to poor ai yet si persist with it and never seem to fix it its reached the point where they should abandon that feature and concentrate on their strengths of simulating the running of a football club and player development the lack of true new features is disappointing because there has been no innovation since the 3d match engine back in 2009 there is far more that they can do with the game such as being able to have some interaction with upgrading or building new club facilities training centres camps etc how and when to upgrade stadia creating new feeder teams in upcoming leagues such as mls personally i think that the lack of real competition has caused si to become complacent with new features the game just feels like an updated database of players with a new wrapper yet for all of its flaws it still scratches an itch of running a football club 510

as a seasoned fm gamer & previously cm i am hugely dissapointed with the match engine i have yet to go three straight games without either a goalkeeping howler glitch for either side & atleast once a game the keeper will push a ball onto the post where the ball will stop dead to either a slide tackle goal or slide tackle clearance coupled with 6 strate game in which 2 or more goals were conceded in the last ten mintes with the stench of innevitability unfortunately due to our loyalty there is no major competitor in site that i could recommend either so you will probably just buy it anyway    as i did     and will probably will again

 i won the league with the best goals for and goals against in league 1  near post corner bug clearly isnt going to get patched i conceded 4 near post corners in 5 minutes game time script error  id happily take the money back but i purchased this at a store and ive now activated it  way over priced  way too many high scoring games  set yourself a good formation the cpu will exploit you in ways you didnt no was possible  in a game with birmingham i bid on like 10 players from africa all 10 i had to try convince to join me with a private chat all 10 chats failed  ive completed 11 years on this game in total ive won leagues got promotions so my review will be fair based on my experience  numerous times id be almost guaranteed for a top 6 finish then id win one in the next ten and narrowly miss out on the playoffs  when you change formation constantly in a game it unsettles your players when the cpu changes formation three times in one match they come from how many goals down  when your doing bad you have no idea why i was top with bolton ten games later im 14th but every player still had good or better morale ive always played football management game since the 90s football manager for me is still the most unenjoyable one  too long still way to much time consuming to get through a season  player interaction on it is best left alone im pleased with your training level your club facilities are stopping me getting better morale effected performance effected results effected  tactical importance on this game is way to much you can beat real madrid then the next game walsall could dominate you even win you for anyone thinking about getting this game i would wait until you can get it for 10 i see nothing to convince me that fm16 will be better my overall ratings for it of 10 time value could be slower if i had a bad laptop it would be 1 3 tactics imput outclassed by lower league sides 2 team talk efffect dont see the point in it to keep morale up its a game not real life 3 enjoyment only when your winning on pes 2015 win or lose its still enjoyable 4 transfer system trying to convince those 10 players to join me ridiculous they was on 600 a week and so on 4 my rating for fm 2015 too time consuming still unrealistic results injury bug still even after year after year of fms near post corner bug losing to poor lower league sides due to being tactically outclassed i was doing well in the league then i meet 24th place i lose i meet 23rd i draw i meet 22nd i lose then in the cup i play a nonleague side 30 down at my stadium with a good decent paced creative strong attack good defenders 13 everywhere attributes 5 ill still play it because its football manager but for anyone thinking of buying it dont until the price is reallly down

this game is nowhere near as good as previous seasons they have screwed up on some of the most basic things like for example there are no arrows to scroll down lists you cant switch between manager profiles properly anymore and things that were easily accessible before im struggling to find now i am also having all the same problems as other people like 3 injured players in 1 preseason friendly joke and after that 1 friendly my game crashed and now wont reload i have also bought every football manager since its split from champ man and this is easily the worst i sell games for a living and have always championed fm but from what i have seen so far i am extremely disappointed and wont be advising others ton get it

sports interactive has taken a long look at their primary tactical setup and made changes to make it more relatable to their audience and also more analogous to the influence that reallife managers are able to exert as long as they keep pulling tricks like this football manager is a series that will remain evergreen but the biggest improvement to this game has got to be the match engine year after year were used to the buggy disappointing experience especially for us 3d users but from what ive seen out of my first play currently 18 games into my season excluding friendles i havent seen 1 bug maybe im lucky but for a beta thats impressive its much more fluid and all of the new animations that have been added has really added to the realism the new interface has got to be the biggest plus aswell alot more cleaner kinda looks like a andriod tablet set up with the left hand bar down the side and even when youre scrolling down youre squad list or scout list it feels alot more optimized the game has improved big time on processing speeds im running the same size database with the same leagues as before england scotland spain brazil portugal mls france and germany and the rest of the leagues on view only with a player base of 92000 which doesnt struggle which was one of the down points of fm14 although it was fast there was sometimes youd be going to youre browser while you were waiting theyve also added a new feature where you can choose youre licence and past playing experience which i found to be pretty amazing although i havent fully understood it yet but ill be sure to update this when i do i havent tried classic mode as of yet but looking foward to having a go at it hopefully theyve improved it this year with less clutter and more stats all in all i have to give this game a 910 which is pretty damn impressive for a beta one last thing we still have leaderboards was getting scared as i was seeing tons of ruhmours about it not being in this years version but they were proved wrong hopefully workshop comes back this year too i will be updating this once the offical release on novemember the 7th

hi pro  all the stuff that was shown by developers previous was done interface coach experiance etc negative  there are 2 thing that i consider really bad game results and percentage of shoots on goal i am wining and loosing games tennis stile i am wining with 70 but also loosing with 74 for this i wouldnt recommend still fm2015 because beside the updated database the game is still not a decent evolution form fm2014

i only recently started playing football manager again when i bought 2014 and oh boy is it still addictive play fm 2015 with caution you will be staying up all night and day to see your team win the third division and you will celebrate like you won the champions league before collapsing in exhaustion as if you had just physically played a whole season of football yourself

worst fm ever  even 2013 was way better  so a patch ago  everyone was marking over 45 goals per game they fixed it ok  i can wait a bit  now new patch  every free kick  goal  every corner  goal  you dominate all the game and lose vs a cornerfreekick their goalkeeper is a freaking ninja  yours sucks  attributes dont matter regarding the goalkeeper aguero from man city is a beast  he can mark goals from every position  ive played countless times vs man city  apparently aguero never misses  i do not expect to win vs city but i do not expect to get a goal from every aguero ball touch yes i did marked him and asked my defenders to break his legs  this game killed my nerves  i used to play fm 14 for countless hours and not with big teams i was struggling my way up here if you play vs a big team  regardless of your tactics  you will concede at least 34 goals another bug chelsea has the line throw ups like they are corners if the opposition player has better stats your defender will not even try getting the ball cause that player is imba your defenders will just watch him go around  not even try to get the ball at least seeing them try and fail would do not just seeing them trying to stare the ball out of the opposition else what can i say  this game is not worth buying or playing unless of course you wait 20 patches so they can fix every issue  cause they dont have beta testers or if they have  those guys are  this game was a waste of moneytime

i really love this series of games and have played fm since the 2009 edition this time they have gone a step down in my opinion the new layout is okay the interface bar on the left side instead of the top is a great new thing but from there on its just worse to be honost the tactic section is clumsy and very few things are better and alot of things are worse besides from that it seems like the match engine is way worse too normally there would be some sense of stability but now i can play as man city and win 80 against sportingpor and then lose againt some 3rd division team 36 in the next match theres an unbelieveable amount of injuries which is so damn frustrating the search engine has got a makeover that is for the better although i seem to have a problem finding young players from outside europe without making the leagues playable all in all a turn for the worse but most of the problems could be solved with some updates and maybe a choice to chose the old tactics interface please at this very moment i would not recommend it but as mentioned it could be very recommendable if some fixes come soon over and out christian bang

match engine is still absolutely dreadful and it looks as though its been designed by people who have never watched a football match in their entire lives team instructions are not represented at all during the highlights goalkeepers and defenders do the usual thing of launching long balls instead of doing short passes and the players act like complete idiots wingers shooting from the tighest of angles instead of squaring it to a free team mate for a tap in training is still practically the same as the previous versions with a couple of minor tweaks that dont add anything meaningful short medium or long term basically dont waste your money on this si are taking the money and having a laugh

terrible game ive been buying football manager every year for gods know how many years and this has to be the worse one by far too many bugs even with updates just recently lost all my saved games due to updates interface is ugly gameplay is boring why has it been getting progressively worse each year it should be getting better im disappointed because i loved this game good in a way because i wont be wasting my life playing it no more

there is certainly a lot more going on in this years iteration of fm  certain elements have been changed massively from the fm14 look whilst some have received only a mild tweaking this tends to be the case nearly every year and dont always result in an improved product the changes made this year have largely been pleasing although in particular i am not a fan of the new tactics board it seems like the information i need is still there but it is hidden behind extra menus and mouse clicks generally creating what feels to me like an inefficient system when compared to fm14 the gameplay has remained largely the same and is familiar to anyone who has spent time with the series the engine seems to have been improved in some areas and regressed in others again mirroring previous versions of the game there seem to be more goals going in more goals from crosses and set pieces and more defensive errors the game also seems harder and learns an inflexible managers tactics rather quickly i only use the 2d classic view so cant comment on the 3d match engine i have never used it or had any interest in it fundamentally its still great fun to build and develop a team to argue with other managers and to lead your club to glory or glourious defeat i would definitely recommend this to anyone with more than a passing interest in the franchise and it represents a solid return on investment in terms of new features and gameplay hours

wont be buying football manager 16 as this game is on another level such as price you have to pay for players it can be up 2000% there value wingers run and gradually slow down then are tackled and if a ball goes over the line it is a goal but according to football manager thats not a goal and what is it with clubs not having the badge plus cup logos and kits all ready included if i pay 30 pound for a game i want the game to have the club logos and cup logos and real names many many thing needed to be improved the acutual 3d game when watched is nothing like football a child could tell that 510 need serious improvement to match the price ps sicki baba

this game is probably the worst ever made the skin is confusing they havent added any new useful options in the game but worst of all the game engine i have never ever ever experienced such a completely useless game engine during a match it doesnt matter who you play or whether you play defensive or offensive the result will always be that the will score at least 2 against you and sometimes you score a lot of goals and sometimes you only score once futhermore your players will be injured half of the time even when youre on a roll and havent lost 5 games in a row your team will loose to a team in the bottom so much wrong with this game that they really have to make a lot of updates and quickly even if youre a fan of the series this game is a total catastrophy play fm 14 13 or 12 instead

would be good if it was not for  the ai cheats and handicaps you immensely  the commands you give to players 9 out of 10 times are really lazily being followed how often im not facing a loss because you know players who even are in a good morale do not follow the ing orders  more known teams are getting artificial bonuses which help them win even if their team is inferior  referee ai is unfair towards the human player and cannot detect schwalbes either  amount of players on the transfer list is well complete and utter  maybe its because of selecting just a limited amount of countries but just 56 players at any given moment on the transfer list come ing on

for me the last great fm was 12 i have purchased every edition since the game requires more time and micro managing than ever the user interface oddly is getting worse each year the ui is cluttered and frankly a mess i prefer to use the 2d me i find this is easier to see how my tactics are working but the 3d me has improved you will also find your players constantly moaning about not getting first team football which is a pain in the  i hate the prematch and post match interviews but si have also added tunnel interviews it becomes tedious and a chore very quickly for me with fm13 the game changed direction and is gradually getting worse each year i feel too much has been added to the game and si need to strip the game back a touch the hardcore players argue it is a simulation and realism for me it is just a game and games should be enjoyable fm15 is not unfortunately

i shall try keep this brief as this is making me miss more time in game i have only played this version and its predecessor fm 14 was a great game in its own right and not many improvments needed to be done in my opinion then i strarted fm 15 straight away you can see the changes esp with the new and improved interface it does take a little time getting used to but it is alot more in depth the tactics page you have alot more options on this giving players more options on how to play one of the major flaws however in this years edt of the game which i hope they fix with a patch is how many players get injured in a season it feels more of an action game that could rival max payne games my squad lost 3 keepers for 4 months all due to the same injury at around the same time that is also not to mention all the other injuries i suffered thru the season i also played an internation competion as england and somehow managed to beat germany 8  2 as much as i loved the sore line to the game and i buzzed for a while in reality this is not possible overall the game is very addictive and if youre into these kind of games a must buy

ive picked up fm 2015 after 5 years abstinence and im hooked again match engine has improved since the release with each patch but again there is still room for improvement every new patch states that keeper reactions are fixed but i still fear every shot on goal and slow keeper reactions after the save everyone is complaining about tactical incosistency how you can beat real madrid and loose next match against a lower league team but its good to change up your formation and tactics from time to time for me at least it is something that i like and keeps me playing ui is useful and easy to learn overall game speed is ok im usualy playing with 78 different nation leagues and didnt experience any lag i have no complaints on training and youth development i dont like high transfer values and money spent for weeklymonthly wages but then again thats how it works in reality does it have that addiction spice in the whole mix yes it does at least for me it has  ive been playing fm old cm since i was 13 years old and now im 35  is it worth 50 euros no it certainly is not but then again i didnt have any problem spending that ammount of money because i want to support developers for making one of my favourite games

worst 2999 ive spent on a game this is my first review which will probably show but i felt i had to warn people i was really looking forward to getting this game and thought it looked amazing when i first started playing it the stadia and player animation are great and the feel of the prematch game itself is good training and scouting are easy to manage as is the creation of friendly matches board and player interaction is fine and i particularly like how whole team chats work if only i could say the same for the rest of it i am currently half way through my fourth season and am so frustrated with the game ive given it a reasonably good chance check my hours played not as many as others granted but still quite a bit considering the flaws in the game and here i am sitting as usual with half my first team medium or long term injured ive hired better physios tweaked training to ensure that it wasnt too strenuous and ensured that my coaches were well matched to training routines still its happening ive checked others reviews and plenty of people are finding the same si need to resolve this the game is completely unrealistic in this area and its spoiling it for myself and others who have sadly paid good money for the pleasure of playing it the other big fault is the performance of goalies when the match engine is running i mean a 23 cap goalie with 1720 for one on ones standing with hands on hips with messi bursting into the penalty box goalies with high stats for jumping reach and agility unable to reach a chest height shot from a marauding opposition defender a new update came in today and i was hoping at least one of these two problems would be sorted i played four matches against mediocre sides 12 04 10 woohoo and 03 im no fm tactical expert but im not by any means a noob or a rookie ive been playing si football management games each year since championship manager 93 yep 1993 <grabs flat cap pipe and slippers> have in past games won plenty of back to back promotions won european trophies and plenty of league championships i buy players specifically to fit my systems and use their info to adjust strategies my understanding of tactics cant be that bad of all the 20 odd si games in the original cm fm series that ive played this one is the most inconsistent and most frustrating of all of them in the four matches played today in addition to the 6 long mid term injured first team players out i had injuries as follows game 1  cm and wb both out 911 days game 2  no injuries game 3  cm cd and lone striker all out between 911 days and 3 weeks each game 4  wb out 6 days oh and a training injury to my 2nd best wb  out for 2 weeks from half way between game 3 and game 4 will probably have wait until fm 2016 before these flaws are resolved people have been raising them on forums for months now and nothing has been done however sis attention will most likely be firmly on thinking on the next game in the series unlikely that anyone from si will read this but if they do  remember that people have paid for this game guys im pretty sure that from what i remember cm and fm games used to be delayed until the match engine was just right that was worth it this time its been comparatively all looks and no substance which is a real shame for now im going back to playing champ manager 9394 on my old amiga anyone remember them 18 players called tadeusz kruszinski and only english leagues available but at least it had a match engine that worked

i was more than happy to splash out on fm15 when it was released and looked forward to playing the updated game how wrong could i be this game is beyond flawed  i gave it half a season first time round then went back to fm14  i then waited for the january update and went back to it  to find the game slightly more playable only for without warning all the glitches in the match engine to return as soon as i hit november first ever game with southampton was horrendous 4 pre seaons games and i lost pelletadicwanyama and alderwield all to injuries of 34 months first league game 20 up with 10 mins to go at home to palace beat 32 there was obviously a fault with the number of serious injuries your team received  i was using all my subs to replace injured or players carrying knocks my latest save with lazio has been the final straw first 6 games  cessena a won 30  genoa h won 61  empoli h won 31  verona a won 41  juventus a won 21  parma h won 10 now everything was looking fantastic my team were conceding very few goals  dominating possesion and chances created in every game and the players all seemed to be carrying out there roles as instructed on top of that klose was banging in the goals with 8 in his first 6 games however it was at the parma game that everything suddenly went horrendously wrong for seemingly no reason i have to make 3 subs in the first 30 mins because of injury  i then change team instructions to stand off opponenets and stay on feet apparently that doesnt work and i receive 2 red cards in quick succession even going ultra defensive and playing on the counter with 9 men  i still totally outplay parma but despite creating numerous chances all are fired off target or there keeper starts making wonder saves i had also signed victor valdes on a free transfer so now he was match fit  i put him into my starting 11 in place of a mediocre keeper i did have thinking hopefully now i have a decent goalkeeper all should be good next 6 games udinese a drew 00  roma h drew 22  empoli h italian cup won 20  ac milan a lost 10  torino h lost 20  palermo a lost 30 only thing that seems to have improved is the reduction in injuries to players during matches that being said i know lazio are in rome but training must involve swords and be held at the collosium as at least 5 first choice players have missed games with injuries picked up during training  now surely this cant happen my team that was performing so well has now lost the ability to do anything klose has no goals in last 6 i seen penalties missed in the udineseroma and ac milan games players seem to be running in quick sand as the chase down through balls and world class goalkeeper couldnt catch a cold his positioning is terrible seems to run out and conceedes all his goals from nothing shots at his near post  the roma game was nearly the final straw i had led 10 and 21 and then watch roma come back and equalise the next minute then go 32 up only for it be chopped off the game is obviously full of glitches and bugs and to make it worse these now seem to be creeping there way into the updates for fm14  si games and sega desperatly need to get there finger out and get these fixed as from what im reading in the reviews all the fans of the series are at there wits end with how bad this version of the title is it does pain me to say this but avoid this game if you are a fan of the series or someone contemplating taking it up as you will be put off for life

762015 do not buy this game as the patches have still not sorted the bugs ive bought every fm and cm for as long as i can remember but i waited until recently to purchase fm15 because of the reports of the large amount of goals that are being scored in peoples games as well as the constant injuries read the si forums i bought the game which also had the new patch so i was hopeful of these bugs being sorted i wouldnt say i experienced a great deal of goals in my game although i do play very defensive i did however find that players were getting injured all of the time during matches and during training it ended up that i was making substitutions in the first half of most matches half the team will take knocks and 2 or 3 players on average will have to leave the field due to injury the last straw came in the champions league when i had done all substitutions due to injuries  not knocks and then my keeper and right back got knocks my keeper would not move due to the injury and a goal was scored i ended the game with 9 men i feel really bad for the people who bought the game full price

i have had football manager since 2010 enjoyed playing iit greatly for years i enjoyed the ability to micromanage the little things in the game mainly the sliders if my team was getting scored on a great deal move thedefensive line slider back a few notches of which i had twenty a few years ago they decided to do away with the sliders but keep them optional to simplify the game fine i still have them the last few years completly gone and its obvious to anyone who plays the game that the system is exactly the same the player and team instructions are still moving sliders in the background so i am at the point where i am just not interested in the game anymore i am sure there are people out there that like to tinker and micromanage their games people that enjoy games like europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2 football manager has been one of my favorite games i hope they can listen to their fans and bring back what we all loved about the game

like any gamers mention it really disappointing defender wont chase the ball player suddenly fell down without being tackle ball bounce off of your player and then goes straight in to own goal really during the match the players just standing around the ball doing nothing making donuts move omfg

short and sweet you will concede 98% of your goals through the crossingcornerfree kick fault no matter how many you score you can guarentee the other team no matter their stature can and probably will pull it back to win by 2 or 3

i want to like it really i do but im struggling for a variety of reasons the new interface is nice ill give it that but when you sign three new players in preseason and it injures all of them in a friendly you start to think its gonna go badly and then it does the game is just so hateful a fresh injury every game keepers fumbling the ball into their own net in the last minute against bottom of the league a 5 striker who couldnt hit a barn door from two yards half the squad whinging because i sold a terrible 16 year old fullback for a million quid the list goes on ill persevere a while yet hopeful that itll improve maybe theyll update the match engine and give me a chance but if they dont ill go back to fm14 and write this off as 30 wasted

i buy fm every other year so can only comapre it to 2013 i think the layout of menus has improved although it takes a little while to get used to interactions with players staff and media is a lot better i wouldnt say that the match engine is vastly inferior to 2013 i recommend this

i was losing all games with ac milan could not get my head around it tried several tactics changed focus and training talked to players motivated them took care of shape and condition zero goals almost all losses i took over the weakest team to play against myself asked my assistant about starting 11 set no tacticts gave no orders ignored everything and i won against ac milan 42 this makes no sense at all and all goals are from crosses and jeez too many injuries

warning do not buy this game ive been a loyal fan of fm for almost a decade now this is by far the worst fm ever produced loading the menu screen is slow network games have become intollerable because of the lag and the injuries have become so frequent that it borders on the absurd they had one job to do all year since the last fm which was to update the squads and update the scouting stats now im angry at valve for having a no refund policy

constant runtime errors have done everything recommended to fix the problem but it still persists after a few games there are problems with this game every single release i had decided not to buy this year as it is a total pain every year waiting for all the bugs to be fixed as usual it will be january before the game is playablestop releasing broken games

sports interactive have really made a mess of this game if you dont want to have a stroke because burnley are playing like real madrid and your keeper parries the ball to opposition feet then avoid buying it far too many injuries leaving you to play with your worst players tactics you set seem to be ignored players are too easily offended if and its a big if you get things going your way youll soon be slapped back down again by overall poor performances or injuries awful players also moan too much about game time which puts everyone on their period and you have to walk on egg shells my god if i could swear on this i would i have an alienware pc and with fm14 i could set the graphics to highest settings and it would play smoothly all day long this pc eats up the system requirements and asks for seconds but on fm15 exactly the same requirements i have to leave it on medium otherwise the match engine struggles ive loved all the fms and it rarely disappoints but fm15 has really let me down angry with it in fact extremely disappointed with it ill return to fm14 to allow my blood to come off the boil and simmer

finally a reason to buy a new installment of this classic try the demo for free if you are an exaddict like me tldr summary player interaction massively improved coaching during the match massively improved match representation slightly improved if they used cgi capture for those movements than they have a lot to learn tactical finetuning  massively improved your profile as manager has a big impact on the game tracksuit or tactical manager transfers are more immersive  players will actually ask for a transfer if a big team shows interest like the sound of that read for more i bought every version from championship manager 2 1995ish to football manager 2010 then i bought 2011 on discount 2012 on discount and 2013 on discount and i realised i was stupid i was basically paying for a databaseupdate a brilliant update dont get me wrong but the game never moved on i skipped 2014 after playing the demo i just wasnt interested and decided to go back to championsip manager 0102 and try and safe sheffield wednesday from doom the gameplay was basically a bit simpler but no less engrossing i doubted about getting this so i tried the demo  and it worked more games need demos but aside from that the interface has finally undergone a modernisation process although at times annoying because you cant find things that were previously easily accessible i tried to find where jobs went for example but if it had just been the interface i still would have felt duped there is more to it than just the interface some of this might be gaming elements that were introduced in 2014 i am not sure because i never played that so a few examples to augment the tldr list this is from my first two games wednesday in the demo and wrexham in the full version interaction with players jeremy helan my french leftback is injured but comes back a couple of weeks before the transfer deadline his first game he plays well despite not being matchfit for some reason olympique marseille shows some interest in him and he requests to be allowed to speak to them i calmly tell him that i will if they put an acceptable offer forward they never did and he didnt grumble instead carrying on coaching during the match my fm manager persona is that of a calm occassionally passionate tracksuit manager in my wrexham career that calmness got severely tested when in a game my right back who had woefully underperformed all season got sent off wrongly and we conceded a penalty against bottom of the league welling we were 3th in the conference and smiling we go 10 down but i keep telling my players to concentrate and we pull one back just before the break after my central defender suffers injury after i used all my subs in the 60th minute they score another goal very quickly i tell my guys that there is no pressure and they manage to limit the damage with 9 man on the pitch to a 31 undeserved loss the following game however my captain and central midfielder gets himself sent off in the 10th minute despite me telling my team to not go hard into tackles he was just stupid we concede in the 23th minute and i tell my guys to show some passion we nearly score but in the 34th minute my left back gets his second yellow card in 3 minutes again down to 9 men but this time against gateshead a decent team they take us to pieces and end up losing 40 throughout the game i have been telling them there is no pressure anymore i needed to to manage morale following game after fining the idiots that got sent off i make some tactical alterations to fill in the gaps left by the banned players but it doesnt work woking score in the 24th minute and we seem unable to resist i change things around on the fly pushing them all higher encouraging them telling them they can do it and they do end of the game we have won 41 i have never felt so immersed with the actual matches in fm the animations are still mostly pointless playing this on a low gpu power laptop though but it doesnt matter you can now really put your mark on things from the sideline more effectively than ever before i might revisit this review when i have finished a few seasons but i have to give this version a massive thumbsup and if you are an expired fan of the series then treat yourself to this one

ok i regret to say that i am editing my review from being a positive one to a very negative one read below and you will see i am a fm vet of many years sad to say this is the worste fm i have ever played the full release is no diffrent to the beta my main issue is the relentless injuries and inabblity to sign players i have 6 injuries at any given time i started a new game with man city and i have 9 injuries at the moment i have not even had a chance to play david silva as he gets injured every 2 seconds the colour scheme is very poor and there arnt even proper badges for bpl teams the action bar seems to get smaller and smaller every year si dont forget that the vet players have used the action bar for years we dont use the 2d or 3d view thats not footballmanger players fall out with you for selling an uknown 15 year old with cf with 2 finishing whats that about its all just been simplified and not in a good way sorry fm i have loved you for 20 odd years but now i am falling out of love i am bitterly dissapointed to the point of wanting a refund i feel like i have paid 30 quid for a beta thanks  game developers in 2014 are taking us all for a ride bellow is my old positive review while playing the beta if it wernt for the houndreds and thousands of hours ive spent playing football manager since i was 11 years old i may have achivied something with my life ive been playing since it was championship manager 2000 the season luis figo joined madrid im now 29 and living at home with my mum warning new players this game will take over your life you will never get laid again now to the review ok so theres no badges for the english premier league teams but its still seems like an improvment on last years there are a few new features and layouts to get used to the screens have changed a lot tac screen ect is completely diffrent the news headline page almost made me throw up when i saw the relentlessly awfull culours lucky you can change you landing screen so you never have to view that mess again lol all in all after 3 hours of playing i hardly scratched the surface of the new features injuries also seem a little relentless but i am hoping these will be ironed out after the beta i hope this review helps ok i am adding in a little moan i have done 3 seasons with barca and finaly have the transfer embargo liffted however i cant sign anyone i mean juventus want 300 million for pogba and he keeps saying he wants to join but does not hand in a transfer request also other players are demanding huge fees chelsea want 80 million for azplicueta i am all for making the game realistic but i need to sign players at some point the game is out today and i am now bored of it for the first year in 20 i may be free

comparisons between 2014 and 2015 are like night and day ui and features have been improved but the match engine and gameplay are very very poor there are problems in the match engine right now that have been in the game since release problems that we have been told have been fixed and yet still remain 2015 is a mere shadow of what 2014 was and this version has left a very sour taste when it comes to fm games in general not sure ill be pursuing 2016 when it comes around

ive played until the end of the january transfer windows in my first season in the premiership basically my opinion is that the game has no realism as previous fms have been the game is competely full of injuries penalties and high scoring games that would simply no happen in real life having read reviews of other gamers of fm15 it would appear that im not alone on this a update is badly needed for this as for the 3d match engine it looks like a cross between table top football and subbuteo fm has been using the 3d match engine for many years now and it would appear that it has hardly been improved despite all the techology available these days im afraid that the game is no longer enjoyable i would recommend anyone sitting on the fence about buying it to avoid it stick to fm14 until they sort this out

as someone with no previous experience in this series and no grasp of football beyond the immidiate game i found this game absolutely impenetrable i enjoy the managing of complex systems huge fan of crusader kings 2 and can see how there is a rich variety of options and nuiance available that said the game is lacking in a clear entry point for the true noivce the beginner difficultymode as best i can tell only adds small text notes with insipid hints like this is the sidebar menu with has options for manging your team after hitting use suggestion during the setup a few times which was useful you are dumped to a general game screen with 1000s of options and no clear direction it is fine to have numerous tools at the players disposal that they dont appreicate immediately but you need to tutorialize the core game in some way as a starting point for them to explore and build off from instead it left the clear impression that you need to go watch some youtube videos of other players for several hours to get the basics making it feel more like learning a software interface than playing a game i will however say kudos to the developer for having a free weekend to try the game out at no risk the downside to this is that players will on a lark just try the game without doing a little reseach first if this was something i was condsidering purchasing i would have likely watched some videos and incidently picked up the training necessary to play before experiencing it first hand please consider adding a proper tutorial if you are going to have a freetoplay weekend so people have a chance to enjoy the opportunity

this will be a twofold review while somethings in the review is related together non football fans this game is vastly huge in terms of stat and detail make sure that you constantly take care of your team and watch what you say because every action could affect the reputation of the team and you i highly suggest you read up on guides or watch lps of this game also ask the steam community of this game for advice for newcommers like myself its an enjoyable game but really high on detail which is always nice to see lastly the online side of things i highly suggest playing with newcomers to get accquianted with the game together rather than having an expert a familiar and a noob playing the game football fans this game is meant for the gamer who loves football this game strives to achieve what everyone who loves football wants to do run your own team choose your teams style of training pick players trade players negoitate for contracts and deals its really a good simulator for manager games and if you grow tried of singleplayer action try online in all honesty the online portion feels like a louge game just sit back relax and have fun speaking of which this game isnt meant to be taken too seriously its a managment sim lol also with mod support the game will become either better or more challenging depending upon your time of playstyle another thing this game goes all out in terms of keeping you and your friends in the loop through social media venues as well the only real negavtive about this game is lack of updates now this could be because of the choices you made in the game but even then if a player is injuried i want to know first thing so i can respond to that another thing is that the mood system isnt all that great since the game doesnt really outline difference in mood apporches to handling players the board of the team your representing and other teams lastly the media do i recommend it yes i do for football fans who have seen and pratically worship this sport as for newcomers i also recommend it however i do advise you do some research and ask people for opinions

i read all the negative reviews before getting this game but i bought it anyway to see for myself that was in early december i still havent been able to get a good save going yet despite my best efforts for some unknown reason the better the club you choose the more injuries you get anything from 14 injuries a game in the prem anyone who has played previous versions of the game will know that the interface has always been a bit boring but really easy and handy to know where everything is in 15 theyve taken into account the slightly uninspiring interface but have shuffled it all about really badly and you have to relearn where everything is the main top bar has been moved to the left side of the screenits just confusing fm 15 takes their you will concede 2 or 3 in stoppage time rule to the next level its virtually impossible to hold on to a lead it doesnt matter if your team has great composure bravery team work concentration etc you will always concede goals in the final minutes basically if your team is 10 up at the 75th minute mark you may as well turn your computer off i was playing as man city on three occasions i was 10 up in the 85th minute i did three different things each time 1st game  i dropped back and defended my lead i lost 21 vs stoke 2nd game  i pushed up and uninvited pressure i played the offside trap i lost 31 vs west brom 3rd game  i changed to a 650 every player on the pitch went into a defensive position to block the goal i lost 21 vs crystal palace it happens 910 times fair enough but when it happens so frequently its just screams broken you end up losing your lead in a burst of sudden energy from the other team what makes it happen its almost half scripted if im ahead at half time i always think to myself it doesnt matter ill still lose i downvote this game because it is simply against you not in a challenging way but in more of a  you way

the worst fm game ive played to date and ive pretty much played them all the footballers have absolutely zero intelligence or skill even with world class players like messi they constantly pass the ball to enemy players straight to them watch motionless as the ball rolls inches past them at a snails pace including goalkeepers and generally do really really stupid things ive watched my keeper and a striker out for a lose ball the keeper is over twice as close to it and its moving towards him he gets close to the ball then stops and waits for the striker to come get it then shoot past him some of the games are clearly rigged as well just to test this i saved a game before a arsenal vs chelsea game and replayed it quite a few times using different tactics and crippling the enemy team all players 50% condition terrible morale star players crippled they still win 30 repeatedly its an impossible senario once or twice sure but 10 times in a row the player stats are just silly clearly very little to no research has gone into them most of the players dont acutally perform best in the role they do in reallife finally nothing has improved from 2014 absolutely nothing they have changed a few bits round but that is all really really disappointed

i dont know how to break this news to anyone especially sigames if they are even interested enough to read these reviews but  well i sort of rolled into fm back in 2010 which is not as long ago as some of you but long enough to make a valid opinion i think i really am glad that the time of cardboard public around the field is history believe me as is the time that the owner of the club you managed sold your players from under you without even so much as a warning but thats realy all the positive feedback i have to give about football manager 2015 okay let me explain i usually play fm when i wake up and am in no way shape or form capable to play any action game whatsoever being as old as i am almost 60 so i love to start my day with fm to each his own right  then you should know i once was a rather fanatical ajax fan started out at 7 years old but those times are over since 1997 ajax utterly ruined that and destroyed their true fans in the process i still love the game though eventhough these days it seems to me more like a bussiness with emplyees then a sports club with players that still know clubhonor and real diehard fans that dont hate the rival fans to the point of letteral murder and sorry to say fm mirrors that a bit and does that more and more but let me tell you first of all i really hate mandatory something from my youth no doubt and the mandatory team chat of fm14 was a sharp pain to live with i usually did those with my eyes closed and got out at the first chance i got not even knowing what i just said i just wanted out now in fm15 when you finally have a first team together that plays well players like each other and you win more games then you lose chances are that some damn snotnose from the second or 3rd team comes asking for firstteam foortball sigh when you look at his stats you just laugh i have been a footballer myself quite some time ago obviously on quite a high level even mind you i even played for ajax a few weeks before i failed the medical but i wouldnt have dared to go to the first team manager and ask him to be in his team or ill be unhappy  wtf  ha he would recommend me to cry a while on my mommys lap or if that wouldnt be good enough he would give me the number of a good shrink and send me off with a slap on the back of my head and quite rightly so in past fm games i never gave them the time of day if anyone was any good his own trainer or my chief schout would tip me of on his existence or progress and that was it now in fm15 it is mandatory to speak to this snotnose really  oh yeah i can decline but if i decline chances are that half my team will be saying that i handled him unfairfly and now they are unhappy so gone team balance  arggghhh i am in charge you ing overpaid brats if you dont like it go play in the reserve team for a while see if you like that better i will lose many game or get sacked because of that but hell that feels so goood and then i havent told you about that if you have a really important game 90% chance your best striker will tear a muscle on the trainings field one or two days before the match and will be unavailable for 3 bloody months sigh oh and can count yourself lucky if your best defender isnt injured as well have i told you yet how many times one of our stikers is offside in one single game  10723548303times thats how many now ill tell you ive seen enough games been to games and played enough games to know that this is utterly unrealistic at best and plain imposible usually and half the time its not even true nope no offside at all fm must use that as a ballance mechanism or something listen si get at least the bloody rules of this game straight will ya  and while you are at it do your bloody research when i won the club wold cup with ajax the game talls me this was a historic first time no it was not ajax already won it twice before first time early seventies i think against independiente not sure i was still young second time i remember welll against gremio blind made the winning goal so this would be the third time sports interactive is slipping in more ways then one so it would seem about that offside if my midielder launches a long ranged shot it comes back from the opposite team keeper who could only parry it and my striker scores from the rebound it is not offside thats a blatant lie then the whisle goes and the comments say the whisle had already gone no  it did not it just went so even if my striker was offside your bloody whistle should have been going the second the ball left my midfielders foot not a minute later when my stiker scores the rebound you incompetent  agh then half my players look like in albinos white as snow very irritating nothing wrong with albinos per se apart from that that i heard that they dont see too well but i simply cant remember ever seeing a team with 6 albino players on each side also players warp all over the field on occasion which is rather immercive breaking up to the point where it becomes utterly rediculus so you can only play this game on the shortest highlights thank you si that is some ing incompetant coding okay i know yes really i do you can not win all games that should be obvious to anyone unless you cheat but when spirits are high moods at at top level every one in the team is top fit and inspired to win and this is in no way easy to acomplish trust me then there is no bloody way that my team suddenly cant play football anymore passes are 90% wrong they miss most headers they get yellow and red cards all over the place no no no no way sure even with everything good and in place we could still lose the game it happens but not with a team that looked like i just fielded a 3rd team of incompetant todlers pfff okay those who know me know i will always give you the truth as i see it which obviously isnt the ultimate truth what is  but after having played fm15 for as long as it is out and having played fm10 fm11  fm12  fm13 and fm14 to death i simply cannot recommend fm15 and live with myself i simply can not i love this game i really do but i hate fm15 still i do not regret buying it simply because i have gotten so much pleasure out of the previous installments that i dont mind giving the folks at si some donation but i think i will go back to fm12 when the game was still fun and hope fm16 will be better but i will no longer prepurchase this game so as things stand i can not recomend this version of football manager to anyone unless you are a masocist so i am sorry si but i simply can not guys and girls do yourself a faviour and to be completely honest imho fm 2012 was the last superior game fm15 like to some extend 13 and 14 is one long big pester campaign made to ruin your day and good mood completely it is in no way any fun and it will put you off of on one of the best if not the best football manager simulation games around i am sorry to say edit i finally deinstalled this game and reinstalled fm 2012 now i can have fun and positive frustration again with my morning coffee and all will be well abraxas

i was really disappointed with the previous football manager 2014 so i couldnt bring myself to pay out of my own wallet for it this year i got this as a gift for christmas and thought you know what lets give sports interactive another chance i started as unemployed and took the morcambe job in the middle of the season i spent the best part of an hour and a half setting up training bringing in coaches creating a good tactic and getting to know my squad within 20 minutes of my first match my keeper catches a lazy effort from 30 yards out only to turn around stroll back into his own net with the ball clutched in hands quit game uninstall

i cant recommend this game despite it improving in many ways from previous versions the reason for this is the focus on player interaction this year players have always got unhappy for not getting enough game time too much competition etc this year not only does this happen more frequently but often without any justification you then get to try to talk them round which almost always ends in half the squad becoming unhappy at this point team morale is very low meaning you lose a lot and the only way to turn this around is to try and sell most of the team before you get sacked hopefully si will fix this in the next patch

i preordered the game a few moneths ago and had been desperately excited for it ever since however i have to say it is probably the worst version in years i appreciate the need to change certain aspects of the gamplay and format in order to develop and move forward but im afraid to say that this attempt has if anything moved the game backwards dont get me wrong i will still play it religiously and undoubtedly enjoy it in the process as i have done over many years now but i cant help but feel disappointed with the outcome of this seasons product

get the snacks ready guys this is going to be a long one ive been playing fm properly since 09 and this visually is definately the most pleasing on the eye although it is expected with most games that are in a series each year graphics improve etc but ive noticed in previous years the creators talk about our new and improved match engine whereas in reality it isnt much different but i have to admit this year there is a difference the 3d match engine is actually really evident football manager to me was always a game that every part of it seemed as close to realism as it could yet when it came to the matches it just let the whole feel of realism down a touch the players movement looks better the shooting passing diving tackling all just looks better although i dont think they thought through the appearence of players that well eg aaron cresswell west ham left back had ginger hair in my game the interface of the menu screens has had a huge revamp in previous years the interface had hardly changed and it kind of made me question in what is the point in buying a game that looks the same just maybe updated teams hence the reason i stopped buying fifa but this game actually looks like a new game to a certain extent the originial drop down bar which is now down the left side of the screen is a great feature with added tabs in the bar it makes navigating around quicker which for me makes the game more enjoyable but that is just a personal preference im not sure if its to do with the game itself but from the last time i played fm14 until now i had upgraded my pc and bought a highend graphics card so the general visual aspects of the game may vary depending on your own pcs gpu but for me it looks great especially with the added facepacks bages kits etc the actual features of the game have been improved aswell the tactics screen has had a complete change to selecting players and player roles including new roles which once i got use to the functions of it all seemed like a good way they have upgraded from the normal tactics drag and drop & click 2 buttons done i havent played as much as some but long enough i think to make a judgement on the game and i appreciate that the game is still in beta and will have some bugs like 9 of my first squad players getting injured in preseason and my cb getting sentoff 4 game he played in a row but come november 7th on full release i think we will all have a fantastic game to enjoy for the next 12 months be it if your a experienced fm player like myself or if its the first time picking up the game & if you are a newbie little tip for you coaches will save your season but anyway guys work tommorow and its way past my bed time hopefully we can all enjoy this new fm installment cherriooo

its just not ready i really like the new look sidebar scouting match graphics its all very nice its going to be a great game its playable but i wouldnt start a long term save until some of the problems get sorted out injuries for some are out of control crosses are overpowered too many long range shots too many goals a lot of 50 74 games every year you get a release that needs to be patched before you can fully enjoy it this year is no different you see a lot of people upset and give bad reviews understandable if i paying for a game i want a finished product im half way into a chelsea save and have seen a lot of injuries early when the players were out of shape training was heavy and tactics were fast after some tweaking they stopped i am seeing overpowered crosses terry scores a hattrick some high scoring games once those issues get patched hopefully soon and not feb which seem to be just adjustments this game is going to be a great game buy it check out the new features get all your pics and logos ready test out tactics and play a few test games so youll be ready

two main things really get me angry about the fm series first off the match engine is not something to be expected for a anno 2014 game without getting more detailed it is obvious that si doesnt want this to be improved as modern technology at tjis point really could offer something a hundred times better wake up si were not handheld here ps praise the lord that this sht is still better than eas fifa manager  the second most important thing for me is the pretty low amount of team licences offered by the game this really bugs me because even if you play a manager game for the management style you still have that favorite team it really bugs me how si doesnt have team licences for first division teams across europe

having put in 1000 or so hours into the 2011 2012 and 2013 versions altogether i can safely say that football manager 2015 is the worst ive played so far and not worst as in its still enjoyable worst as in its just not a good or fun game anymore something has been changed since those games that i cant explain sides with the best defence in the leage concede 4 in the first 10 minutes of the game the top 4 teams in real life lounge around in lower mid table positions youth players ask for wages of a consistent first team player and the match engine dear god the match engine players are clearly fouled but the referees do nothing players simply stand and watch as others walk past them tackles are so few and far between that im not sure playing defenders is worth it and scores with 8 goals or more are not nearly as rare as they should be if you want to play football manager get 2012 or 2013 because this one sucks

this genre desperately needs competition si are complacent although this game is far and away better than 2014 i still cannot recommend it due to the stupid level of scripting si have in their game i get that the stories are what make this game fun but id much rather they unfolded organically than being shoehornedin by a dev team who clearly need to rein them in far far too many matches outcomes are predetermined those of you who have not played this game series as much of some of us may not have the hours necessary to recognize the patterns im talking about but theyre as follows  lose to a minnow in an important match  losewin the 2nd leg of a tourney knockout round after being hammered or hammering the opposition in the first leg  losewin the next important against a rival youve just lostwon a different important match to recently its ing ridiculous how often these occur in game yes they do happen in real life but nowhere near as often as they happen in fm si need to dial this  down because its truly tiring going into a match already knowing the outcome because the aforementioned criteria have been met

as an avid football manager fan i am bitterly disappointed at this latest attempt the match stats regularly baffle me i often have 30  attempts on goal which is ridiculous anyway but even with a natural finisher in sturridge upfront i have 2 or 3 on target and lose the game it is by far the most unrealistic installment i have played highly un recommended

not recommended
not even worth the reduced price 10 i paid for it truly frustrating the tactical changes make no difference to the match outcomes the match engine cannot handle defence it is impossible to defend crosses the players stand around not moving and watch the opposition run straight past them or just fail to run to the loose ball

this game is a ing waste of time and money explain to me how they think football works you can scores goals from corners and crosses but no straight on you can have a better team rating and better players than your opponent and you still lose 3 0 at home ing  fix your ing game i wish that you could send your staff to courses or classes on becoming a better specialist at the current job they are in i also wish you could plan training camps to strengthen your team and players the good aspects of this game is that you can talk to players and staff which is good the bad aspects of this game is that you cant plan training camps or even upgrade your training facilities because they club doesnt think its a good idea it feels like im controlling manchester united and my opponent is cardiff city im playing at home and cardiff are winning 30 at half time that never ing happens this game at this moment in time gets a 4 out of 10 rating

ive been playing football manager since fm 2011 and have been hooked with the series ever since fm 15 is a great advancement in the series with great new ideas implemented into the game however i feel that some features need to be refined as it did not keep me as entertained as fm 14 did the implementation of the tactical and tracksuit manager was a good idea in theory but i did not feel it had a major impact within the game as you were never really prompted to pursue coaching badges or felt it had any real impact within the game the new user interface was a great change within the as i felt it made it much more compact and concise as well as being more convenient on the left hand side of the page the changes to the match engine were extremely broken at first with the countless gk and defensive mistakes however after many patches they were fixed and i can see the improvement from the previous years overall fm 15 has been a good iteration of the football manager series having quite a few improvements than its previous ones however my hope for fm 16 would be that these features be kept but improved upon and refined 8510

although the football manager series are excellent games i find these games too complicated and not friendly to play for anyone that likes a to play through seasons relatively quickly you have to spend hours searching for players with scouts and tinker with training and tactics too much to get the best results in fm i guess for every manager its different i liked the old simple buysell players pick your team and set a tactic and continue playing without having to struggle with arsenal in a relegation dogfight and get sacked before christmas i guess i prefer the older versions of the game when it was known as championship manager

i feel like some people who are reviewing this game just quickly make a tactic and expect to do well this version was made as people want a game that is as realistic as possible so do to this you must be prepared to treat the game as realistically as possible spend more time on your tactics look at match stats and focus what your efforts are on if you buy this game you must be prepared to spend time on your team to make them succeed a lot of the people who are complaining about the game probably dont know about all of the features such as comparing your team to other teams in the league based on player ratings for certain attributes sure the game wont follow reality that closely it would be impossible to do so for example the game cannot include certain outside influences eg player moral in real life etc the developers were asked to make it as realistic as possible so please understand what this game is do not buy it if you are looking for an easy game that you can spend 0 time on and then want to moan about it later sure it has some failings but thats the same with every game like this
recommended
figured id give this game a try since its so highly recommended and seemed interesting what i ended up getting was a huge amount of information poured into my brain at such a fast speed that there was hardly time to process it all im not very familiar with football anyway but with hardly anything getting explained and the supposed indepth tutorial only providing the occasional bubble of explanation its very easy to get lost in this game very quickly and end up in a situation where you can just stare at the screen saying i have no idea what any of this means does or why its important

was finally due to the sale price enticed to buy the game got pretty excited i found the new layout to be quite nifty interactions were nifty and then it got to the point where i was taking a closer look at my favorite club which is at point of writing at least still in the top 50 of biggest european clubs  the budget was all wrong some player names were horribly botched positions were botched potential for the academy players and status in the club was just awfully put together transfervalues were completely messed up the man whos supposedly the player with the highest value in the squad is actually in real life the most shunned and loathed player who the fans hope the club gets rid of as soon as they can and a substitute at most the list goes on and on and on cant recommend something that made me so upset right off the bat

i played the demo first then played the free weekend so although i only have a few hours gameplay in fm15 i have over 200 each in fm14 13121110 and 09 so id like to think that i know what im looking at despite my obvious love for the series i cannot recommend this gameedition for this very simple reason ideas good execution poor the ideasupdates that si have implemented into the game such as expanded conversations and tactics are good in principle but the execution of them has been poor to say the least as just one example many times i was presented with a response that caused players to react in completely the opposite way that the response dictates that they should even now the injury problem hasnt been properly fixed despite it being 89 months since the game was released the aimatch engine simply cannot defend and this isnt a tactical issue the goalkeepers refuse to pick up the ball from no more than 5 yards away and instead insist on waiting for another player to touch the ball before reacting to it if you have fm14 already then update the leagues etc using the many mods in the workshop and avoid fm15 if you dont have fm14 buy fm14 and just wait for fm16 to come out overall fm14 despite having some issues of its own is a far less broken game than fm15 is and the problems that si didnt fix themselves with fm14 the community has

skip this one i went back to 2014 fairly quickly after the excitement of trying a new fm had faded there are some nice additions to the game but theyve also changed what wasnt broken and in doing so have destroyed the realistic play seen in 14 the match engine with some new graphical additions off the pitch which are quite cool is simply nowhere near good enough for general release the redesign of the players and their animations is atrocious if you can watch a match and not notice the hilarious arms of the players then youre lyring to yourself this is more like an experiment with ragdoll physics than a football match engine players plod about the pitch with no real life in them the ball moves poorly and the pitches now look bogged down and ugly as hell no matter where you are tactics are not easy to really see in the match itself nothing is realistic in terms of the way the team moves the ball and thats on top of the horrible animations keepers are a little better animated and as i mentioned the stadiums have more detail and things but that doesnt make up for the core element of the game being so badly designed fm2014 isnt perfect but the match engine craps all over this one from a great height gone are the days of your lightning winger flying past his full back and getting a cross in now they waddle around with all the urgency of a bored duck theres no more slick passing moves that take into account your tactical instrucions the ball now moves so slow and the poor new sound effect for the ball being hit doesnt help again it just sludges around the pitch to no great effect the colours of shirts and things are also far too bright for no reason this wasnt present in 2014 there are things i really like female managers extra things to say to players a way to convince players your club is the one for them the sidebar being more intuitive and things generally being placed in area where theyre more easy to find and helpful than previous working my way through preseason i was absolutely enthralled with this game until the first friendly kicked off and the immersion just vanished in front of my eyes how pale are the really white players now they look ill arms are pathetic tricks are pathetic the whole thing looks far less graphically impressive than 14 which is hardly fifa level to begin with theres no excuse for this and no way to return the game and spend the money on something else like both seasons of walking dead get fm2014 with a good skin and all the badges logos etc from the workshop and save yourself some money on this checking back in october to see if theyve reworked the engine if not then i might have to finally say si have lost their way

having read many of the other reviews i felt compelled to provide my own please note that my play time is considerably more than is logged since i play mostly offline currently as expected this version of the game isnt perfect some of the criticisms outlined in other reviews are accurate however i must argue against a couple of points made firstly the match engine seems fine to me i seem to score relatively regularly and concede a few here and there as one might expect it doesnt seem unbalanced from my point of view but then i suppose i dont always expect it to work everytime just because i want it to and rather i work on my tactics to make them more effective secondly a couple of other reviews complain about the new confusing layout while i admit i had a hard time finding certain things initially within the sidebar it really doesnt take long to get used to it and indeed i actually rather like the new look this game takes the solid foundations set by football manager 2014 as a huge improvement over the problematic 2013 version and builds on it it gives a fresh new look which isnt something i would have said it needed but now its here i like it in summary then from my own personal experience this game is very good indeed it improves in subtle ways on the previous entry in the series and from what ive seen so far it doesnt really take anything away either make of this what you will those people who complain might disagree with me but then im not from the school of instant success or gtfo buy it if you are a fan of the series i picked it up for a little over 20 and id say for the amount ill play it that makes it the bargain of the year

i have bought this franchise every year religiously since it very first came out this is the first year i have felt cheated out of my money where to start the new side bar makes things complicated for no reason whatsoever the old system was fine and didnt need changing it might just be me but the whole feel of the game has a far more fake feel about it while at the same time trying to add an unnecessary amout of realism i know this is a game but i somehow felt more connected to players and staff in the old one then you get to the matches the worst part of the game however is the god awful match engine the players look like chickens with flapping arms opposition goalkeepers appear to be the lovechild of neuer and buffon whereas mine has all the ability of a paraglegic my defnders seem to think that marking from corners means marking the corner of the six yard box and not moving and the guys on the posts are superglued there i took charge of manchester united incredible attack and i added well too yet my team had no answers to the might of the mls teams on tour pre season i went back over these games tried various formations and even went as far as using the in game editor to make all my players level20 on everything and still we were soundly beaten this seems to be a big flaw from other reviews i have read too as does the crazy scorelines i managed to pull off a 76 win over southampton with their cb scoring a hattrick from corners due to afforementioned problems and another fabulous 85 win over qpr after being 40 up and going behind 45 it has so many issues right now it is just not worth the outlay top and bottom if you have fm14 do not buy this game udpade the players and enjoy as it is superior to this in every way

surprised by the amount of bad reviews i havent experienced the vast amount of injuries and high score lines admittedly ive had a few high scoring games but ive also seen my fair share of 00s there are some good little improvements with manager creation more interaction with players and knockon effects to other players and the squad overall is it groundbreaking no but i dont think any fm game has been particulary groundbreaking over the past few years again there are some good improvements and additions to the game and if you have enjoyed previous fm games youll enjoy this one too

this is literally the worst football manager game ever made i know its just the beta but it is still  your players get injured all the time and is out for weeks maybe months there is about 56 goals every freaking game and your players complain about little playtime after just one game on the bench also where is the bench were you set up your team before the game and how do you click your players onto the field and bench without dragging them over another players position the real game have to improve by 100% to make this a good game because right now it sucks wake up you tried to make it more realistic and you managed to send the game back to the stone age well done

major upgrade over 14 love the new animations the new tactics screen and the match engine as a whole is a significant step up from 14 those who say otherwise are the type of impatient people who dont spend the time to perfect their tactics buy the game you wont regret it

6 hours into this game and i must admit they really improved the game a lot game looks better and feels better with the new layout and the ingame matches are much more fluent and nicelooking compared to the earlier match engines i usually spent 500 hours each year on football manager games and this will be no different game looks massively good runs perfect even though i have a huge database with 13 countries and 34 leagues well done si update i am now 36 hours into the game and i stand by my original review the game is amazing and really addicting and thus far i havent really experienced any bugs fantastic game

this is way better than football manager 14 where you had to get a perfect start for your club or get sacked within a couple of months ive played so many games and havent been sacked by cellino yet

best way to waste time without spending money on cosmetic items to satisy digital cravings to look cool 1110  ign but really new ui better but different takes some getting used to injuries are a little over the top and excessive so id like to see this get fixed or at least toned down seriously though its been a couple of times that i havent even been able to reach the third game of a season without a little more than a third of my team being injured for more than 2 weeks cmon si cut us some slack scouting is actually useful still a lot of fun to make fun of other managers too theres this thing now called team talk during a match where you can talk to your whole squad besides the pep talks doesnt do much but its there keepers are dumb and rebounds happen on 90% of shots incredibly hard to sell players if you are new to football manager read the following i came from fifa playing as a single player got boring and online matches arent my thing and i wanted a deeper manager experience so i tried out fm14 and i became addicted its a hell of a lot of fun managing a football club with this much detail and there are so many clubs to choose from that its very possible but kind of hard to make a ragstoriches story with either a single club or your management career if youre okay with the shallow managing of fifa then you do that no hard feelings its not like im on the development team if you are not new to football manager read the following id say this is worth it over fm15 even in the beta state its in as of me typing this just about everything is improved except for the amount of injuries that happen to your squad just be prepared to be fumbling around with the new ui for a bit as you get used to it trust me its a better cleaner ui ps this is a review of the beta so i should be updating this periodically one more thing that applies to the beta and the full release when it comes out i really wish they could make this run in 64 bit as well as 32 bit 64 is becoming more and more common place and it would make the game run a hell of a lot faster id really like to see this implemeted in fm16

this is my first fm i have got on pc i have previously had it on hand held i find the game fun but it can be rather unrealistic i play a game and there might be 78 goals in a game its ridiculous i find it very fustrating i also find that signing players is to hard this could be that i am just new to fm and just not very good but all the clubs seem to want 4 times the players value hope there will be an update soon

i love it but then again i love the tactical and the behind the scenes running of a football club and obviously it is one of if not the the best football managerment simulator on the market i have seen a lot of people complaining about bugs but in general i rarely get the bugs that people get in games on computer and console i havent had a problem with it yet after 52 hrs played there are features it could add to further improve it but still great game that can still improve only thing i could think of as a problem would be some of the unrealistic scorelines i beat liverpool 71 on the opening day as man united and as much as i hate liverpool i dont think they should be getting beat 71 especially when i hadnt even a full strenght team out

amazing game worth the buy

great game with amazing detail hard to learn how to play well but a season as a manager should solve that
recommended
this game has its ups and downs leading me to an inconclusive decision whether it is the best yet to me the match engine is unrealistic the goalkeepers dont get me started on the gks seem to save the first and then be nowhere for the rebound ive resorted to the classic 2d match engine so i dont have to painfully see these mistakes being made if you want a prospect youre going to need the capital as many enquiries i get come back with 57m which no one is going to pay for a 16 year old although this being said it does make it more realistic in that aspect overall its an improvement and linked together with the steam workshop it gives players a chance to post their tactic of dominance in which other players can then implement into their game all the issues ive stated can be patched up
recommended
the most realistic version yet to real life football i have played every version of the fm franchise and this is the best yet im looking forward to the next installment of the fm franchise im currently using the barclays premier league swapped with the conference northsouth by kingpazza goldenfm as i think its the best database on the steam workshop and well with checking out

this is the 2nd time i have decided to give a review of this game my first review i gave a negative review out of frustration down to the game keep crashing however after uninstalling and reinstalling and giving it a good go i have decided to change my review to a more positve review under reviewal though im not sure i can wholeheartedly give this a 100 pcnt positive review so mid writing this review ive reviewd my decision to review 610 not enough progression from previos versions for me

this is a very simple review gameplay good and is better than previous fms reliability very poor crashes a lot have now loast 3 save games due to gameside crashes recommendation stick with fm14  the loss of save games even when doing rolling saves is very annoying the new menu system is a bit weird and not exactly simple to find things had way more fun on fm14

rediculously addictive but not without flaws like the previous release fm2015 tends to be unstable on anything other than windows ive had limite success with home streaming the interface is a bit clunky and workflow in team management isnt entirely intuitive that said im enjoying the hell out of 2015 if 1 you know that football doesnt involve touchdowns and helmets 2 you know that a football is round and usually kicked not eggshaped and usually thrown 3 you know your 433 from your 4231 from your 352 from your 442 diamond 4 teams are built not bought 5 are masochistic enough to enjoy a management simulation then you will love this edition of the most famous sport management simulation on the planet you know a game has made it into the public consciousness when a common insult when discussing tactical elements of the real sport is an accusion of being a keyboard manager that only knows football manager

paid 30 for the game it wont even start as soon as i click play i get a serious error fm2015v1521 message i tried looking for support on the communitysigames page but their website didnt give me permission to look at the fix pages saying i needed an account with their website i looked on the sega website for support again it didnt give me permission to open their fix pages im sure the games fine but the severe lack of support and customer service not to mention the many other people that appear to have the same problem means i have to give a thumbs down

i just dont understand i have played fm 2013 quite regulary its not perfect but its accessible i have always made light of the match engine yes it has its problems but it has never angered me to the point that i feel its actively working against me fm 2015 has some really unique in depth features compared to fm 13 more events happen between players prematch build up and the scouting system feels much more accurate the problem i am having here is that i dont think i have really played enough to review the game i just know that i have played enough to not reccomend it to anyone match preperation was a great part of the game yet my formations are never trained enough in preseason even with a very high workload i wouldnt mind if this also applied to the teams i am not in control of it is entirely evident though that this is not the case with time i think i could become invested in this game however the turmoil of early game problems has led me to return to an earlier version of the game for my fm fix just go and play an earlier version and save yourself the trouble edit after spending several more hours i simply cant get into this game theoretically the more accurate aspects of this years release should create a better fm experience yet this is simply not the case the plethora of new tactical roles just bemuddles the overall system i really question if even half of these are used frequently in the real life game especially outside of the top flight of leagues i think overall enjoyment has been sacrificed on the altar of depth if you want a tactical system which requires constant maintenance and player recruitment which takes hours of trawling through players and weeks upon weeks of scouting reports i could possibly reccomend this game over previous releases also the new interface is absolutely shocking luckily the workshop provides some good alternatives
not recommended
there arent much changes from 13 i didnt purchase 14 because i knew there wasnt gonna be some huge updates and changes sigames merely refined the game and touched up on some areas in 2015 they tried to shift the reliance of fmscoutgenie by allowing us to scout for potential and consistency of players but the scouting ui system is terrible imagine scouting over 200300 players and after the initials reports those players who didnt make the cut you will have to remove them one by one manually genie is still the choice for me its just too convenient it was refreshing for maybe the first few days after that you will realise its actually the same old thing being repackage with some minor tweaks and improvements buy it if you are a real diehard football or fm fan if not just stick to your 1314

i had this sitting on my wishlist for more than a month before i decided to risk everything and buy it i was hoping to get it on sale but i got so bored with my other games i couldnt wait any longer being a long time player of the ea fifa manager series now discontinued and a one time player of fm years ago and read all the recent bad reviews i thought i was going in with my eyes open i knew what i wanted in a football manager game and this one just didnt deliver  particularly on the matchday experience everything was cool to begin with having to go for job interviews to get a manager gig etc i thought that was unique the whole build up to match day was good choosing tactics and formations etc its all very very detailed i was quite happy to tinker for hours before i decided to plough through to a friendly match then i was presented with the most godawful ui for match day and a 1980s 3d rendition of a football match which i eventually turned it 2d mode because i couldnt stand it for a game that has been around for how long this 3d match engine is appalling they would be much better off just having a text ticker for gameplay rather than a halfa55ed attempt at a 3d game engine i hated the interface for actual match play way too much clutter nothing intuitive you could only have 1 or 2 widgets up and running at a time it really hasnt been thought out well i wish i could take the ui and match engine from fifa manager and plug it into this  it would be much more appealing to me sigh another wasted $50 they do refunds around here update ironically within hours of this review it went on sale in steam aaaaaaarghhhhh

i am a long time player of fm and with so many negative reviews i had some hesitations with this title bought it though on the recent 33% discount offer so far i find it better than fm2014 i guess it has been patched because i didnt encounter any of the problems other players are complaining about useless goalkeepers lags and craches lots and lots of injuries crazy score lines etc visually speaking the 3d simulation of the game is in my opinion the best so far for this game but you should keep in mind this is not fifa keep in mind though that im not able of saying if the simulation reflects or not the tactical orders given to the players what i dislike most is the lack of team logos when you are asking 50 euros for each new installement at least you could get the proper rights to use the real logos

football manager 2015 is a manager simulation game which is designed to put you in charge of teams within the footballing world you can buysell as you please as well as hirefire staff as you please and you ride the highs and lows of football management if youve played the older versions of this game this game is a slight improvement upon them this version has added extra features and improvements which most are very much in the background truth be told the same issues with the preivous versions still exist in this version to a certain extent such as the ai at times in rare cases is very frustrating and downright poor ai issues have been adressed in the latest update but much like many other games the orignal version was released unfinishedunpolished much like the fifa franchise this game slightly improves elements such as graphics and adding one or two features which in my opinon is unacceptable there is alot of potentail and the creators should look to improve much more such as the match engine and overall mediaplayer interaction to be more positive the game is fun challengeing and does feel like an improvement the match engine is getting better and the accuracy of transfers between clubs is better however the next version must have significant improvement in order to prevent the franchise from becoming stale for football fans who enjoy the small details involed with football and would ratrher be at the helm of a club rather than a player this game is for you overall an addictive game and a slight improvement and a solid edtion to a franchise with high potential 610 upon release 8510 latest update

where to startits a fantastic game just like the previous however this one adds a bit more immersion with the team talks for example i was 10 down to hull at halftime with west ham i drilled into the lads and as it happens with got the equalizer howeer i wanted more i wanted the 3 points to pursue the league title i clicked the team talk tab and aggressiely demanded more from the lads and out of nowhere mark noble with a fantastic volley from a corner rattled it home giving me a 21 win at the end of the day if youre an fm fanatic why havent you bought this and if youre looking for a new challenging strategy game and you have an undying love for football then look no further and purchase this beauty and get into it as i can guarentee you the next one will be better and more advanced

tldr a yes i you like a slight improvement on fm10 with new skins and stuff but still not really a whole new game if you dont mind paying 12 for the experience then do so paying 25 isnt worth it for me fm13 just as good as this for me but maybe theyve improved the long term it seems theyve improved the big money on poor performing players so far though well this is my review after 4 seasons and 69 hours in maybe i should wait to write this review as im only a few seasons in yet it still seems like a slight update on fm10 i think the only improvemant ive really ever looked for after fm1011 is the long term play with previous games when you got up to 10 years there seemed to be no big players regenning and teams making stupid purchases then selling those stupid purchases on the cheap i skipped 14 as i saw no point in paying new game prices for a dlc oh and im one of those bought every game since cm2 players i got fm15 on the cheap which is the only reason i bought it also i dont play in 3d so my opinion is purely gameplay and not graphics 2015 has slight improvements but still falls back on the same old annoyances youre flying high and beating everyone but if you come against a bottom 3 team expect a loss but not a 10 or 21 itll be a 4 thrashing yes i know it happens in real life but a guarenteed 6 loses no matter what you do is unrealistic i expect thats football comments but it shouldnt be for 6 games of the year against bottom 3 whipping boys its also guarenteed your top players will get below 6 ratings in these games i play as small clubs and bring them up the leagues in the lower leagues the teams towards the bottom suddenly act like they are playing a big team in a cup game the goalie thats leaked 50 goals in 12 games stops every shot the strikers that have 4 goals between seem like ronaldo and messi then at the opposite end when you get to the premiership your small club which is playing well comes up against a struggling top team youll lose by 6 but again apparently thats football if liverpool man uc or arsenal will destroy you regardless much like the bottom 3 in other leagues and the problem still exists with you raining down 20 shots on target against a poor team then when you finally score 15 minutes later the oppostion will immediatley score the press still ask the same crap questions confidence is high etc and the people demand a response on your thoughts about a nothing subject i skipped a game year and these questions are still repetitive and pointless when i thought theyd been sorted out also managers can seemingley diss you now and you have no way of responding if tony pulis says im a poor manager who is arrogant and my team doesnt deserve the plaudits it gets i should be able to respond maybe im not looking hard enough for a tab to respond to him but at the moment i cant find it there could be so much more added on that part of the game so often as the smaller team fighting my way up the leagues ill throw a big contract at youngster or a loan offer then the response will be your team isnt good enoughgoing anywhere the next season ill find myself against his team if i beat them or im at the top of the table and they are at the bottom i shouldnt be able to have a dig which could result in his morale boosting or dropping i cant seem to find a the old tab of comment on next opposition instead of this you get asked about a youth player who left the oppostion when he was 17 returning to play his former team and how their fans will react even though he was there a season and never played for them also something thats not been improved is players getting annoyed at you i signed a player that was immediatley injured and out for 2months when he returned i eased him in and he got injured in training and was out again for a few more weeks he came back and before i could even ease him in he got injuredin training so the next time he came back i eased him in again and he immediatley complained i wasnt giving him chancei tried to reason that he was coming back from injusry he disagreed that i hadnt put him straight in to the first teamhe was signed on a backup contract i started him in the next game and he got injured he still wasnt happy i wasnt starting him when he came back this also happens with any backup players seemingly i know im here as backup but i feel i should be starting they are coming on as subs starting cup game and getting games when needed but thats not good enough even though they were signed as back up and agreed to this role this happened in previous games especially with the injured playing complaining about not been involved to sum up i really wish there was a neutral reccomend button i dont feel this deserves a no but i also dont feel its improved enough or maybe ive played enough to give it a yes like many youll probably see me go well over a few 100 hours if i get to season 10 and new players are coming through ill come back and say but as of now i see no major improvements on fm13 just tweeks i got bored in fm13 after trying to improve scotland singlehandedly winning everything and winning the world cup apparently did nothing the one advantage of playing in scotland was the bottom 3 thing and small club against big clubs didnt seem to happen maybe its just the english league that has that problem so i might give that a go if i get bored in fm15 i defintley wont be gettin 16 or 17 as again i heard there were launch problems with this one

fantastic game

football manager 2015 is a must for all football fans it enables you to do what it says on the title manage a football team the game itself has been majorly improved from football manger 2014 with the simulation looking crisperwith that being said i expect the simulation of the pitch looking better although it has been improved the graphics are poor but if you arent to bothered it then its all well and dandy for people that are new to this series you dont have to look at the pitch setting you can easily turn it to 2d mode which is good having clocked nearly 190 hours on this game since christmas day i have clearly enjoyed this game in the 4 months i have owned it and would recommend this game to all fans of football and people who like strategy type games if i had to rate it i would give it an 8 out of 10 the game is enjoyable yet can addictive at the same time which could lead you to playing this for hours and hours enjoy the game

recommend to new players of the series having owned 0912 and now 15 there does not seem that much diff between the games if you own any of the others just play them granted im not a die hard fan and i wont pick up on all the issues or every little changes but from what ive read about 15 is that the match engine has been re done and tbh its a frustrating mess to watch goal keepers might as well not be there for most of the match as they rarly make a save to see you defender stand still rather than chasing a ball is a quite a highlight and ive punched my leg on many occasions in anger also to see the other team engage superspeed and collect the ball after running from 3 times more distance than you defender had to run  also ending up with a leg punch i think for the price and the selling point by now the matchday engine should look like your watching a fifa match injurys kind of make this game unplayable at times as they happen a lot and before you know it you struggle to field a starting 11 when you are a small team with a low wage budget would like a option to turn them off as for me it ruins the game play factor guess i will wait a few more years before getting the next edition but overall i will recomend as a manager game but beware this game will bruise your legs if you have a short fuse like me

good game this series is great to play if you live the series then you will love this one too

highly addictive game if you smoke 10 a day expect to be smoking 20 a day when you are playing this game possibly easier to quit smoking than this game 
recommended
quite possibly one of the best and most complete fm games ive played in a few years some of the recent entries to this series have been dire and have done little to try and move forward but fm15 feels fresh and easy to use even when navigating complex menus in such a thorough and detailed career mode highly recommended

do not buy this game otherwise your life will end and you will enter a parallel universe where you can win the champions league with accrington stanley and sign messi on a free contract at the tender age of 36 i cant turn this game off and it has broken my space bar 1010

this is a perfect game for any football addict if you love football this games for you so realistic makes you feel like your managing the team for real but its only a game it has every key feature you need to be a manager you can adjust finances and acctually interact with your players may not be the cheapest game in the world but defenetely worth it i cant wait for fm16 and i cant imagine how much better itll be football fan get this game
recommended
i hate football and group sports yet somehow i love this game very good game if you are into numbers money statistics managment and strategy games  even if you hate sport this is just amazing and totally unexected for me bad things  you cant start with empty team and staff or create your own non real team suprise of the year 910

top eleven was my introduction to football sim i really liked the concept but always wanted to do more well football manager delivers i always go in thinking ill only play one week worth of games but stick around for hours the only complain that i have is the fact the fact that players always want to leave because im not matching their ambition we just got promoted twice show some loyalty hahaha but thats what happens in real life doesnt it highly recommend it to those fifa players that try to play career mode but its not enough
recommended
addicting too addicting sat down and played for 10 hours straight ugh

definatly recomend it has everything you want in a football managing simulation game even the transfers are realistic and hard to do

free weekend review i have been playing this series since the 2011 version buying the game every year but also you can see that my playtime has decreased a lot year to year i played only 2 hours with this one but god injuries are bigger issues then they were back in 2014 every match someone gets injured from my team every match no they do not go out for 23 days nooo they go out for weeks 4 weeks minimum and the same crap is happening just like in 2014 top training facilites top coaches best players from the world real madrid with lots of money low training load and they get injured every month in training sprint session u fukin wot m8 avoid this buy it when its 75% or more

so i have been playing this game ever since it started at number 1 2015 is a terrible game to play there is nothing you can do with your tactics or your team training everybody knows in real life not one club spends a whole week going tackling its more like a day when you tell your team to close down and mark tighter nothing happens to play every game with the same system is virtually impossible one match you will have guys marking the posts but the next game they are not there sega have spoiled what was once a good game this game is dire
not recommended
this is a really good game for people who like very indepth and detailed strategic games but i dont recommend this game to people who think this is a simple game like fifa or pes where you dont need to put any effort into being a manager
recommended
downloaded the weekend trial started a game with nice to see if the injuries are really as bad as they say i had my doubts in my first match with my reserve team there were three players on my squad that were injured two of them for about a week each and the third was out for about 3 weeks injuries are really as bad as they say i know that one match isnt a large sample size but with three injuries against my reserve team i dont feel like wasting anymore time its a shame because i buy these games on an almost yearly basis this years doesnt make the cut

a little bit too expensive but worth it

this version of football manager surprised me in a good way the match mechanics are a lot improved contrary to other peoples reviews there is a lot less goalkeeper fumbling and also the matches run a lot more smooth and fluid instead of being very choppy i think the little subtle touches they have added actually make quite a big difference the only negative is the 48 month later buy still works which does kind of break the game a little all in all still a great buy 810

well my hours shows alot can be improved  database needs to be relooked and rechecked  tons of inaccuracies birthdays and heights etc  aimatch engine needs major improvements especially player movements there should be more hurrah and more deep sense of achievement whenever your club wins something besides the basic news printoutinterviews maybe include playerfans tweets open bus celebration players own postmatch interviews tabloidfootball media should be more humorous and should do more indept analysis of matches overall those a just a few flaws that can be improve 7810

dont know why people moan theyve been moaning since domark did cm2 on the amiga everton overpowered supertactics free transfer glitch man marking keepers to score 70 goals a season now its not enough changed keep your knickers on loads has changed like a full seasonal update for one just like next years will do the same you know what you are going to get with yearly titles especially sporting ones if you want radical changes youre playing the wrong game even so fm is one of the few sporting games out there that tries to implement new features in the last 1012 years weve had match engines agents ffp more leagues media player interactions numerous training revamps tactical overhauls now go play fifa 20089 and see if much has changed there is a reason some games dont change their gameplay that much its because its good

i plan to tell people the 500 hours ive put into this game so far is because we had a baby and when im not taking care of him i dont exactly go out and party or do anything really the truth is though my baby is only five days old i really just cant stop playing this game you can do anything even when i somewhat get bored and decide to go find some other sports manager game i always fall back to well it looks cool but it doesnt have everything that fm has and ive already made a career on fm and and things are going well i just want to see whats next classic mode is basically the mobile version in my opinion which i also own it doesnt offer nearly the depth as normal i usually start a save with one team but by about 4 years in im controlling a number of head coaches most of which i like to start uunemployed and work my way up the lower leagues when i started playing i would always pick the top tier teams to start but the games richness really come from battling it out in the trenches of some random countrys pyramid with players who make less money in a two week period than i do there is also no better feeling than when your 16 year aold wonderkid regen grows into a well groomed goal scoring machine and helps win a world cup for his country leads your team to the champions league or sells for a $150m even though it hurts your feelings to sell him the only thing i would comment almost negatively about is the ingame editor its not even a negatve really because its awesome and if you really want to get the ball rolling on a team and have a dominating season quickly move someone to your club you cant afford or turn a no potential regen into a wonder kid its very easdy to do so thats the only negative comment be careful with the editor because youll get too good too quick and get bored when there is no one better to buy its also very hard to stop using once you started thats all 1010 from my experieces with fm09 to date
recommended
fantastic addition to the game chain
recommended
i honestly hate this game so much the ingame mechanics are so unrealistic like the defender just stares at the person running by them and they defend so horribly i defend better than these defenders also the opposition goalkeepers are so overpowered like wtf my player is 2 meters from the goal and the goalkeeper flys from the other side of the goal and grabs it once welbeck shot from the other side of the goal and de gea just teleported to the other side and caught it in real life it would have been a 100% goal this game would be a million times better if it was more realistic ingame

played about 20 hours now pretty good solid engine and also very addictive cant stop playing it once you get the right tatic the game turns completely different as you will be winning alot of games totally recommend this game 810

played fm14 before and will gladly stick to 14 longshots and headers dominate in this edition with possessionbased tactics falling by the wearside to be replaced by routeone and direct stuff the match engine is ridiculously inaccurate and keepers are as good as an u12 sunday league keeper wish i never spent full retail price on fm15 hopefully patches balance it out

not recommended
pretty good so far i have been a devotee since fm 2010 and buy this every year i never really got into fm 2014 but so far i am liking fm 2015 the high score line games is a bit of a bug but it is being worked on so i dont doubt soon enough games will revert to more sensible score lines the new interface is really good and very easy to navigate and the overall appearance of the game is attractive at this point it still is a little buggy but i would think in due course it will be sorted out and will be a solid addition to the fm line up

really dont understand how the me gets worse 2012 was ok just needing a bit of tweaking 2013 onwards have been shocking with the latest being the worst i fully understand that fm is a management simulator and that si will say it isnt meant to be fifaesque in terms of graphics etc but that isnt my gripe the major issue i have with the me is what you see happening in no way relates to your instructions or the stats at the end for example you concede too many from balls over the top so you set the team to defend deeper but when you are viewing the match the back four are still in the halfway line what is the point in having the facility to change something if the me doesnt reflect that change same with ratings a keeper drops one into his own net then kicks a ball stright to the opposition to score his rating is a 7 from what i see he is at fault for two goals yet if i discipline or drop him he thinks its unwarranted as the stats say he played well nothing you see happening relates to stats some of the interplay is laughable world class players look like baby deer trying to kick a ball and the decision making completely at odds with what players especially good ones would do in those situations only real benefit of th game its updated database aside from that its a poor imitation of previous versions save your money

great game to all you complaining about it you just need to perfect your tactics instead of expecting to win every single game from the word go loving everything about it

better than 2014 a lot loving it

i have been reading through the reviews for this game yet i cant understand how people have said how rubbish they thing this new release is of course its going to have some bugsfaultsissues with the game as soon as it comes out just like any other pc game you buy none are perfect as soon as theyre released due to companies being pushed to release their games quicker so that they ensure they make a fast profit you just need to be patient like i was once the bugs were fixed and it was all how it was supposed to be this is a really good game probably the best one out of the fm series yet due to you have to actually scout and search for certain player that you wantneed instead of their being a huge list of transfer listed players available so its hit and miss on whether you get bargains or you end paying the full price which is extrememly realistic the 3d graphics have been improved making it more realistic on the pitch especially with the new team talk feature allowing you to shour specific instructions to your team the only downside is that sega have yet again tried and failed with the media i started of as a conference north team chorley fc yet i have press conferences before and after every game surely a team that has only just made it to the conference north shouldnt be having this many press conferencestunnel interviews if they havent even been fully estabilished by anyone hardly it just makes it seem like they havent put much thought into the media overall i am pretty much on this game all the time now its extrememly addicting i would advice anyone to purchase this plus 30 for a pc game is nothing these days bargain

i have played fmcm since 2001 and this honestly is the worst one i cant understnad why si would release a game thats not finished other than miles jackobsons inapt abillity to ajust i waited a few weeks to buy the game after seeing lots of negatives about it but thought it cant be that bad  well unfortunately it is i dont know where to start the graphics are terrible and cartoon like i have a top spec pc amdfx8350 radeon r9 series graphics the injurys are beyond a joke im getting 3 or 4 serious injurys every game the oi tactic screen doesnt work which is a joke said screen is now on the tactics tab but when you set the oi it doesnt do anything in the game build up beacuse you have to renter the oi anyway before the team talk you cant adjust the finances and budgets anymore why remove it seriously and little things like tac files can no longer be applied to the game i hate to say it but this is a step back not a step foward for fm im so dissapointed

unsure on which way to swing with this game its good but so broke in saying that though 14 was broke up until january what annoys me about this game is how awful your goalkeeper becomes when your 10 up with 10 mins left the amount of games ive drew or lost being 10 up with 10 mins left is unreal but because i have faith in si id say buy it but when its in a sale or something cause 30 is far too much for a game that is still broken

terrible just keeps checking and scanning for updates when i try and click play game then i end up back on this page tried to uninstall steam and install the game by itself but cannot do this any more when i could actually play the game i consistently had 56 players injured tried to do too much and ruined the game needs some patches big toime

i would recomend it its only got a few problems which i dont mind about every game as problems at first i dont seem to have the problem with injuries i play with carlisle united and doing quite well 2 in leaugue had one player injured in 15 games and one sent off its good ive played these games since they came out love it each year i enjoy

i see a lot of negative reviews here some even from experienced fm players to be honest really experienced players dont seriously play fm until final patch  that one with winter transfer updates which also usually fixes all unwanted stuff like injuries corners woodwork oneonones and other weird things devs did to ruin gameplay they do it every year btw youll see the pattern if you continue to play fm  its almost a tradition just remember that football manager until the final patch is a public beta and youll be ok as for the game itself i played one season so far and enjoyed it there were too much injuries but it can be considered as a challenge also rotation and young players were extremelly happy to replace crippled first team members there were too much woodwork but several fms back it was much worse there were some nice goals and dramatic matches overall it was typical football manager experience  not ideal but quite enjoyable match engine improved a lot  much less scripted goals much more goal diversity my player even won goal of the month award  thing i cant remember since introducing 3d match engine still we have a lot of morale goals during 4648 min period but i guess itll never change anyway you can have some fun with fm15 or die from a rage attack your choice tldr try it but starting longterm careers until patch 153 is out is unadvisable

its wierd at first and the default skin is terrible but after a few hours into it you start to get used to it scouting is actually allot more important than ever now and you go into your scouting tab in order to search for players that are transfer listed etc based on your scouting knowledge you can see how everything is working allot more now and makes it important to have feeder clubs from different countries to improve scouting knowledge across the globe touchline instructions are cool in theory but i found it to be pointless and makes your team worse off just stick with the pre match and half time team talks match engine is allot better and it feels more fluid with the animations however are there some dodgy stuff that happens especially when 2 or 3 defenders are trying to chase down a loose ball then none of them end up getting it and leave it whilst a surging striker latches onto it and scores when they shouldent of had any chance of getting it the only bad thing really for me is the default skin but thats a personal thing as for the game its solid and a solid upgrade if youve not got a fm game for a while then deffo pick this up if you get them every year then you should see more improvements this year than you have the previous years to warrent getting it aswell

i have enjoyed my time so far as acmilan manager within fm2015 it is a game that like 2014 ramped up the difficulty and you have to have a team throughly prepared you also have to be very careful in what you say not only to the players but to the media morale has an impact in the games like 2014 and long streaks of losses can be brought on if you are not up to the mark in man management there are some dodgy goal keeper animations that often cause goals rare off the wall scorelines and often times follow up conversations with players that dont quite relate to the previous conversation but they are not exactly game breakers the game has brought in a much more streamlined interface that i have found a very welcome addition i have always found the news an irritaion and have waited for the return of how 2010 had the headlines away from the inbox and i have found 2015s way much more to my liking the game is very enjoyable and one of the few that often has me making noises when goals are missed or penalties given it is nice to get that sort of immersion setting up your profile as manager and being able have coaching stats and ratings to use in game are great finally running the training yourself will have a greater effect i really like it the positives outweight the negatives by a long way and have found it the most enjoyable fm since 2010 the game engine is good the management detail is fantastic the scouting has been revamped i like the uncertainty brought in with vague ratings eg passing 1619 i like that teams try very hard to hold onto their good players for example i found a future star according to all my scouts his value was below 1mil but the team he was with knew what i did and would only sell him for 42mil i recommend it its worth every penny for the management fan or football fan alike

sensationally good game following in the footsteps of its predecessors the genius of its improvements are in the constant simplification of its features which makes it equally accessible to either hardcore football fans casual gamers or indeed both

this i my first time buying and playing a fm game i usually play fifa on ps4 however this is a breathe of fresh air love the layout and how you actually have to think unlike fifa or pes coop is awesome and great with friends would definetly recommend and i will be buying future ones for sure wonderful game

dont be put off by all the helpful negative reviews they were made when it was still in betajust after beta the game is very good and i have found it to be the most enjoyable game yet the 3d match engine has been slightly imporved players do skills back heels and the layout is just aesthetically pleasing

ive been a cmfm player since cm 0001 so i think in can say it with some property fm is a great football managing game always were and still is but this year beta edition was totally flawed literally broken as of beta 1503 most of those bugs were solved now i had only observed a few bizarre defensive errors and some excessive red cards but i can safely say that this game will be proper in the release date good job si there was some good additions as the rpg like feature to estipulate your manager skils and the possibility of team talking during the matches not only in half or full time also i liked the new scouting system its not only more beautiful and easier to adapt as it seens to be more effective the tactical screen was also improved its now more reallistic and fluid with some nice additions to the tactical options ill list the main bugs that affected this game until the beta 1503 and update their situation as si realizes the patches all of them i observed in all my 3 saves playing in spanish italian and brazilian leagues propositaly with top clubs real madrid juventus and cruzeiro  lots of goals bizarre gk and defensive errors lots of own goals this was totally adressed in the 1503 update there still some keeper and defensive errors but most of them seems acceptable as this is a football simulation game still there are very few defensive errors especially with wingfull backs that seems a bit unrealistic  iconstancy long winning and losing streaks without apparent motives as ive said im propositaly playing with top clubs so as of beta 1503 im experiencing long winning streaks with some unlucky draws and some loses to stronger teams something closer to what one can expect playing with these teams  bizarrely high frequency of yellow and red cards 34 or 5 reds in one game all games of the round having red cards this seems to have been adressed but still happens sometimes i know some football games tend to be very violent but having 3 red cards in two games of the same round in the spanish league it still seems fishy to me  excessive player transfers demands and team meetings this also seems to be adressed players now seem more mature as when to ask for a transfer and of when to call a team meeting but there still some bugs as when llorente asked me a new contract and i promised to give him one in the end of the season he accepted but the next day he was mad at me because i didnt agreed with a new contract straight away and called a team meeting of course or when one of the younger players asked me for a transfer in the very first day after the window closed and not adressing your players demands severely hinder their morale and their performances now  i still dont like the ui but i guess ill just have to adapt to it this game now is totally playable and im pretty sure that si will manage to correctly patch him untill the release date a must buy for all football fans as always

its a good enough game it does have its issues though the pinnacle of management games for me was championship manager 0304 i preferred the pricing of players and they eventually become disgruntled if left out of the team this game though ive left a player on the bench for maybe the first two or three games of a season only for him to immediately complain about not being in the team it wouldnt be so bad if you could actually get away with a squad of 16 players but injuries are a big problem i had one match were three of my players got injured in it so its ridiculous trying to please the game when you need a big squad but the players complain instantly about it without giving you much chance of rotation or they complain even if you do rotate the fees every club expects for transfers is also ridiculous your club can barely shift the players for half their value yet you try and buy someone and get milked dry for example i went to purchase john stones yes hes a good player with great potential but they were instantly expecting 50 million and shifted no lower that 42 million for a cash only deal now i had a big club and a big budget but this was ridiculous in the end i parted with 30 million and a player who i no longer wanted who despite that was valued at 22 million the upsides of the game is that it doesnt always operate like that the injuries always come in bursts but you can get away with it throughout the season with good subbing and rotation the transfers can be better if you can be patient enough to play the game ive managed to force transfers by making a player unsettled and you can lower the fee although perhaps not that much in terms of real bargains you just need to keep checking the transfer market and id recommend shortlisting absolutely everyone you have the slightest bit of interest in the game seems to pick a small handful of players off your shortlist and put them up for great transfer bargains a big difference i noticed about this game is that if you play defensively and have great defenders and a great goalkeeper you dont actually concede many goals and unlike 2013 your worldclass goalkeeper doesnt run 40 yards out only to get chipped by a joe bloggs you also get a better return from your strikers and its more realistic in older games they were either scoring 5 goals a game or they wouldnt score for about 20 games before smashing in 20 goals in the remainder of the season id like to see more options added to the game the news reporter replies in this are only a slight change from 2014 and while you can control your budget its only by reducing your expenditure other than offloading players you cant do much to actually raise money or negotiate any sponsor deals you just have to leave that all to the club id also like the training to actually do more in terms of raising youth players stats while you can raise them if the player wasnt already set to be a wonderkid he doesnt improve at all and even if he was a wonderkid he often turns out mediocre i just feel the increase in stats is too slow it takes about one season to raise a handful of attributes up by perhaps 1 or 2 points and theyre likely to drop whenever they feel like it 710

never had a problem with years of fm from 2008 but fm 2015 will not work on my computer the sinc and graphics are not watchable and you cant keep track of ball or goals
not recommended
really worth it
recommended
my most played game within a few months says a lot about the game and me 1010
recommended
fantastic game well recommended
recommended
its fm you will play get frustrated and hate it then play again good times

i absolutly love football manager and have spent many hours ticking away the hours playing these games with fm15 the developers have reverted to the sidebar which foir me seemed a step in the wrong direction but after a few weeks of getting used to it its fine many hardcore fmers would argue it spoils the layout but this change i believe is a good one now to the game itself fm15 lets get the bad bits out of the wayi say bad its not that bad but the match engine is still in the finetuning stage from fm 13 which is the last fm i played it has been completly overhauled which in my opinion is a gamble but there is progress and its going forward allbeit slowlylets not mention the nearpost corner glitch and stupid idiotic backpasses that go out for a corner all that aside its a work in progress football manager is about progress not revolution which is arguably what its audience wants and exactly what this years game provides
recommended
ever get excited during a transfer window ever wanted to build and manage a world class team look no further another great tweeked version of fm
recommended
in spite of what people have said i would say this is a very intuitive and interesting addition to the series
recommended
my game keeps playing up giving the whole game different names every other day it does this not impressed
not recommended
i thought it would be a good idea to spend a fair amount of money on this game how wrong was i its just boring to play and sht i thought playing with my friends would make it a bit more fun yet again how wrong was i having to wait all the fuking time just for some cnt to press continue the gameplay is wnk poor graphics and not even real names of the clubs are used if you want to buy this game as something fun to play then dont its sht
not recommended
you can never go wrong with this game
recommended
it says its in my library and its not waste of money
not recommended
1010 would buy again
recommended
not much can i say except from this is the best game in the world
recommended
i have enjoyed this series for a long time
recommended
good but hasnt got the real badges or game faces
not recommended
only got this game yesterday and can i just say wow always thought of getting footal manager but thought it not going to be to much different to fifa career mode i am so wrong the levels of depth in the game is amazing ive problerly played quite a few hours and have only played 3 competitive games so far it takes a long time to set up and manage the team but will be worthwhile soon must reccomend this game 1010
recommended
in a month i couldnt go through a month of career without a gameruining bug this game is the worst buy i ever made i wish i demanded my money back in the first few days
not recommended
starting off i have played and enjoyed football manager games since fm 08 played a couple earlier editions with my dad a couple times but fm 08 was my first ever fm game this game is an absolute must have if you are a football fan especially if you enjoy the tactical side of the game as well personally i love the tactical side to football and i love creating new tactics creating and developing new clubs and making a whole new generation for the football club if you like this sort of thing with a hell of a lot more detail than a fifa career mode for example then this is a must have pros of this game  very detailed game ie you are able to manage the entire club in great detail  lots of possibilities you can take forest green rovers to the champions league if you really want d  very good training and scouting  the most realistic management game out there please note that these arent all of the pros these are just a few main ones that stick out feel free to comment anymore you see cons of this game  addicting  seriously prepare to end all contacts with everyone to play this game  some bugs in the match engine for example  goalkeepers and defenders are a stand out example it will frustrate you its mainly the corner defending that defenders struggle on it will annoy you  can be so frustrating > yet somehow addicting feel free to add any of your own cons too  thanks for reading i hope if youre reading this you found it helpful and maybe if you were considering buying this game i seriously hope i swayed you in favour of this game because trust me it is awesome thanks marshyy

won the champions league with rangers and my striker won the golden boot 3 seasons in a row 1110 would dream again
recommended
i play football manager series for 10 years just cant give it up too good for football funs
recommended
cant quite put my finger on what it is but fm2015 seems to have sucked most of the fun out of the game i fire it up and play for an hour and even though ive gotten used t the new gui im kinda bored im not even a footy fan so feel free to scoff at my review and so i dont care about transfers being up to date etc but even so ive racked up thousands of hours over the years playing fm including when the sw used to be called championship manager im more into the management especially the economical side of things turning around debtridden clubs etc the game is losing its way a bit i think maybe they are just trying to make it too accessible for new players whilst neglecting the strategy elements for their historic userbase
not recommended
football manager 2015 is gonna suck for people new to this type of game but if your experienced and know how to play it then you will know how to manage going through the whole setting up team and match sections
recommended
play on the macbook air 13 is very hot because cpu is hard working  hope this game drop spec for it
recommended
the refined game play that makes it the choice of couch managers worldwide has been further polished to maintain fm as the undisputed king of its genre
recommended
had no idea what i was doing fumbling around the interface seeing all the sports jargon got a contract with the worst team in china who were just about to be kicked out of the competition after giving them a motivating speech which ended up making them all feel demotivated they won 1010
not recommended
doing this for the xp
recommended
well i dont have to say much about our beloved fm its getting better and better every year some issues with the online game some times though i would recommend that we can call players for warm up in the game so if they play without warming up they might get injured or cannot run perfectly at the first few minutes this will give even more ingame action recommended if you like this style of games
recommended
got over 700 hours on record great game
recommended
this game has way too much dlc that was very obviously cut out of the game in order to charge more for it instead of allowing files to be modded in their directory it will be sold as a modding tool for the very low price of 5 dollars time to actually review the game if you love having lots of tabs and things to click on that are only there for viewing purposes and cannot be changed then this is the game for you tons of options that will never pay off and rarely have a meaningful impact the game is just in need of being stream lined or having more impactful decisions you are just a coach manager and little more
not recommended
very bad no much happens
not recommended
if this game could potato it would overpotato
recommended
i got this game 5 days ago and already have 75 hours played fair to say im addicted
recommended
i am sertant it hacked my youtube account
not recommended
010 it broke my screen and made me fail all my exams but i won the capital one cup so its all ok
recommended
personally i find the game a bit too complicated creating your own tactic and getting team instructions spot on is by no means easy
not recommended
fifa 15 is the simplistic version of fm15 who is worse at graphics than fifa 15 in fifa 15 u play the game at any dificulty in fm 15 u are just watching to the game so i should put 10 more euros for fifa 15 sry but i give 25
not recommended
fking piece of s of a game ridiculous injuries decimating squad yes smarta tried tweaking the training  guys just get injured and injured and injured had to call cuns up from u18 annoying and frustrating game just hammered city with west brom 40 then lost the whole team to injury wanted many times to punch my computer is how frustrating the gameplay is do not purchase
not recommended
wicked game
recommended
best of the series
recommended
good but not great 710
recommended
this game follows in its predecessors footsteps and adds ne features
recommended
fm15 very addictive but the players are still not that quite intelligent yet bumping into each other  kicking ball their team mates and stuff like that but i think its ok to play and stay up all night 810
recommended
tip if you are unable to win what seems like a winnable game vacation for one day
recommended
recommendation for every football fan 
recommended
re named all players on teams i lost too   dis game is dank as  1110
recommended
i havent played fm since the 08 so had a pretty tough beginner time with this one but after a day everything seems ok now i am surprised that i havent experienced the injury bug like a lot of people have been talking about in this patch the game overall was fantastic the only thing that  me off is the 3d match really hard to tell if the players got tackled or not sometimes it feels like the other players just purposely tackle ur players the ones whos about to receive the ball in the pelnaty area and nothing happens even the commentary doesnt say anything the models are just stupid sometimes they just stand in one place and let the opponents run passed them the goalkeeper never pick up the ball when they are supposed to overall a lot of things wrong with the 3d system hope they will develop in the next game
recommended
if you are a fan of football youll need to play this
recommended
hmm a well familiar players are too expensive to buy for an average club to buy
recommended
great game have been playing since the 9899 days of championship manager and always find the money to buy on release day better and better year on year a credit to the sports simulation world keep it going si games
recommended
great game doing this for the steam achievement but its so good to play on long flightstrain and a welcome break from fifa 15
recommended
best football manager simulator ever
recommended
fantastic management game indepth players club attributes ive played every football manager game and every year they get bettergreat game enginetho i dont use it i like to play with 2d classic modethousands of players to scout from around the globejust a few glitches there are a few bugs that need fixingbut this does not affect the gameplay in anywayoverall id give it 85 out of 10 fantastic footy management gamea must for the any football fanplease notesay goodbye to your freinds and family as you wont want to stop playing
recommended
brilliant game 9910
recommended
the same game as fm 14 but updated
recommended
910 as always 
recommended
i have been playing football manager as long as i can remember and i absolutely love this game but injuries are still a slight problem but apart from that i dont know how they could top this game
recommended
i love this game and have been playing it for around 12 years although i do enjoy this version there is still alot wrong with it the game day match engine is just not good enough and if it doesnt improve they should just revert back to the old days of watching circles run around the pitch the stats for your manager at the beginning mean nothing as i won promotion with sheffield wednesday and the following season i was outside the relegation zone and looking like staying up my objective was to fight against relegation and they still sack me additional to this i was making the team money this has happened to me twice with two seperate teams the stats i choose at the beginning were for a top manager and there is no way a team in that situation in real life would sack a top manager in that position the top clubs sign all the best players but these players would not be happy to be sat on the bench and not playing games at all just not realistic and the amount of injuries i am faced against at one point i had 8 of my first team players out for 2 months or more like i said i do like the game though and will continue to play the gaem i just hope our comments are heard and the game next year is better than ever and back to its origins at the top of the pile for its genre
recommended
its simply too fun sure it does have unrealistic results but at the other end it is just too enjoyable with friends or withot it is just too good
recommended
everything you would like from manager game only negative for me are some unrealistic transfer fees nothing else 910
recommended
great game perfect fit for football fans most enjoyed when played with friends
recommended
much better than last years version im not a massive fan of the interface though some menus arent easily accessible enough for new users all in all a quality game though
recommended
you manage a footballl team of your choice
recommended
amazing game really love the number of upodates and mods available for thsi game to truly customisable
recommended
brilliant game the best manager simulation out there at the minute however i feel it gets a bit boring after a few seasons  just my opinion
recommended
not the best version of this game but still as adictive as it always has been the main issue is the amount of injuries players get even for the slightest of knocks theyre out for months apart from that the rest of the game is fine
recommended
a brilliant game
recommended
great game
recommended
ok people who rate this game as bad well there people who need to stick to playing fifa yes playing 30 a year is annoying but there are improvments to the game that do make it worth it end of
recommended
really gg d
recommended
seriously bug after 15 minutes  all players in club change d wow
not recommended
i have always been a fan of fm since the days of cm therefore i may sound biased good its another new version of the fm series that have grown from strength to where they are right now the fact is that championship manager and fifa manager are no more in the market shows how strong the monopoly fm has on football management games bad the crash dumps are very frequent so i have to resort to saving the game before every game i hope that my save game never get corrupted overall this is akin to an addiction to crack cocaine you will just keep buying it every time it comes out the painful part is that how do you start all over again if you are very deep in your game im looking at you fm 16
recommended
fantastic best 1 yet to date 1010
recommended
this  is crack get some help
recommended
won the champions league the premier league and the fa cup in the same year with tottenham so realistic 1010
recommended
took over my life
recommended
brilliant game got to say im addicted to it at the moment as you can probably tell by how many hours ive played its quite difficult at times but i got walsall to win league 1 in my first season so im pretty happy
recommended
it is very good however it is not allowing me to buy anything  it keeps saying post error 1 and i find it very annoying

got the game on saturday lost about 17 hours in these past three days to the game abandoned all social obligations trying to get leeds united to the premier league currently sitting comfortably in 8th place in the championship at around january havent been this addicted to an fm like this before i wont stop until i get leeds up or i get sacked 1010 feeling sleep deprived yet slighlty content with my efforts in the game liam marching on together
recommended
if you are comfortable with the rest of the world thinking there is something wrong with you for being so serious about being a fake manager then this game is definately for you have played this series since forever and each year it just gets better
recommended
love this game also have had hours of fun well worth the money
recommended
got southport from the conference to the championship then got sacked because my player of the year wanted to leave to bloody stoke kicked up a fuss and got his move fans and bored angry at little old me and i lose my job i nurtured this player i made him what he is today i am his daddy i feel let down will this pain ever end this unemployed manager doesnt think it ever will blackburn want me as their manager but as a burnley fan i cant bring myself to sign the contract 710 i feel like ive been cheated on
recommended
addictive as always
recommended
love this game especially when i mod the game with the ebola mod and my players get ebola in england so i cant use them for 4years 1010
recommended
great game better then fifa
recommended
game is great yeah you will get  often players will run like  but eventually you will realize it is realistic it gives you so much interface is amazing but ai sucks sometimes ball gets through the players not in my case when i shoot they block when they shoot it goes through me players with mertesacker pace run faster than bolt but still it provides amazing experience it is not really a game you would play all the time but when you are bored no hard feelings towards fm addicters it is overpriced it is not worth 50 but i bought it on sale for 33 and i am delighted
recommended
the best game ever
recommended
its my first fm and its pretty fun
recommended
much better interface than fm14ontop of this the new mocap they put in the game adds a nice layer to the game not present in 14 for veterans of the game series theres just as much tatical depth and choice making as before whereas for begininers there are handy tutoriuls as well as a bountiful amount of fan create gudies and such i would recommened this game to anybody with time on thier hands
recommended
so i used to get pirate versions of this game  i tried the 15 then i decided to buy it i love the game  the layout  the gameplay  this together with the fmrte and things are fantastic i will not be playing 14 for a while buy it
recommended
as someone who is not your typical gamer i never know what to expect from a game but i thought i would play this as it is a bit different from the rest of my collection i was not dissapointed at all it took me a little while to get used to all the screens but as i went along i found myself really getting behind my team and almost shouting at the screen during matches haha very good and a wicked time killer
recommended
this game takes over my life every time _
recommended
yes but not for full price like a lot of people i feel that paying every year 5060 bucks for only few changes is not ok i did not buy the game at full price
recommended
i have play fm since 2007 and totally fall in love with this game the last year sega release fm14 which is the worst in my opinion but they release fm15 and i think its better than the old one i love the new skin although the match engine not much better but overall i recomended this game
recommended
this game is addictiveif you love soccer and managing a teamcountry then you should definitely buy this game
recommended
i am a long term fan of this game franchise since the good old champ man 2 days however in recent years ive really struggled with releases  lots of broken features and a general feeling of new releases being more of an update than a new version i didnt have high hopes for this year im happy to report that ive been proven wrong the new ui is great with the google style search bar and easy to navigate to important information on the menu bar on the left the whole tracksuit  tactical manager profile option is a great feature and at lower league clubs youre able to directly involve yourself in the development of players without needing to hire in unobtainable coaches but it doesnt feel like a cheat as you need to surround yourself with motivators tacticians and probably a director of football im not sure on some of the new staff role  not really sure what a head physio does over and above a normal physio but the chief scout is great in removing the micromanagement of setting scouting assignments but it would be useful to be able to override his assignments if you need to match engine looks good but still seems to have some bugs  im sure my strikers arent offside half the time its called and often find muyself screaming never or 10 to the referee at my screen but thats no diferent from when im in the stands on a saturday  overall this is a good version of the game and has reinvigorated my love following a couple of years in the wilderness
recommended
meh a improvement is a improvement whether its big or small
recommended
officially 100 hours of this game now i havnt even played as much as i wanted to but 100 hours is still a remarkable achievement there are some people with more than a 1000 hours i know its crazy bust that just sums up how addictive this game is if you are new to fm it takes a while to get used to the game everything looks so complicated and time consuming fm is very time consuming but thats what makes it so good you can literally sit there for hours and not even realise its been 10 hours and you havnt eaten it took me a while to finish my first season with arsenal my supported club because i was still learning fm i was new to it this xmas not the series its self as i used to play the handheld version up to 2012 then i just stuck to fifa but after looking at it for pc i thought i would try it out like i said before though the first season is the longest you know your learning the game and its mechanics but after that you blast through it in 100 hours i managed to complete 6 seasons 100 hours seems like alot for 6 hours maybe it is but its a very rewarding game the game is semi realistic i would say more realistic than games like fifa but these are completely different games some transfers can be stupid and the agent fees you have to pay are obscene but this does not take the fun away however does make it frustrating when you realise rues has a release claus of 20 million but his agent fees are like 10 mil which does come out of your transfer budget by the way the tactic creator is spot on the ability to chnage player roles pick if they will attack support or defend and setup individual and team instructions to make sure your players are palying how you want them with fm i never fully got into training and he good thing is you can make your assistant take charge of all training and match preperation so you can focus on the more important aspects like transfers and winnig games if you wish the match engine is suprisingly better than it looks i really enjoy it it gives you the ability to watch the games in 2d if you prefer or dont have the computer to run 3d but thats no dissapointment the 2d gives the game some nostalgia of championship manager with the dots moving around the field back in the day good times i wish they would add some way to upgrade stadiums and i wish they would have the proper premier league licenses besides this the game is excellent i give it a solid 1010
recommended
apart from the occasional ridiculous injury crisis its a good game
recommended
love this game the only problem is when i spend hours upon hours at a time playing
recommended
very great game
recommended
football manager is football manager i guess
recommended
why there is no badges in russian leage  why than is player injured during the match  he still can play until the final whistle  the game is great  i can play hours 
recommended
once again sports interactive have hit the nail on the head
recommended
one of the most addictive games ever 
recommended
i hope the game include full game packs so we dont donlot to another sites
recommended
one of the best football managers to date this is because of the new skin and the better more in depth database
recommended
dont understand why i have to login in to steam servers to play a game i have bought and played numerous times already so frustrating to not be able to play my game because your servers cannot cope
recommended
sick game bar the inconsistency of the teams apart from that so realistic and quality
recommended
i actually love this game but i dont watch the match i just have the writing like old school football manager games go alot quicker when i do this
recommended
so far im enjoying this game after 50 hours of gameplay i took the team morecombe from league 2 all the way to the top league in england
recommended
3d match engine is a vast improvement some motion capture has been used and it makes the games much more fluid than before new interface is good and control of tactics during a match is expansive like it best fm yet
recommended
the game is still good despite all the negative comments by a lot of players out there they could still improve the graphics engine while the 3d match plays and the other thing that really annoys me is that no matter which team i manage i will always end up with a lot of injured players and mainly my 1st team players will be out for mths
recommended
like this game  am playing fm for 15 years an this one is the most wonderfoul one
recommended
its football manager what more do i need to say i have put around 70 hours into this game trying to win the epl with my liverpool fc team i did it 810
recommended
i like football manager 2015 but there seems to be no faces on some playerswhen are we going to get an update to resolve this issue could not with facepacks
recommended
guided halifax to the champions league move over hodgson
recommended
greatest game ever the amount of time ive played this game over the years is rediculous
recommended
love it cm & fmveteranenthusiast since 199394
recommended
more difficult and challenging than previous fms and takes a little getting used to but all together another cracking game
recommended
too addictive
recommended
maybe if steam didnt have constant massive updates i would actually enjoy this game unfortunately this has not been the case this game is probably brilliant but as of yet ive had no chance to play it thanks steam
recommended
how do i stop playing 
recommended
the best game in the series
recommended
top notch game been playing fm since 11 like it tah
recommended
well it was better before latest update but still best fm
recommended
been playing these games since the original premier manager now with fm2015 it was hard to get used to due to the different interface but its still a good game plenty of stuff to do challenges working up from the lower leagues
recommended
best simulation fm ever for now
recommended
hard as balls
recommended
a very fun game that you can get stuck with for hours
recommended
its good enough for me
recommended
i am addicted to this game
recommended
its excellent its much more in depth than any of the fifa games or any of the other football simulators this is one of the best simulation games that ive ever played if you love football soccer you should purchase this game
recommended
i really wish clubs in in the epl got logos and players faces overalli enjoyed it big time well done
recommended
why cant play
recommended
not sure why so many people are downvoting it having spent an extensive amount of time playing fm15 i can safely say there are bugs but none of them gamebreaking i havent noticed having more injuries than id expect if you know what fm15 is about and have played old versions then its certainly worth a purchase the level of detail and tinkering thats available to you is fantastic if you want to take over chelsea and win the cl or take over a lower league club and take them to the next level its all available for you here im a football coach irl and this is the most realistic football game youll ever find until fm16 anyway id give it a 9510 if youre only going to play this for less than an hour or know nothing about soccer or think this is a fifa clone then id go find another game
recommended
won the league with liverpool most unrealistic version yet
recommended
amazing game absolutly love it
recommended
thas was is good
recommended
great game
recommended
there could have been more improvements from fm14 but still the best football management simulator on the market cant see that changing any time soon looking forward to seeing what 16 brings
recommended
well just about finished the free weekend and i have to write about fm15 that i still cannot make up my mind on purchasing it the game is a deep mineshaft of detail that can get you hooked if you like that level of detail but if you want to build gainsborough trinity from the depths to the premiership within the game you are going to have no life outside of playing this game the graphics are okay but not special on matchday players do still wonder around a lot the detail and depth are nice but you need time to learn the processes and where things are i suppose the same can be said for most games but this has been taken to a fine art or torture level in this game the last one of these games i purchased was fm10 and i refused to purchase another one until i could see some improvement in the match engine here i feel let down by fm15 players running backwards was always a bugbear of mine bug being the right word for me the depth would take time to learn and it may be worth paying the tenner now but having bought train fever i havent the time at the moment for this game the question is will it come on sale again probably not until fm16 comes out if you have the patience time and want to be a football manager then this could be right for you for me i am undecided ps for the people who call this soccer not football all can say is where are all the american football management games because i would love to make the redskins the world champions dont laugh too loud
recommended
very good game for pepole who love football its pretty complicated at the start but you understand it easy fast 
recommended
yes football manager is a great game and i am sure that all those who dont suffer from dyslexia find the endless pages of texts enjoyable  but i reckon within a season i could have read the equilavent of war and peace or a la recherche du temps perdu within a few seasons i just dont have the patience any more beyond this there are certain problems with the tactics how long ball and crosses beats any attacking or even the passing game its just frustrating to spend all my time finding great players and all it matters is to hoof it long into space and then cross it in on the review its football manager for christs sake  so i just could not not recommend it
recommended
based on 40 hours of gameplay i usually try to write about a game after 25 hours but with this being my 1st ever experience with fm it took a bit longer to get used to or even understand what the heck i was doing with that said i must say i find this game to be very enjoyable im no soccer fan to the point i can tell you anything about any player team league or competition i just watch it especially the world cup & bpl with that said ive learned a ton about soccer simply from playing this game and make no mistake there is a ton of stuff in here the depth you can take yourself is beyond explanation i have a challenge currently taking place on my work pc and a career in effect on my home pc you will be busy making decisions moreso than actually playing a match and theres the fun of it its the wheeling and dealing that gets me more than anything i always start from the bottom in any game i play so i spend a lot of time working my way up from the lowest leagues to the premieres in fm15 you have to manage your squads staff finances and the media among other things and if you like micromanaging you will definitely enjoy fm15 your board players and staff can be real pains in the  sometimes but it makes the game that much more realistic and challenging since my playing time i havent come across any bugs the game runs pretty smooth and the speed of the 14nation games i set up is pretty fast no crashes to report the 3d engine is pretty much rubbish though i mean it isnt bad but lords of football runs rings around fm15 in that department and to be completely honest with you sis released version is pretty damn ugly it looks too much like a spreadsheet i hate it youll hate it the over 2 million players playing it hate it therefore you need the essentials at the time of this writing i recommend you installing these mods to make this game shine 1 fm 2015 flut dark skin v18 or later [makes the game gorgeous] 2 dazs8 mini stadium packs [adds team stadiums to the club homepage] 3 dnk 20145 backgrounds megapack [adds beautiful wallpaper to different aspects of the game] 4 fm15 real names fix files from sortitoutsinet v11 or later [selfexplanatory and very useful] 5 megapack tcm15 [adds truetolife logos for just about every aspect of the game] 6 sortioutsi cutout megapack v73 or later [adds truetolife player faces in the game] these mods work together to bring you a more effective and visually appealing layout to the game the flut skin also makes it a lot easier to read the information given and brings more information to the forefront while reducing your need to hunt for resourceful information whatever that may be verdict without mods 6510 fun experience with nagging interface issues verdict with mods 910 an exceptional sportssim gaming experience
recommended
won the league with liverpool therefor the game is missing several tags such as fantasy comedy gore postapocalyptic and horror unrealistic game even flopotelli is in the top 5 goal scorers
recommended
i cant stop playing send help
recommended
this game is addicting its so good chelsea all the way i won 4 trophies the league fa cup campions league community shield what a season d
recommended
best fm so far it will ruin lives and you will never see your friends again
recommended
great
recommended
fun except actual gameplay is tedious and luckbased i reccomend playing on classic so you do more of the fun stuff and less of the press conferences interface is great 7510
recommended
most of the people saying it sucks have over 300 hours played its a good game
recommended
brilliant game
recommended
great game i have played over 200 hrs and i think i have fallen in love i guess you can say that it is a very good game
recommended
welbeck can actually finish in the game
recommended
game isnt bad at all however i have noticed that the assistant manager isnt always good with match training if youre players are completely unfamilliar with the tactics in place the assistant manager will continue to coach att movement etc other than that quite enjoyable 810
recommended
legendary classic must buy you can take liverpool to a few premier league titles  oh wait thats not possible
recommended
not a bad game but i expected more to be honest a very small step ahead from the 2013 game and even smaller from the 2015 game
recommended

football manager 2015 is one of those games that i dont feel qualified to review since its online community seems to generally be so much more knowledgeable about it than me but i also feel that having played it for over 1000 hours i should at least share my thoughts and recommend it for those who havent yet taken the plunge ive played fm2015 since the beta having preordered it and the only fm id played before then was the fm2014 demo and even then it was only briefly the 1000 hours of playing time may be misleading though ive read that fm is the sort of game that sucks you in for hours and hours like all other games designed around regularly fulfilling various tasks and then clickingjust one more timeto advance a turn but one of the main draws for me is that i can play fm while multitasking on everyday work i just keep it running almost all day and whenever i have a break i click open the window do what i need to do advance a turn and go back to my work as that turn simulates sure there are times when i find myself returning to the game much more often than allows for productive workone way im able to realize this is when i keep returning to the game only to find it still simulating the last turn id clicked to advancebut at this point in my life when i have a lot of projects to do throughout the day i really appreciate a game that im not forced to sit down and focus on 100% each session one major reason why im able to play fm so casually i think is because i primarily play football manager classic i started out playing fmc since the beta figuring i should start out with that mode based off what id read and what the game told me that original save ended up lasting me 5 months spanning 20 ingame seasons after i felt id accomplished enough in that save i tried out a few different saves in both fmc and the full game but the only ones that stuck were in fmc for one i tend to instant result all my matches which i know is possible in the full game if you use a skin that unlocks that button but i dont want to go through that trouble i guess ive tried playing out all the matches in a full game save before and as exciting and immersive as that can be not to mention how much more personal your players seem to you that way it just takes way too much time an affordance i dont have for one video game in an ocean of so many others i also much prefer fmcs streamlined scouting system as id rather just assign my scout to various countries or competitions than micromanaging everything that scout should look for and when im not so opposed to the rest of the full games micromanagement as i think it allows you to sufficiently delegate the rest of your responsibilities if you prefer i play fm to assemble a team of my own and create and use tactics to guide that team to victory i dont feel the need to manage much beyond that that said there are two features in the full game that i wish could carry over to fmcmaybe in fm2016 first and this may seem minor i wish i could suggestchoose from a recommended shortlist of affiliated clubs in fmc like i can do in the full game especially as players experience more of the world of soccer and the many clubs that inhabit it i think its natural for them to have opinions on those clubs including which ones theyd like their own club to have an affiliation with i also think that making available this sort of choice would add to players roleplaying experience building upon the vision they have for the club they mostly have control over second i would love an fmc database editor im pleased that i can mod the uniforms and logos in fmc through universal xml files and images but i want to mod clubs and competitions as welland play others mods the only reason i even tried a few full game saves is to be able to play mods i was pretty bummed when i realized id have to sacrifice much of what makes fm so appealing to me ie fmc in order to play these mods that seemed so intriguing i know there are plenty of reviews out there for fm2015 that touch on all its new features along with summing up the game in general for potential new players so i decided my own review would be different by focusing exclusively on my own experiences with fm2015 i hope some of the things i mentioned resonated with you maybe even enough for you want to join one of the most enduring game communities online too

as someone who has put in over 600 hours into this game i definately recommend it i took concord rangers to the premier league title really rewarding

under no circumstances buy this game i thought becoming a football manager will cure my life long thirst for football and take few hours out of my life i was wrong and i used to be like you i had friends  life and a job this game took everything away from me this game will make you see attributes like determination leadership and agression on real life people they will start to pop up from 1 to 20 on floating texts around their head once you start seeing them you cannot unsee them anymore hidden attributes off real life people are trickier tho you need to stalk them for a longer periods time valuable months and productivity of my life disaapreared just because i have to play  just  one  more game if you value your life even a bit stay away from game
recommended
pretty addictive game steep learning curve at first but keep improving your team every season start with a lower league team thats where this game shines
recommended
the most comprehensive football management sim on the market been a fan since the old championship manager days and stiill keep an eye out for the new version every year i try and limit my time on it otherwise i just become addicted
recommended
another great football manager game they just keep getting better & better each year been a fan of the football manager series since football manager came out the challenge of this game is amazing the buying selling of players finances of the club profit or loss transfer & wage budget scouting for players for first team or for future is remarkable interviews for the job morale of the team buying & selling of staff many more features to this game is just wow 1010 recommend this game who wants a challenge to become a football manager

extremely fun game for anyone really into the world of soccer doing the job you wish your real life club chairman could do is always satisfying
recommended

recommended
great game but the price it s not the right one for that season 
recommended
reading the reviews i thought this would be a bad game i played it on free trail i was awesome i have played the previous fms this one has few flaws like many injuries but i was totally hooked for 14 hours non stop i was sad when the trail got over i was totally devastated i would totally recommend you to get this game its a must buy game if your a football lover who loves strategies your going to just love it made me feel like a true manager unlike its previous games which were average to me this one was really realistic only injury flaws were unrealistic otherwise this game would be a 1010 with the new fix of ver 155 i would rate this game a 910 because it got me really hooked

tldr buy it if you want to manage a football team and either love the series or havent played in a few seasons it isnt perfect but youll get mileage from it i would recommend this annual update if you havent bought the last 1 or 2 football managers if you have bought them all like me then you probably dont need a review i wouldnt say that it is flawless though players seem to pick up injuries and knocks that put the out of the current game a little too often when compared to my watching of football out in the wilds of real life maybe thats because i start with low league teams however and may improve with the skill of my staff in later game play i also find it frustrating that you can employ staff to delegate tasks to but then find that the most simple tasks evade them for example i had a director of football who continued to sign players even though we were already over our clubs wage limit i can avoid this by either not recommending players or by leaving the contract signing to me but it feels like a waste of time to delegate only part of what a staff members role should be to that staff member again this might be because i start at low league english conference south but it seems a bit awkward that they cant even do basic sums the rest of the game is tight and i enjoy the micromanagement of the team right down to the training i also find some information into the development of the players easier to navigate to than before i could probably write a lot more but i find online reviews easier when they are terse and to the point
recommended
buy this game for someone you never want to see in your life again 
recommended
180 hours with a full time job a girlfriend and a social life it finds a way to squeeze you of every free moment you have its a must have for any big fan of football

if you like soccer and if youd like to manage a professional team probably this game is all you want  however graphics are terrible the soccer games seem to run in dos microsoft os before windows 95  ouch  you cannot recognise your players on the field  710 >> because of the bad graphics simply not acceptable in 2015

fm 2015 lives up to its marketing of being the most indepth football management simulation available but its not without its quirks and issues football manager 2015 offers a lot of detail the sheer number of stats positions tactics players teams leagues stadiums etc etc is daunting the steep learning curve and poor explanations ingame of the mechanics and options despite the numerous tooltips make the first season or so difficult for a newcomer to the series once you have a handle on some of it it becomes quite enjoyable to plan out a season and execute to your plan i had more than one moment during a match when i was as excited to see my players score a goal as i am when im coaching a real life game finding a good prospect or molding a young player into a star is also rewarding as is finishing a season at the top of the league or being named coach of an allstar team on the other side of things the game has some quirky behavior and although it appears that many of the bugs with injuries and match ai have been fixed since release there are still some headscratchers more than once ive had a player complain about not playing enough firstteam soccer before the first game of the season and this for players that joined in the first transfer window of the season the dialogue system is an odd mix of mood and phrases that dont mesh and the reaction to them is often hard to calculate my assistant coach suggested that i drop a player who had just been named player of the year because there is another player on the team with better stats that can play the same position my youth coach wouldnt agree to a salary that was below the maximum set by the board when i made the offer but did when the ai general manager handled the transaction that same coach then retired as soon as the next year started one of my players threatened to leave the team unless i promised that wed win the league that year but then didnt believe we could even though we had just been declared the top of the league the day before theres also a bit of an issue inherent in the way the ingame players view their own progress as i took them from young inexperienced players into league winning stars they wanted to move to bigger and better clubs and payrolls if allowed to pursue their dreams the rest of the team gets angry for letting them leave but if you make them stay the player gets angry and starts underperforming  morale plays such a big role that this makes you lose and cause everyone else to be unhappy which leads to more losing and on and on its very circular overall the game should please strategy and simulation fans that have any interest in soccerfootball or fantasy sports  especially those with a fondness for spreadsheets and budgeting and a tolerance for repetitive and nonsensical press conferences
recommended
rep great banter
recommended
highly addictive especially if youre already familiar with the series would recommend
recommended
only bad thing is that there are so many ing injuries otherwise its addicting and fun
recommended
leading your favourite team to victories is a wonderful experience the gameplay can be very simple merely strategising and handling the media but it can get complex and very taxing on time if one were to handle every single aspect of running a club alternatively you can just delegate everything away and go on a prolonged holiday and pray for victory this is a good title to purchase although it is unfortunate that fifa did not sell its rights to this game maker as a result you will not see authentic pictures of the players as well as logos of clubs nonetheless this game is good and well worth buying

8 out 10 for me love the franchise love the game and love the new ui the only thing i dont give 1010 is because of the crazy looking goals i getgive in the game still my favourite football managing game and would recommend in a heartbeat
recommended
a very nice and detailed football manager game i have enjoyed this game a lot but in future though please sort out the stupid errors defenders and keepers this is so frustrating to watch so much that i have to just put match highlights on commentry only and i would also say to make the game more realistic it looks very unrealstic when the players passshoot etc apart form that though its a solid game and i do like playing this game its easy to pass time with it gets a 810 from me
recommended
its a very fun game already got more then 1000 hours on record ofcourse the game is running while im watching tv just proceeding to next match comparing this game to earlier fm versions the side bar is very handy
recommended
really fun game to play to pass time also if you enjoy football and are tactical then buy this game
recommended
truly terrible match engine fantastic in pretty much every other aspect save yourself some frustration and just look at the stats during matches like the good old champ man days that way you wont have to wonder why your goalkeeper has nailed his feet to the floor or why your centre backs slip into comas from time to time
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played quite brilliant really a few more features id like to see though likie better graphics when watching the 3d games and included player faces club badges kits
recommended
if carlsberg made football management games this would be it awesome almost and i say almost better than fm07
recommended
this is the first football manager game i have put any time into i tried a few but gave up after about an hour i love my football and this time round i actually took the time to read a few websites on starting about and what tactics would work for my team this made the game for me alot more enjoyable since the difficulty curve was a little more forgiving i have read alot of negative reviews on the game especially the 3d match engine but i feel that the match engine adds to the game and i love watching the matches on extended highlights even if sometimes your defenders will do stupid things  overall if you love your football and are willing to put a few hours into learning the mechanics and a few google searches on how your team plays you will have alot of fun

besides traditional sports games and online shooters this is probably the most time ive spent on a game let alone a sim where you dont even control the players directly simply put i love this game as i said ive always been a fan of sports games mainly nhl and fifa and while i loved the online competition i also really liked to manage my team tradebuy players arrange your lineup and strategy ect heck i could spend hours just trading players or trying to anyways resigning them scouting out potential new additions and whatnot thru all this believe it or not id never heard of fm in my defense id been playing exclusively on consoles for the last 67 years so when i found football manager a game that is precisely about the management aspect of the team i jumped on the bandwagon and boy am i glad i did i love how much control it gives you over a team i mean contracts training transfers tactics name it its there and in great detail contracts have a bunch of clauses this canadian had never hear of tranfers are not as easy and simple as youd think sometimes and tactics can be tweakedadjusted to your hearts content there arent many things more satisfying than taking a lower league team and with careful management and ambitious transfers turning them into a top flight powerhouse who challenges for the league and champions cup year after year one of the downsides tho is that when you do manage to raise a lower league club to glory it seems the chaiman andor board dont ajdust their mentalities quite accordingly therefore ive won the bpl twice in a row with fulham now coupled with a champions league trophy and various cupsshields etc and im still making around 4550k a year and the board doesnt want to expand our new stadium 3 yrs old of 365k capacity even though attendance is through the roof and the club are raking in decent profits and are atop the club value table another le is the sim engine who will sometimes decide to decimate your team with injuries which isnt as bad as early on thanks to updates but i did have to use up all my subs in the first half once because three players went down i mean seriously and they were all in the 90% fitness range too boot it will also make your players miss an absurd amount of scoring chances with the very occasional highlight reel strike from 30 yards strike and exremely rare bicycle kick going in other than that nothing significant really brings down this gem of a game couple it with a decent facelogo pack to make it look more realistic and the fm editor and a custom skin amidst the vast array of choices for a truly customized experience and youll be all set for countless hours of fun

bought the game today because there was supposed to be a patch to fix the terrible defence and injury problems i just started my first ever save and i already have 16 players injured every time i hit continue i was just waiting to see how long the next injury would be also if you thought this game had any semblance of defensive players actually doing anything other than scoring own goals or watching players walk right passed them you are in the wrong place i realize this is the beta but the release is in 4 days and i dont see them fixing that many problems with a comlpetely broken game ill play it again on release and the next patch but im back to fm 2014 not much better until then will update review upon full release andor next patch edit next game after writing this review i had 3 players injured during the game this takes my total to 19 injuries before the season even begins my reserve squad is nothing but loans and more injured players as well maybe thats just bad luck but seriously how can this many people be injured long term all at once update upon playing the full release i can officialy say that the defense is still terrible and starting a new save fresh for the release has resulted in 9 injuries before the end of the preseason with crewe alexandre so i am no longer playing the beta and as i guessed the problems have still not been sorted out guess ill just be waiting until they patch more to start again if im going to lose my life to my football manager addiction it wont be to a severely bugged match engine

i havent slept in days i got fired from work lost my wife and kids and my house is getting repossessed tomorrow i did however manage to finish 4th with spurs in my first season only to be knocked out of the last round of cl qualifying 1010 edit on a serious note fix three things please 1 too many injuries ronaldo got injured three times during my first season at real he only played about 8 times during the season 2 too many goals my first team is leaking goals at home against rayo who are 19th this happens on a seemingly random basis 3 players getting unhappy because theyre not getting played just starting my 2nd season and varane is unhappy that hes not getting played enough its preseason you 
recommended
game is different than other incarnations in the fact that the ball in the engine is quite bouncy until it hits the turf you cant play one formationtactic as the game goes on in the full mode or you probably will lose as the ai makes adjustments im currently in the middle of a hyde coaching run really enjoying the low level start and the ability to go to caoching courses overall if you want a full indepth rpg of a management game with the newest players this is worth it if you want a game that is already modded polished and fully tweaked fm14 might be a better value i bought it ill play somewhere near 600 hours again this year so i cant help but recommend it if you enjoy strategymanagementman management games no other game has had me fist pump as hard as when the regen scouted cb gustavo ellacopolous scored the winner for tottenham in the champions league final the game is as good as the effort you put in especially at a lower league team

so far its pretty great usually managing large teams like barcelona which i am can get boring fast but this time star players are harder to manage and now have a mind of their own this make things challenging the stats of most players i know are satisfactory you also have better control of your team when you make a touch line shout it actually affects how your players play the game the only thing i found annoying was that the transfer embargo of barcelona was put a day earlier than it was supposed and i couldnt get gundogan becaus of this

its asolid improvement on last years edition imo just finished my first season with braintree town in the vanarama conference finished in 1st 2 points between me and gateshead in 2nd quick tip for those of you that play similar leagues loan banton from luton town young striker who i got in octnov i played him as a lone poacher in a direct system in his first 22 games he got 21 goals finished with 38 gp 31 gls

probably the best fm in years looks better allows backgrounds and seems to run smoothly
recommended
what can i say fellow fmers no question the game is more aesthetically pleasing to the eye and it runs a tad quicker than previous years im going to keep this short and sweet pros updated database nice to look at job interviews are a nice touch cons its the beta and will be updated but there are issues gks are horrendous free kicks go in about 90% of the time selling players is more difficult over all its only small things that are ling at me this year but im very impressed with this years instalment of football manager httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrllvuyskdr8 if you want to watch me lose over and over again then please do come watch my lets play videos with southampton sound quality is lacking but ive sorted that after the 7th episode cheers and thanks for reading

its back to watching match of the day and it seeming like its set in a paralell universe what are you on about lineker im pretty sure that mourinho is manchester uniteds manager and that wilfried bony is their star striker you tooloh hang on the game is as good as ever
recommended
if you have played the others your soon know how addictive these games become in terms of is it better than 2014 well at first its not simply because of getting used to the new layout but once you master this then yes all the way better player interaction and match engine and simply more behind the scenes as well to tweak the staff on this game have been improved and how you utilise them while still providing a challenging experience 1010
recommended
great game last fm i had was 2011 massive jump match engine is amazing love the new setup been playing online with a friend with no problems i havent come across any bugs yet apart from an own goal from halfway line happens right i am sure with patches along the way this game will improve along the way not much difference between the beta version to full everyone complaining same game no different to fifa every year i really like this version huge improvements
recommended
generally the game has much the same feel to it as recent versions sure theyve moved the menu system but its still all a bit messy to look at the match engine is funny the number of players you see just falling over or deciding to slowly walk to a lose ball while the opposing players sprint is a joke not to mention its still bugged with so many long range shots from outside the area you can train all your players to restrict long shots and set individual instructions to not take long shots and set the team instruction to work the ball into the box and still they all do long shots rather than trying to take defenders on as ive instructed all in all its still a good game just like the last version nothing special has changed and id recommend most people stick to the previous version and just update their data
recommended
i only played a little seems fun though
recommended
great fm game has some issues which get sorted out soon anyway but its fun as hell
recommended
game is greatinjuries bit over the toplovin game enginemassive step up
recommended
the beta version for this game isnt impressive too many basic and fudemental errors eg cant right click players into positions have to drag them and it takes ages and you cant do set piece instructions as the button does completely nothing  but the game play is far better this year with similar graphics to fifa
recommended
i dont know why so many people have been complaining it feels the same as last years game but with slightly better graphics and a more organized nicer menuinterface if you enjoy football pick it up in the sale
recommended
absolutely awesome the new features are fantastic gets me continue playing and playing addictive again well done si if possible they should add voice commentary in and that will be definitely awesome

almost 30 hours into beta 1502 the game is perfectly playable right now but there are some issues with defending which im sure will be patched before launch this friday if in doubt then wait till the full release and reviews of the patched version before paying up
recommended
liking it changes to the game are subtle and things i cant be bothered with like press and training are far too repetitive but in saying that it has it good points the over feel of the game is good with the new ui they have made a lot of improvments a word to the developers think big rather than loads of small improvments you guys need to go for a big leap try and give us regular customers something to get excited about stadium design or being able to create a club from scratch in the lower leagues of a country and make it a real force over 10 seasons but all in all if your a fan of the series then youll be happy with this
recommended
regarding a lot of these negeative reviews i honestly do not know what game people have been playing the new side bar is a massive improvement to fms accessability each core page is now much easier to access freeing up space for a large search bar to instantly find any player cup or competition in the games database the new report page is excellent it is now as clear as it can be what the pros and cons of each player are making it even easier to scout the perfect player for your team in a given situation as for the match engine it keeps getting better and better each year and fm 2015 marks a big step forward with motion capture animations added to the mix how anyone can play in 2d when the engine quality has improved so dramatically since its implementation is beyond me fm 2015 is the biggest leap forward in the series for the past 23 years
recommended
so far i loved the game really good and fair enough to play it this year graphics really good teams nice players awesome and perfect training system in my opinion just the best fm till now awesome guys really deserved the 50 my review is 910
recommended
this game is very good its much better than the previous years it seems a lot more technical and your decisions as a manager have more effect on your team and the game in general i love the idea of being able to edit your manager stats attacking defence ect its really good and its nice to be able to view them and use them in training if anyone needs a question answered id be happy to help  overall ill give the game 910  reason being is that its only the beta version but i cant see there being much changed for the full version in a few days time 7th november thank you for yet another great game
recommended
only complaint for fm15 is ridiculous prices for players tried to buy shaquri from bayer and they wanted 67 million no way is he worth that 1520 max then tried to buy kovacic from inter and they wanted 51 and lucas leiva this is ruining the game with stupid prices hope they can sort this out
recommended
love this game not much difference from last year and my cons are that im liverpool beat bayern munich 41 had like 20 shots  beat chelsea 21 had 15 shots played crystal palce my striker missed two sitters this stiker has finshing of like 19 losted 31 there striker score hatrick with finshing of like 13 makes sence i had 25 shots they had 5  4 on target
recommended
i have loved this game series for years and preordered the new one and even though i would reccomend it it is slightly bizarre loads of goals loads of injuries loads of yellowred cards and sometimes you go on losing streaks that are unrealistic and absolutely impossible to get out of i finally managed to get ahead in a game and one of my players was sent off so i lost it sort of seems like they want to make it as difficult as possible they just need to tone it all down a little bit and it should be fine i mean one player i was against scored 4 in the first half i mean liverpol are bad the moment but i think it is slightly unrealistic for abel hernandez to get 4 against me in the capital one cup in less tha 45 minutes never mind i can focus on the league oh wait it is impossible to win in it im sure it will improve once the beta period is over
recommended
based on beta  played all games since day 1 and most have had there issues but then its very hard to wipe out all problems with such a variation of methods nothing i would class as gaming breaking occured and any issues with 3d engine can generally be ignored or altered tactics wise to suit easily the best and most comprehensive version thus far much improvement to gui scouting etc and requires more patience when lower league think all the changes are for the better and enjoying new challenge of working out all the new nuances and mechanics
recommended
i will recommend that you buy this game dont listen to all this negative recommendations
recommended
this game is very fun to play it still has a few bugs but hell its still in beta full game release is 7th of november be sure to get it if you havent already because this game is sick
recommended
same annoying quirks as last year  injuries implausible goals meaningless ratings etc but with a slightly different skin not worth the money at full price if you see a decent sale and you feel like throwing away a few shekels then feel free to pay for this crap  i got this for game free and i still feel cheated
not recommended
the game is just awesome really good job from sport interactive i suggest it 100% careful with crash i had crash but sega helped me  buy this  <3
recommended
the beautiful game just ot a make over after playing the series for a number of years now i was expecting the same thing yet it seems so much improved on things i didnt even know needed improving 1 example is the competitions menu it shows where you are in the league and cups the staff are more helpful and i like the introduction to tunnel interviews the 3d graphics now involve motion capture in them and look much improved 1 thing that is really noticeable is tweaking a system example my false 9 striker was not getting any goals but i was winning games i change him to poacher and he gets bucket loads if you love football and you love the idea of managing your fave team get this its a no brainer
recommended
epl logo different in need of 3rd party app bad choice i will not buy anymore football manager if they not inprove
not recommended
so far so good lots of new features to play with couple of downsides so far though new layout seems more cluttered than before stock skin is horrible on the eyes hoping someone makes a nice clean skin like fm2014 was easy on the eyes playing as a club with red as a primary colour if very difficlut to do as are some of the other colours not so bad with white
recommended
well in my opinion this is by far the best football manager to date the graphics on the 3d match are really good the gameplay seems alot smoother goalkeepers actually make really good saves ive seen alot of people moaning about the beta version what you all need to understand is the whole point of this is so any problems that do occor you let them no they fix it and to be fair there are a few faults 1 theres way to many injuries within pre season 2 theres been to many times when the ball is in the box and the strikers or defence dont really do anything about it too many realistic goalscoring chances missed 3 ridiculous transfer fees i no in fm14 it was the same but it seems unless you have 40 million to spend on one half decent player then you aint getting a half decent player theres a few more things but i reckon the developers will fix all this before the game is actually released so im not worried its well worth the money and if your a die hard football manager player then once this little things are fixed youll love it
recommended
i love the series but this one is a mess so far there are some good new features in the game like the new scouting system  makes the game experience even more realistic i played with carlisle utd  a low profile team in england second devision which relegated from 1st devision last season the initial goal was promotion  the board set a budget of 0 transfer funds and 45k wages for additional players i believe this goal is almost impossible to achieve even for the most hardcore players i loaned 8 players for free from teams in the premier league and signed few free agents but even with them my team couldnt match most teams in 2nd dev i am still recommanding the game because i believe si will fix all issues
recommended
good game  honestly i still prefer the layoutinterface from 2014 but i probs just need to get used to it crashed on me twice over 3 hours mac which is extremely annoying as i have to replay games won 3 the first time it crashed played the games again and drew 2 lost 1 as a result my macbook nearly went out the window get it sorted also faaaaaar too many injuries  most of them being 3weeks 4 games into the season and half my team were injured although this is only the beta there are loads of changes that have to be made and hopefully they are fixed when the full game is released if it stays the same way chances are i wont have a laptop to play it on for very long
recommended
although the most challenging of the series so far more because of the new adaption to the layout and the scouting methods for me its a big improvement on user interface but the harsh amount of injuries it makes progression a longer task where you have to put mild detail into the smaller things instead of throwing it to your below par am i suggest it if you put a good amount of time into the later games but for a newbie 1314 would be a safer choice in the way of enjoyment of the game and winning things
recommended
its good
recommended
just as good as every other there is no better game out there
recommended
injuries are broken other than that its good 
recommended
pros new ui while it may take some getting used to its superior to the old one scourting much better and more realistic than the old system also great new scouting reports stadium view with banners chatting with players board journalists etc improved new tactics creator much better both vissually and technically cons need some patching goalkeepers seems to be completely useless even the top ones plus their reactions in 3d game engines reminds me of kidengarden kids tring to goalkeep they make me wanna go to 2d games again the new generic logos for the non lincenced leagues are bad guess well have to wait for workshop to fix edit after all the patching the game is much better the goalkeeper works much much better
recommended
my first football manager game i love fifa series and decided to try fm15 wasnt disappointed great game
recommended
this game is a pure simulation for all football fans i recommend it
recommended
i feel fm 15 to be exceptional i believe the match engine to be very modern and that the new user interface is revolutionaryi played the beta which i found brilliantbut there were some probs but im glad to say they have been fixed for the full game i was falling away from fm for a bit dispite play each of the last 5 but fm15 has brought me right back to why i fell in love with football manager
recommended
very much similar to previous iterationsbut thats exactly what we are looking for
recommended
i feel this is the best football manager out of all the old ones it is much more fun with plenty of things to do to improve your team and many difficult decisions you have to make to become successful therefore i recommend all of you to buy it if you are interested in football but the negative side of this game is that it does not have enough online players willing to play online it is more fun if you play it with friends on a side note if you want to join me in football manager you can add me im almost always on steam
recommended
addictive

football manager                                                    thanks fm

i bought this game expecting to be hired by a real football club however im still waiting this is slower than amazon
recommended
look no game can be perfect yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine but for a simulator such as this fm is frankly amazing overall i have to say that football manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all football fanatics if you are a past fm player and have been dissapointed with past versions i honestly beg you to revisit your perspective and try out fm15 please it is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money 910
recommended
nice game nice interface pretty accurate database i always thought that it was a scissors paper rock game and i should just fine the thing to win all games but its not the thing you do on the bench really affects the players on the field the 3d is indeed pretty bad but for me it doesnt matter because i use 2d if i wanted a graphical football game i would have chosen fifa instead the initial version was full of bugs but now with the latest updates it feels good
recommended
calling football manager the best management sim out there is always a redundant statement true as it is its peerless excellence has chased any significant rivals away but the biggest task is tempting players away from their carefully built career in the previous game sports interactive know that its games biggest competition remains itself and as you may tell your team at halftime they must guard against complacency fm15s changes tend to contribute to gentle improvement rather than startling disruption but should do enough to tempt you into starting that managerial journey all over again
recommended
infinitely better than fifa also i have no life any longer
recommended
it is a great game to play and the menus look better it is worth the money

fun and worth
recommended
the title of the game is misleading it should be called football watcher 2015 every match seems to play out a certain way for the full 90 regardless of what you or the opponent do im not saying its scripted but tactical changes dont alter the match at all also about realism certain tactics automatically work with any team even though they make no sense at all or always fail even though they have been proven to work well in real life just look at the tactics uploaded to the steam workshop there are things like 253 or 343 which would fail horribly in real football but work in this game because they exploit the weaknesses of the programming its not all negatives though outside of matches the game is excellent the level of detail in transfers contracts training player interaction etc is amazing if i could i would recommend the menus but not the match simulation itself
not recommended
still the best football simulator game after i missed the 2014 series this 2015 series is a much improvement from 2013 series the most improved part is 1 higher complexity in handling players contracts and negotiation with other clubs as well as 2 the improved tactical variety players role etc while this could be a little bit cumbersome for those who new to this series i believe the builtin tutorial will be very useful
recommended
great game veteran player of football manager series and i feel this game lives up to the football manager reputation i got it at christmas time so missed reported bugs that now mainly seem to be fixed as ever match engine can be tweaked to make it better but overall football manager 2015 will provide many hours of fun
recommended
another wonderful addition to the football manager franchise im an avid fan of the game and truely love this version dont be put off by all the negative comments if you enjoyed playing any of the previous versions buy this one and just quite simpily expect more details brilliant purcahase hours of funswearing at your players may i also reccomend the dvd released along side this game it was a fantastic insight i wont spoil it for you though

ive bought this game two days ago and before that ive read lots of reviews there was one review that came to me after two days of playing it could have been an update not a new game and it really should except for design an few minor new features everything is excatly the same as it was in fm2014 i will always reccomend this game it is still the best simulation of this kind but if they sell it as a new game they should make more then a few minor changes for me fm2015 is very expensive update
recommended
first season caused lot of injuries but after 1st season injuries gone its balanced and enjoable
recommended
very addicting game love every minute of it if you love football you will love this game although this years version takes some getting used to i definitely rate it higher than fm14
recommended
1010 this game has ruined more of my hours than anything else have been playing football manager games even before steam  absolutely sucks you in the best part is when the players you scouted and picked up in game for cheap become super stars in real life 
recommended
for all the people on here complaining about goal bugs etc they have almost all been fixed this is clearly the best football manager yet much more in depth and yes there are a few flaws but if youd care to name me one decent videogame without a few flaws id be much abliged to hear if you are a fan of football management sims get this game its as simple as that 
recommended
good game like all year 
recommended
i have played this for a whole now last time i played fm was fm12 i really like the fact they have two different game modes  if you want to cheat you dont have to add a third party application in this time with viruses etc its a great thing to have a thing available that the public wants it should be free and not a payed add on if you like fm i can warmly recommend this game it tuns smoothly i think its easier to play than earlier verions the ingame graphics are much better even on the laptop im playing with
recommended
very good game best of the fm games shame about the premier league not having the licensed badges but this can be added using steam workshopgame is more fun when playing online together rather than single player my opinion would definitely recommend
recommended
too realistic played as liverpool steven gerrard slipped so much ok now really im been a fan for football manager but not a big one i normaly pick it up soon after it was released i like always start with a team at the lowest divison and build up to get to the top when i did that i did another mode and choose a random team it was west ham united so far ive played both alot and experience only one problem that it quite a lot of injuries it was normal and still is im not really an expert on this but i dont care about it i found it very fun and play it more than often now
recommended
the best football manager yet just expect regular injury crises
recommended
bugged game won premier league with arsenal 1010
recommended
this is a true greate game
recommended
football manager 2015 is a great game for anyone who loves football soccer and this simulation game has been great
recommended
it has beautiful match engiene some glitches but overall its fun to play the scorelines do seem to be unrealistic at times but i love how everything has unfolded beautifully in 2015 you have that thrill playing against the rivals and getting new big name player id love it to be bit harder and have some more tactical and traning settings
recommended
certainly one of the more difficult games in the series but easy enough to master after a while ive always been a fan of the championship managerfootball manager games and i cant see that changing any time soon
recommended
i love this game the people who keep saying its bad dont know how to play the game properly its one of the best in years for me
recommended
every year i cant seem to stop playing football manager
recommended
best one yet 5 stars
recommended
i hate this game
recommended
first football manager that i have ever played so i cant really tell if previous games were much betterworse i havent had any bad experiences with the game the game runs smooth no crashes or other errorrelated situations also the diversity and possibilities within the game are good in my opinion i am playing an online mode with a friend of mine which makes the game even more fun never thought i could be so addicted to this game but wowits pretty addictive if i say so
recommended
yeah its good buy it
recommended
i cant enable in game community to access the in game editor can someone help
recommended
core experience remains the same but an upgraded match engine and a few new features make this a worthwhile addition much like its predecessor fm2015 is an evolution of the series rather than a revolution this is both a bad and a good thing the main differences between 2014 are mainly numerous small things that i will not mention here i will mention the two things that stand out to me however 1 match engine this has been in my opinion greatly improved matches seem to flow better there are far more moves goals scored seem mutch more varied and over all it makes it harder to predict the outcome of a move something i found i could do with previous match engines due to having seen the same move over and over again overall i think this is the best 3d match engine they have released 2 layout for some reason they have decided to completly change the layout and all the menus etc this is still pssing me off as the changes seem illogical and now takes me much longer to go to screens than before i can see no reason for the change apart from for changes sake it doesnt make things easier or quicker or more intuitive and generally just slows things down as it can take awhile to dig into sub menu after sub menu to look for the page you want for existing fm2014 fans this may not have enough of a change to warrant a full price purchase but for players of older versions or new players i think the updated match engine do warrant the game for consideration overall i do recommend the game as overall i find the fm series to be excellent however note there are not a massive amount of changes compared to the last release
recommended
with last update i am beging to love the game with proper graphics it almost like fifa 13 graphics in terms of game play but still need improvement the best aspect of this is the scounting aspect you need to get this games in order to experience what i am talking about
recommended
ive been playing this game for 5 years and ill always say  yes to football manager and no to other soccer management simulation games this game have the largest player and stuffs database salaries and characteristics are close to real and the diversity of tactical changes makes us to think in a new way with each new step developers doing football manager more interesting and better the only disadvantage was and still is the graphics of 3d matches but its not the games main component there is no limit to perfection as they say my mark is 9 out of 10
recommended
i ing hate this game
recommended
it is a fun game to play you should get it it is worth the money i have never played at football maneger before but i will be sure to continue
recommended
more of what made the past games great

this is probably the best football manager simulation in the market the game is deep and also quite difficult if you are brave enough to manage lower tier clubs si seem to ix the bugs and there are no game breaking bugs which i have encountered for the football fanatics out there this game is highly recommended

great for any football fan who loves the more tactical approach to football football manager offers great detail without scaring you off by being overcomplicated also there is great choice in game as you can choose to take a lower league or nonleague club and rise to european glory or start at the top and try to retain your position there a great buy
recommended
any true football fan out there would love this game anyone who thinks fifa is realistic will think again after playing this it is not better or worse than fifa because they are such different games fifa for fun with friends or playing with realistic graphics wins every time football manager however is all about sitting on your own for hours and hours working away and taking a side to the top by managing in a realistic and hugely entertaining manner

really enjoying the game right now i like starting with a lower league team and rising them up to the top league im currently playing as stoke after being offered a job there because i promoted york city to the championship loads of possibilities my only issue is that there should be some fmc features in the normal fm mode apart from that good game
recommended
okay i only have 11 hours but i will keep this very simple for you 1 the game is really fun a lot of scoring and cool new animations xd but yes but this game is filled of injuries i just had 3 injuries in one game my replacement for the injured player got injured someone will be out for 45 monmths in the first 5 minutes he injured for another 9 yesars damn

football manager puts your favorite clubs fate into your hands will you get them promoted will you get them relegated will you win the league will you win the european cup these are all questions you must decide before taking hold of your club i took charge of ac milan and was able to win the league 4 times the domestic cup 3 times and the champions league 2 times in 4 years the modding community is great because you can do everything from recreating you favorite childhood players from changing the skin of your game fm is a great addicting game for any passionate fan of the beutiful game and must be respected as such because fm is life
recommended
my review is based on whether its worth upgrading from fm14 i was waiting for fm15 to come out on sale and when it had been patched enough to get rid of most tof the bugs i can never see the point in buying a game at full price when its still buggy especially when its only an update played the free weekend and based on that short time there are some improvements in areas such as layout and graphics the only slightly annoying thing i came across was when i had a friendly cancelled against a chinese side and i could only pick a replacement friendly from minor chinese sides not anywhere else as i could in fm14 in the time that i played i didnt have any injury problems but didnt get enough games in to test that properly still a few quirks in match play but no worse than fm14 though unfortunately no better either personally apart from the updated squads i didnt think it was worth upgrading from fm14 and have decided to wait until fm16 comes out on sale and fully patched of course ive still given this a recommend as if you havent got fm14 then its still a good game and highly adictive

pretty good game as usual very addictive definitely recommend a

updated 24062015 after 70 houts of play it looks amazing game i like this type of games where you are not forced with time and can pause anytime  deep customization  funny dialogs sometimes like when you setup key player on transfer list  multiplayer  good ai  after 70 hours in game super touchy dialogs game feels alive like real manager  after 70 hours in game referee can be paid or blind got refused 2 goals for fake offside  after 70 hours in game very realistic 3d engine moves positioning jumps etc  after 70 hours in game very deep customization which allows to win some crazy matches after 1 miracle goal  very many injuries if your squad works heavily  very many injuries if your squad has no phisio  outdated 3d match graphics looks like 2k or even earlier but fries pc very nicely  no music except inmatch croud note i really recommend you these resources otherwise this game may be not so fun faces httppassion4fmcomfootballmanagerdf11facepacks clubs httppassion4fmcomfootballmanagertcm15logomegapack wiki httpwwwguidetofootballmanagercom wiki httpwwwfootballmanagercommanual

so right i have now played this for 10 hours and although this is not nearly enough time to review a game of this enormity i felt very compelled to write this review on how incompetant the game is as opposed to previous iterations i have started my game thrice as the same lower league team ofcourse i understand that this comes with its difficulties but having 3 players injured after 70 mintues and one of them red carded is simply unacceptable this is an absolute joke and then you have the backroom side of things where players are constantly wanting to criticise my manergerial skills even though we just started the league and we are on a 4 win streak what this game is very polished and the interface and everything is fantastic but the ai and the injury rates are absolutely cated id much rather take a dump in my hands and clap than play this excuse for a game again

a lot of people over the years have hated certain new installments of football manager however for an addict who has been playing since the first cm came out everything is as beautiful as it should be every year  unless you play with the 3d graphics on which is absolutely horrid but then again you can never go wrong with 2d of course there are some bugs during matches and some inequities but when youre a manager you know that life aint fair keep on managing till you cry blood when you score with your underdog team against one of the big guys of football and have that mental  when your months of tactical work pays in the end the best  that has been changed are the ui scouting and the tactics panel i absolutely love the new circular star things over the players in the tactics screen im an fm addict so whatever you give me i will play but those of you who feel the same about it will surely love and play this game anyway we need that fix yo

brilliant game yes injuries are mainly constant but players normally only out for around a week topspeople make it sound like months new patch also has resolved concerns on the bad situation invlolve the defencegoalkeeper highly recommend
recommended
really enjoying this game although there was lots of injuries when i first started i feel like the game is a harder and focuses more on man management for example if your player is unhappy about their contract or the amount of games hes played then he can disrupt the squad unless you sort the problem out overall im enjoying the game my highlight so far has been managing man utd and being 30 down at half time against newcastle at st jamess park before switching to an attacking tactic i created and bringing on james wilson who scored a hattrick in an incredible 43 comeback that included two stoppage time goals

review after update 1503 the game goes much nicer then the first one after this update match engine improvement many bugs been solved though some not fixed yet but its expected since its still on beta cant wait the full release on november 7 i hope by that time most of the remaining bugs or maybe all the bugs are fixed i love the side bar panel on this year version sure need time to get used to it but for me its more simple and nice to see they put much more detail on feature on this year version too like team talk etc many improvement from last year version that i cant write it all but for me its worth to buy it though its still on beta and even more worth to buy after the 1503 update almost 100 hours playtime on two weeks for me that mean this is a game that worth to be in your library if you like to become a football manager

this game is a must have i hate soccer in real life its so boring to watch and i think its one of the worst sports however this game is amazing that it makes me like soccer and makes me want to get into it the realistism of this game from simple stuff like player moral to the more complicated things if only ea sports could do as good of a job as this company does this is way better then football manger 2014 fyi

the sidebar is welcome generally the screen layouts have been much improved however the match engine feels like a bit of a backward step although i understand that its early days for the motioncapture route their taking the one thing that drives me mad the most is the sound of ball being kicked a noise happens every time a player kicks the ball even if its a mere tap a foot a head of them this is most fustrating during intrasquad friendlies when there is no crowd noise to ease the pain

i was really looking forward to playing football manager 2015 on pc as ive always experienced only hanheld version the difference in accuracy and particulars between the two is immediatly noticeable there are two main modalities a simplified one closer to handheld versions and a fullsimulation one suggested to expert fm gamers according to me the game in both modalitites is quite difficult furthermore im really concerned with the fact that i cant find a suitable tactic for my team managers functions are completely outstanding as the give you a wide range of possibilities and in genereal they seem to be close to reality in general the game is really entartaining and amazing with nice 3d graphis that enhance the whole simulation effect in general the game is very nice
recommended
hooked already great game and love most of the changes
recommended
so far this such a great game just downloaded and it is entirely better then any previous versions hands down one of the best football simulations to date

recommended
nice game  after not playing this game since 2008
recommended
first of i have to say that i love the fm series with over 180 hours in fm2012 near 200 in fm2013 and near 400 hours in fm14 i started the game as manchester united and played my first season being crowned champions i believe i have an idea about the game so here are some pros and cons pros the interface takes a while to get use to is great better game engine animations and such new ways to transfer players talking them into it etc scouting makes sense game created youngsters are good potential view is better at scouting cons its hard to sell players talking to the chairmen got harder wonderkids level up in a long time update 2 since the game came out i changed the review 910
recommended
love the game new to the manager series computer and they help you understand everything and give you tips
recommended
loving the beta love the new interface better scouting and training system animation is better except the part where players seem to be skating i dont care worth every penny for the fans of the series if you are new to the seriesgenre then you may wish to wait out the bug fixing phases
recommended
it has many bug on macbook pro osx 1010 yosemite ex every quality of match graphic isnt smooth please deverlop for osx 1010

bought this game yesterday and is playing through the betavery nice interface much better than fm2014 looking very nice cant tell enough as i have only played it for 90 minutes but it looks brilliant as usual
recommended
personally i like the game  finally i can move from fm13
recommended
i rate 88 but seriously though this is a great game for the past two years ive spent way too many hours on football manager games and i reckon this wont be any different yeah there are some problems yeah it could be better in some ways but hey its a brilliant game other than these miniscual problems i fully recommened it to anyone intrested in football as its a game with so much depth you wouldnt beleive pros  detaildepth the database is used by real clubs its accurate addictive you just dont get bored challenging its much more challenging than in recent years interactions its nice to see much more options in interviews 3d match engine yeah its got its problems explained below but its still good new ui design the new user interface is so much easier to navigate give it a couple of hours and youll never want o go back cons  3d match engine the only reason its a problem is if your tactics arent good enough it makes the players make stupid mistakes and can be quite unrealisitic and frustrating but if it was 2d it wouldnt be as bad just because you cant see the mistakes as much just get your tactics right match engine so hard to defend so easy to score expect lots of high scoring games for no reason crashes this has happened 34 times since i got it on the 2910 happens at any time hope it gets sorted soon just set it to save every fortnight and youll be fine so overall another great game which i much prefer over the recent games and fully recommend
recommended
absoutely love the new interface only thing i dont like is that there is a large emphasis on scouting this year much much more so than last years edition
recommended
well after fm 14 i didnt think that m going to buy another fm but i decided to give it another chance and i m proud of my decision even in beta its a better game than fm 14 interface is nice and clean with a lot of information scouting is really good and match engine is really smooth with motion capture even in beta this game is the best fm game ever
recommended
while presenting an extremely innovative and immersive experience of the football management appeal it leaves gamers who are unfamiliar or rookie to the sport in the dark though the game is of high appeal to those who are well versed in the world of english football one could easily advise those who are unfamiliar to steer away this game is not for novices this isnt to say that this lack of equality is a detraction from the game itself  quite the opposite  for those seasoned in english football the game provides a beautiful experience for the hotseat of game management and requires extremely detailed choices for all aspects of the job in order to ensure success both on the field and off
recommended
this game is highly reccommended by me 100% buy the game has had a huge improvement from 2014 and the game has come a long way since it first started 1 huge feature that they have improved is the way your team listen your advice and it can actually make a difference in your new features making it a more realistic manager simulator the wide range of players and team availabe and giving you a chance to choose how much of an experienced manager you are this is a must buy to big football manager fans and dont be dragged into it being a copy of last years version to me it is a huge improvement from 2014 must buy
recommended
this is a really good game ive found it really enjoyable this year the user interface looks really good and ive found myself using sections i wouldnt of touched if not for the sidebar the 3d match engine as always is good but i think fellow fmers expect too much of it this is a football management game and not a football player game so the match engine is not my priority nor should it be sis 910
recommended
best football management game theres is simple as that
recommended
its awesome as long as si fixes the known bugs then it will be legendary hope they keep proactive and updates often
recommended
this is the best fm ive ever played some wonderkids really can make a difference despite of their young age the game machine is getting better
recommended
great game gfx best ever new look is good takes some getting used to but easy to figure out
recommended
its still the classic football manager but the new interface just inst quite as intuiative as the old some good new features but a few bad perhaps i need time to get used to it but i have had to look some things up to work out how to do them there is definate room for improvement not too sure about the role you play as a coach either but that might develop
recommended
i dont know about the negative comments out here but mine is fine and perfectly run smooth i love the new match animation you now can be satisfied when you have player with high technique in your team love it
recommended
buy this game hire roy keane as assistant manager this game have done something completely new to the series it has managed to perfectly capture the personality of roy keane im so amazed at how everything this game makes him say or do matches reality 100% the brutality of his tactical advices his ability to motivate his nononsense way of dealing with reporters also hes a mental coach so theres the fitful juxtaposition roy keane mental in every advice tab ive not had any bugs and everything is running smoothly great game
recommended
i purchased this game two days ago while it was in the beta version and then today clicked to play and had to wait for a download which i assume would be the fully updated game and i have found it is exactly the same as the beta version i am talking about things like the team badges prem leauge in the beta version they are made up and have seen videos on youtube of people playing fm2015 with the teams having the real and correct badges can anyone tell me how this is and where i am going wrongi have looked for another update for the game with no luck the spanish teams have their real crests but most other countries do not so i feel steam have robbed me as i cannot find a way to contact them
recommended
match engine not as good asprevious needs major surgery if it is to succeed
recommended
great as always
recommended
keepers seem to be really slow at reacting and bad back passes are a reoccurring theme but overall a solid game
recommended
the only things i dont like is the skin its very dark i dont like to see the player profile with all that green atributes its not visual apealing and the new scout system seems a little messy in fm 2014 the scouts spent a reasonable time in a task before moving to another in this version they will keep searching until you say oposite if i give 5 tasks to my scout he will only do one he doesnt automaticaly starts another task when he doenst find any nice players besides this the game is awsome as allways it was money well spent
recommended
really dont understand these complaints about high scoring and bad goals id had the game since the beta came out and suffered no such issues ive started a man utd file a spurs file a norwich file and an online southampton file and my only complaint is unrealistic league positions like burnley being 2nd by december or chelsea being 18th for the 1st 2 months of the season ive lost 40 to blackburn in my online file but i can say that was due to me throwing together players who werent tired from a mid week game maybe im one of the rare lucky experiences but the concept of football manager is to build a team with your tactics and your players you cant just make a tactic and throw players together without them playing together for a couple of months regularly chopping and changing disrupts the chemistry of the team thats why there is a bar to determine how comfortable your team is with all tactics and formations i agree that defending can be non existent at times but again you just need the correct player and team instructions to put this right
recommended
the game is quite good some new features but why you change things without a reason just to change something what i dont like 1 tactics screen these drop down boxes really bad idea chaos 2 new skin and colors fm2014 had a good skin and colors improved from version fm2013 if something is good dont change it just to add something new 3 i dont use 3d engine but it looks fine however players still swim or fly on a pitch animations still really poor to si if you could change these tact screen and add a new skin and normal colors would be great one more thing si i think that after all these years you could get more licences hyyy if ea can whats the problem still worth to buy
recommended
good game love the series and this game has been very enjoyable to all those talking about highscore lines its football in football there are all kinds of scorelines if your a fan buy it of course it has its issues but si do patch the games its a well supported game
recommended
great
recommended
new ui is very good seems that there is a lot of matches with too many goals too easy to score and concede
recommended
it all comes together after years of being a wierd disjointed experience
recommended
well its obviously much improved from last year fm edition improved gui which need sometime to navigate through much improved scouting etc that was exciting but of course it can still improve for the upcoming weeks
recommended
decent sports sim game does have the drawbacks of quiet a steep price for what youre getting due to a certian amount of repetitivness all in all a fun game though and if youre into football and want something different to fifa 15 a decent buy

i was always a bit nervous about the releasing of a new version of this game ive played all of these since 2010 but the last two versions of the game were pretty disappointing always best soccerfootball management games on the market though and im pretty happy to say that this year the game is good also at the current update it have a nicer design is more realistic they have improved the player market still more work should be done on this and the game is faster to sim i always liked sim games but i think the better game by si was ehm 2007 this because it was funny great still best hockey simmanagement game on the market and really fast i dont really understand why they give you all the rosters teams and championships of the world if you cannot select more than 1015 of them with the rest of the world that remain silence no players no offer for your players what i really miss is an option to fast simulate championships as ehm 2007 give you as an option i prefer to lost a little and also more of info but be able to sim a world however this year the game as improved much in this sense you still have to be able to play on a nice system but im currently sim all the default teams excepts from asia with a small database and the game seems smooth i dont know if can be worth to add asia and mods for new championships as the game suffer from a great deterioration of sims speed if you play with more of 120000 players 140000 are still good really recommended

over 200 hours into fm 2015 and more than 1000 of hours in its predecessors i find myself surrounded by over 50 football shirts of obscure teams i managed on the game my degree has been delayed for two years now but i am 17 matches unbeaten in new caledonia
recommended
at the time of posting fm 15 has very few bugs after a poor release and is now at the point where anyone who was holding off on getting it should pick it up
recommended
good game defending is a bit wonky and ai offers and agrees to player swaps way more than in reality
recommended
great improvement on graphic this year
recommended
great game
recommended
better then 2014 thats for sure
recommended
its awesome
recommended
the graphics look solid and the gameplay is so smooth but only bad thing is set pieces because i use manu and i conceded 24 set pieces from 26 goals that i conceded but apart of that everything alright9
recommended
i like the game itd be nice if steam could take a long walk of a short cliff though as its ruddy obstructive and annoying when it stops me playing stupid software
recommended
good game plays well there arent too many injuries as some have suggested nor is it too difficult with a well devised tactic and a solid training plan success is very possible having said that there is now a bug that prevents the loading of the game at all steam yet again is proving to be an utter abortion of an application why on earth im compelled to use this third party trash to load my game is completely beyond me
recommended
great game i played so far the new design is refreshing giving a new hole experience on this amazing saga of conquests
recommended
great game
recommended
this version of football manager is much more realistic in terms of the match engine people have been saying that scorelines are very large and unrealistic but that has not happened with me i concede about a goal a match and that is normal i do not see huge scorelines even in other leagues there are occassional blowouts like 62 or 50 but tht happens in real football matches too i mean so far this season real madrid beat deportivo 82 and sunderland lost to southampton 80 so these blowouts are normal and happen every season the scouting ystem is way better than in fm 14 and the whole face of fm 15 is revamped and looks so much better the only complaint i have is sometimes it is hard to fing things like how to demote a player to my u21s or how to search for staff other than that its a complete and fun game to play 810
recommended
cant seem to get started again after beta version but was good upto that point
recommended
its football manager
recommended
this game is a must buy
recommended
overall the best fm gameplay ever  im hooked on to this fm15
recommended
not sure there are bug or not but average booked 4yellow card per match wth btw overall still is a good game
recommended
sound game if your a fan of the fm series then your sure to like this game the game continues to progress each year although there is only slight change it does make a much more beneficial outcome

the fixes have been excellent and fm 15 is a fantastic game

great game if this is what you are into football club simulator basically at its core when you get into it you keep wanting to see what happens after the next match wish i had more time to play
recommended
i would heavily reccomend this years version of football manager in my opinon it is quite a bit better than last years version the bugs in the match engine have been fixed and it plays better than ever the new ui is nice and slick very useable and saves me a lot of time the biggest improvement is the scouting system though its much more dynamic and genuinley interesting compared to before
recommended
i recommend this game i love football maneger and this one its one of the best some bugs of course but nothing to worry about with
recommended
while no significant changes since fm2014 its a worthy improvement especially with the new ui some of the earlier issues have been addressed by the latest updates but still the defensive  crossing aspect of the game engine seems rather flawed also the motivational man management of the squad can be rather annoying to deal with its just a matter of learning the best responses to the relevant question scouting has been much improved in terms of realism over recent incarnations of the franchise worth buying but not an essential purchase 710
recommended
overall very decent good upgrade to 13 although the game time sideline chat feels like it doesnt have much affect easy to explore good menu design and new report page with strengths and weaknesses comes in handy
recommended
a must for true football passionees  passionate people 
recommended
would defonately recommend to the fellow football fan
recommended
ive played football manager for years and its always slightly tweeked from the previous edition however fm15 is totally different love that you can shout at your players mid half and the choice of what you can say is good buying and selling players is harder but it is easier to win matches cos you have more control of your tactics ill give it 8510

just buy it simple as best game ever one downside is since i started playing fm when i got fm 12 i have been put on the missing presumed dead list rip social life

i want to be a football manager not an accountant i went blackburn and was doing well but the club were in debt as soon as i took over so i got rid of some players but it only made a slight dent in the overall debt long story short board blamed me even though i hadnt purchased any players club went into administration so got 10 points so dropped from 2nd to 11th midway through season the game gave me no chance at all to sort the financial state of the club the game should have stated at the beginnig that blackburn will go into administration unless you sell all of your best players then i would have picked a team that would actually be fun to play worst thing about it is that when i was choosing a team to control it said that their finances were okay cant be bothered with it now waste of money my time and developers need to take a reality check
not recommended
not funny game and its cost so much p
not recommended
all the functions in the main menu are complex and up to date but as this is not a fifa recognised gamethe teams have wrong names and logosthe game play is worse than two cpu controlled teams playing each other in fifa 06 on a nintendo ds i would recommend total football manager 2005 by ea sports insteadmay not be available on the steam store
not recommended
i am playing the series since 1997 so i have a clear view of the game proggression through the years although i just bought my copy i can say that there are some really interesting changes like scouting reports the new 3d etc its a great game as you always expect from si sure there are some things that can be fixed with patches but i have to admit i am also worried about the injuries in my first game month my team already has 6 injuries and all of them are 6 weeks if that is some kind of bug and not just bad reallistic luck then i am sure it will be fixed in the next few weeks with a patch or update
recommended
i love this game i would also recommend to anybody that likes to play the game as relalisticly as possible to google mods for this game there are alot of mods that are not on steam workshop that are very easy to put in and it helped my gaming experence fm15 > fm14 all the way
recommended
new patch urgently change the match engine to make the game playable
recommended
i see all these negative reviews about fm 2015 and i strongly disagree with most of them first of all yeah there are a decent amount of injuries during a season i played quite a few seasons and after looking the average amount of injuries that occure both ingame and in real i must say it has been made quite realistic the amount of injuries i got a season appear to be just below the average in real so i must say this is quite good the amount of own goals has been a big complaint aswell but compare it with the amount the average top team of each league gets it is just a bit more than in real that is mainly because in real they dont count everything a own goal that has been last touched by a defending player while fm 2015 does i could go on for a while with ruining peoples their complaints but in general this version of fm is better than all of the previous ones the menu is amazing now and the possibilities are endless
recommended
good game better then 14 more tactiacally involved buy players want too much money and clubs want to much money for a player
recommended
they should actually try to make a good 3d so we could watch the games instead of just reading the comments or watching balls vs balls p and the injuries  anyway i enjoy 90% of the time playing it so its cool 
recommended
ive already bought the game but when i go onto steam i cant load the game up does anyone know what i can do
recommended
good information
recommended
its annoying that it gives away some bad goals rarely though but apart from that fm15 is a great game
recommended
bought this game after the december update and regarding the problems many other customers have complained about below i have to say after four full months of the first season i havnt had any problems with crazy amounts of injuries and the match engine is not producing crazy results its not a perfect game i think if the developers spent more time and effort on it then the game could be what it should be in the year 2015 after the 23 years of product development time theyve had since i first played cm on my amiga 500 back in the day not to get to long winded  in my opinion its the best version ive played yet but it should have been this good in 2001 pros  steam workshop fast gaming experience relative to previous versions lots of options not neccessarily overly complicated match engine is capable of the beautiful game at times and does manage to elicit strong emotions in me did i mention steam workshop cons  gks sometimes go mindless for a few seconds in match engine leading to fantasy breaking silly goals this happens maybe once every three games having to always watch the kick offs and final whistle highlights in match engine even if nothing interesting happens about once a game in the match engine a pointless highlight will show and last too long even though nothing interesting is happening
recommended
same game as the last couple of years its a little better with the newest patch but a lot of things still dont matter  the teamspeeches dont seem to do anything or you get negative results from it even though the game says you should say that to them  clubs controlled by the game buy up all of the best players and then dont even let them play making it very diffecult for you to create a team that can win big prices the players how go to those clubs and the after a year are put on the transferlist dont want to move to your club because they are playing at a better club even though they didnt play a single match  scouting uses a system where you can see what percentage your knowledge of a player 0100% is but there is no option in the scoutingmenu to say scout to a 100% and even then at 100% sometimes the players potential still isnt completly scouted  when asking the board to raise the salarycap for staff members it gets raised by 200 euros which isnt nearly enough to get any improvements  whenever one of your players get injured during a match its never the games fault it never gives itself a red or even a yellow card but you get red cards constantly  still cant reload my save during matches its an offline singleplayer game if i want to reload my save during a match who cares these are the main problems and yet its still very addictive the best football management game out there and i cant stop playing
recommended
me likes nice tweaks and updates from previous titles nothing groundbreaking perhaps but solid update and in my opinion worth the yearly upgrade
recommended
when i try to load my saved game it just comes up with cannot load saved game
recommended
ive owned cmfm since the early nineties and would reccomend this edition its a big improvement on last years edition match engine is better than its been for a while football manager classic has also improved and is a welcome break from the full fat edition a bit like the cm of old that was fast paced biggest con is still the media press conferences been in the game for a while now and they are complete crap
recommended
ooohh guys i havent seen enough of 3d match and playing to criticize injuries but tactical window is really awfull i am playing fm for three years and learned a lot of hints that use but i cannot cast overall team picture first of all it regarding player roles team in tactics window looks like a heap of scrap i failed to set up player roles through it new image of correspondece skills and position needs to measure with a scale it very uninformative second tactics windows on a match on my 15 display i see only part of player skills when try to find him optimal role its very very uncomfortably dear developers please fix it on the next patch but early will be better reccomendation is advance curse of fm that before third path  game is really different to play good luck we trust in you

multiplayer works flawlessly in my experience playing with 3 friends everything outside of the match engine is significantly improved over last year the match engine is worse than ever with odd goalkeepers lots of injuries and extremely glitchy gameplay when playing online its really funny to see how awful the stadiums celebrations and general gameplay is and its still a great rpg in single player its considerably more frustrating but it makes for some funny stories and there isnt a better alternative if you want a realistic footballsoccer simulation this isnt it its not even close however you really arent going to do any better and you will still get over 500 hours out of it if its your kind of thing

everyone that is giving this game bad reviews is clearly just rubbish at it ive been a hardcore football manager player for years and this is by far the best yet mastered it hope all these with rubbish reviews get better at the game before leaving bad reviews 
recommended
quite different from the earlier versions and will take some time to adapt some new fixes but all in all it feels more or less just like an updated version of fm14 with transfers etc would still recommand unless you have higher expectations to the game
recommended
no problems with the game really good setup and layout
recommended
started with football manager 2013 just out of curiosity one of the top played games on steam being a soccer management game lolwut since then ive been hooked though this series continues to be the best management simulation game ive ever experienced and this year only gets better match engine and tactics are far better than in 2014 from what ive experienced so far and its a great game overall like always
recommended
first off i want to say that i was in two minds about getting this game reviews from the fans didnt seem very positive and as this game has a great community and fan following i was quite shocked the main criticism has been the frequency of injuries from what i have seen this is not even true if anything ive seen fewer injuries than in previous versions i have been looking closely to see this so called injury problem yet ive never seen more than two key players being injuried at one time and not even for very long its overall a great and addicting game and my favourite yet if im honest however the match engine although improved is quite poor and freak goalkeeper mistakes dont seem all that freak anymore as they occur quite a few times each season however im pretty sure the match engine isnt much to go by the commentary sometimes says completely different things to what the match engine shows  eg player shoots really wide but the commenary claims it was almost in this isnt much of a problem in all honesty and if you had commentary on only you wouldnt ever notice the new menu layout is really good in my opinion and finding what i want to do is now much easier and quicker making me actually pay more attention to tactics training and scouting which i have often ignored to a large extent in previous games overall id say this game is great and the series is still going strong so glad i got this game i would advise you buy it too
recommended
top game in the world  1111
recommended
its one of the best football games hands down

overall fm15 is a good game different from fm14 providing different tactics and new ways of training there are also some improvements regarding press conferences they are shorter compared to fm14 and the question variety is greater touchline team talks was also a good addition and the overall general layout is technically easier than fm14 saying that though if you are an experienced fm player be prepared to take a while to get used some minor details such as making a player avaliable to the under 21 squad is under the development tab instead of a squad tab the 3d match engine is slightly better however sometimes the goalkeepers do not behave like real goalkeepers in the 3d match engine not diving sometimes the keeper slides across on his two feet to save a shot instead of diving other than that it is an improvement however the game by default does not have badges or logos or many player faces you have to download that yourself the tactics are technically more straight foward if your new to fm you may find them easier compare to previous fms however if you are experienced it will take a while getting used to the changes to conclude i would reccomend the game however it is not a big improvement to 14 and it may perhaps be better to wait for 16 or wait for more updates however if you do decide to buy it it is still worth it
recommended
absolutely baffled by some of the negative comments about the game ive not played fm since fm 12 so maybe the minor improvements over the years impress me more than most i agree that the training is a liitle poor and needs work and i have only played 15 hours but overall ive found the game very good its not outstanding like the earlier versions but it is always going to be difficult to develop it so far forward without ruining the gaming or changing it beyond recognition so far i havent had any major issues with injuries and the match engine is fine with no silly mistakes and goals from all over the pitch if youve not played fm for a while like myself then buy it but it appears if you have been buying it year in year out then maybe you need to take a break away from the keyboard get some fresh air a bit of sun and come back to it in a year or two oh and some places sell the game for 20 which isnt a lot really
recommended
i hate the issue of syc cloud for my save game i have been playing on 2 computers and i never get syn for my save file and do not tell me about setting that click on that little check box i have done hate this problemmmmmmmmmm

there really is no game on the market that puts you more into the situation of being someone you are not of giving you the role of a manager of involving you in the day to day trials and minutia of that job and aside from that this years version though weirdly under publicised for some reason is a comparatively huge leap forward for the franchise and i would reccommend it to anyone  even if you have zero interest in football hell im not even a fan of football myself  its just that the tactical depth of this game is unsurpassed by anything else out there most importantly for fans of the series the overhaul on the match engine this time has really made games a joy to watch touchline instructions following advice from your assistant are vastly more intuitive the tactics editor is finally streamlined and comprehensive and the old tooltips system has been replaced by a novel and extremely usefull  help system it isnt without small faults the random training injuries this year can seem extreme your best player can be out for a season for being injured whilst picking his nose i know footballers are pansies but come on experienced players will find that it takes some adjusting to familiarise yourself with where everything is despite all the help and information now made available some of the player interactions whilst they certainly make things more interesting just arent that likely  getting totally raged on by one of your players simply because he does not play in every single game can snowball into him deliberately infecting the rest of the team and the board sacking you and again i find this a little extreme also the new ability to use social media doesnt work quite the way it should and is heavilly biased toward google despite its many tiny flaws this years version is far better than any that have gone before the negative reviews from long term fans are in my opinion written by people who do not like change regardless of what you think about the series this is the best fm game there is 90%
recommended
i have only played this game a little bit but its ok
recommended
enjoying the new layout although its taking a little longer than i expected to adjust the game does seem to be a bit harder than 2013 and 2014 which is good

recommended
its a great game im really enjoying it only down side that i find extremely annoying is how difficult it is to buy top class players the value of some is shocking for example im chelsea into the third season with around 77 mil to spend i attempt to buy suarez he is valued at 22 million i offer 50 mil and oscar for him there reply is they want 200 mil lol this has happened with every world class player i attempt to buy even ross barkley cost me near 60 mil put apart from that its an enjoyable game and very addictive buy it in the sales
recommended
i bought this game a little while after its release and have to say i had some issue initiallyi think its very very different from earlier games and that was an initial turn off but now iam abit more into it i think its wonderfulas addictive and fluid as ever time to change my underwear as before 
recommended
good games
recommended
such an addictive game once you get in to it great fun getting a low team into the top league
recommended
i absolutely love this game
recommended
great game
recommended
i havent played since fm13 and im happy so far very addictive nice layout and easy setup having a lot of trouble in the transfer market so far but its still only the first season on it so im hoping to figure that out would recommend 
recommended
the game definitely has some issues but it is still your bog standard footy manager and i am enjoying it
recommended
great great game best football manager i have had and i have had 5
recommended
i saw rather a lot of negative reviews for this complaining not enough has changed or been added from previous additions this is the issue with sports games we predominantly pay for the transfer window update and a new skin but with the return of the side bar better player interactions and the weight of your decisions being more important than ever  football manager 2015 is just as addictive before and im sure i will sink many more hours into this until 2016 version is released with updated transfers and a new skin ultimately this is the best thing to sink hours into and with no alternative and its much better than fifa for management sims this is as good as it gets
recommended
its better than 2014 version
recommended
reading all the negative reviews of the game i thought id come and give my two cents ive played fm since the 2005 edition and fm15 is my favourite iteration yet the game makes you feel now more than ever like youre in charge of a football team that is composed of individuals not spreadsheets here are the pros and cons ive found so far pros player management has been revamped this year and players behave more realistically than ever you cannot sign a player on a key player wage not play him and expect him to be satisfied if you drop him for no reason additionally other players in the squad may side with him and make your position untenable resulting in you getting sacked for losing the dressing room or on the contrary complain about you treating him too kindly if you give in to his demands players going to the press will also get picked up a lot more and you will be facing insistent and often annoying questions on how youre handling the player in question this leads me to the next pro improvements to media handling anyone who complains about the increase in media occasions from fm14 must not know that you can give over control of media handling to your assistant handling the media is a key part of any managerial job and i appreciate the fact that si have tried to make it feel as real as ever having a pesky journo run after me in the tunnel after a  performance i found myself snapping at him which shows how effective adding these rather small features has been at enhancing the experience of managing a football club the match engine is a lot prettier than earlier versions the interface while it takes some getting used to is great and feels a lot crispier than earlier versions small decisions like splitting staff and player searches into the staff and scouting categories make the game easier to navigate scouting has been vastly improved and it is now easier than ever to make the scouts suit your needs rather than them giving you reports you dont want to see the option to have them scout leagues for specific player types such as a replacement for an ageing first team player or a promising youngster also add to the organic feel of the game cons although the match engine has been tweaked since the release it still needs a bit of work crossing and long shots by players who given their attributes really have no business hitting 30 yard screamers 5 times a season still exist although theyre being worked on injuries seem to happen in waves where youll spend 6 months injury free and then have 5 players get long term injuries in the same week its frustrating but again the last patch did introduce changes to injury probabilities it just needs to be tweaked a bit although i enjoy the new interface the tactics screen absolutely sucks and needs to be changed in future patches the star for the players comfort in that position and circle around it to indicate suitability compared to the rest of the squad in particular is hideous if its that difficult to describe in writing then it shouldnt be a feature those are the major gripes i have on the game the losing against promoted teams when youre on a 5 game win streak may be frustrating but if you look at real life football thats often what happens teams who perform well against strong opposition may get complacent and slip up against minnows the fact of the matter is that if you love football no game out there will allow you to experience the beautiful game quite like fm15 does the changes arent perfect but theyre there and si has patched issues that the playerbase found with the game and say what you will about them theyre passionate about football and really care about their game which game dew do you know who would go and get written permission from a 15 year old wonderkids parents just so they could put him in the game and let players see how he turns out the game is far from perfect but ive put dozens of hours into it so far and have enjoyed every second of it i cant review fm classic as i dont touch it but the fully simulated experience is as close to managing a football club as youll ever get without going into the profession yourself 910
recommended
very addictive ignore stereo types
recommended
its ok  it can sometimes make you happybut alot of times really really angryi would reccomend it but the most id pay 4 it would be 25$
recommended
really addictive with several improvements than last version good work si
recommended
this game in a word is addictive i find myself losing hours to this spreadsheet simulator which to all my better judgement seems to be a random number generator which calculates football scores completely detatched from the rest of the tactical managerial business behind the scenes and yet there is a chance that the tweaks you make to the team that lost 21 last time away to brentford would transform the team into chelsea beaters and take you to the fa cup final and win glory for your beloved team and that emotional empathy this game creates is as close to the real thing as watching a real football match on the tv superb
recommended
this game is awful in my opinion unless you buy all of the dlcs waste of 30 dont make the same mistake i did
recommended
football manager needs strong rivals just like a serious football team while the fm isnt the most innovative and most impressive game around its still the best football management title 810 would recommend
recommended
i cant even have a possession more than 60% with a possession base tactics and why is that
recommended
best football manager experience you will ever get worth every bit of your money
recommended
i got a newgen player called prince mohamed that is all

buy luis suarez for chelsea for 110m scores against liverpool at the kop end and celebrates in front of the liverpool fans brilliant
recommended
nice game for i am playing
recommended
football manager 2015 is extremely addictive one of those games you can play for hours and still have fun and is very easy to work with even if youre a beginner id suggest this game for those who enjoy football as a sport of just watching it

enough of the bad review and thumbs down this game absolutely briliant since many people talk about buggies or  i have to tell you that was wrong the dev really made a great patch no more injuries really bad defending keepercentre back etc theres a great tactic made by people who appreciate this game i used his tactic got ucl trophy league champions three peatetc that means this game not  you just need patience 1010 best fm game ever
recommended
thank you sports interactive for supplying with my latest yearly dosage of stress and sleep deprivation my goalkeeper could not catch ebola in sierra leone and my midfielders do as good a job of controlling the ball as the world health organisation controlling the spread of it same thing as every year but will still play it because i am hopelessly addicted and socially frustrated 2110
recommended
football manager 2015 does feel like a siginificant improvement from 2014 which respectively wasnt that much different from 2013 or 2012 they added more animations when in game which is cool but i still dont understand how on my save messi has not won the ballondor for 4 years he isnt like he is in real life which is strange whatever still good you should buy it probably or dont like i care
recommended
oh god i don have a life now i am doom stuck to this game
recommended
where do i begin i have been trough it all lately inevitable injuries to key players constant leaking goalies the ridiculous crossing goalies 74 defeats to nonleague teams that i should have stomped on and of course some disasterous defending by my players ai but still i come back to it again and again hitting my head against the same bloody brick wall day after another and for some reason it has worked i have had couple of saves which have gone fantastically so far the ai still is kinda  but way better than at launch new additions such the sidebar and more indepth scoutin have taken a another small step towards realism and i feel like the abnoxious pre and after game journalist mlestations are easier to handle so i am going to give it a recommendation for what it is but please make the game properly and dont leave it all for beta testers to get trough i had one save on the beta and it was abnoxious and almost unplayable it might have ruined the game for some players before it even came out
recommended
there just werent enough changes for me one thing i wouldve liked to have seen is the ability to practise set pieces on the last fm i used to concede from corners a lot i wouldve liked the opportunity to set up a defence vs attack scenario and seen how it played out and then tweaked my instructions based on that apart from the skin and the tracksuit manager element from what i can see from the beta is that nothing much has changed i appreciate that you dont want to mess with the format too much but there is scant reason to get excited about this update
recommended
better and easier to use ui better match engine with more realistic movement more tactic and role choice
recommended
fm at its best
recommended
as always a briliant game never fails to impress at all
recommended
told my family pets and friends that i would not be renewing their contracts got fired needs patching 1510

wellin my history of gaming i was playin all the fm serieseven the championship onesso farthis one is the best sure it has some glitchesbut what game doesnt really anywaysi only have 17 hours played so far but im going onthe best thing is the 3d enginegame looks more realisticits more fun to watchit works really wellso far didnt had any isues like other people wrotesecond thing i like are the tacticswellyou cant really expect fireworks with any team just at the startsure maybe with the best teams like fc bayern or realbarcelonabut f you are persistant with your tactic and the board also ofcthen you will see some good stuff at the end well im not gona talk to much nowi will be writing again when i reach 100 hours of playin itbut so far thumbs up worth every penny
recommended
its horrors arent to be taken lightly the obsession the addiction the wasted months the sleepless nights as you strategically weigh up transfers and tactics and finally that tearstrewn crackofdawn moment when you realise you just cant take it anymore your finger trembling over the mouse as you finally click delete football manager is nothing more than page upon page of statistical data offset with the occasional virtual match that you cant actually control but to the many fans of the sport it inspires an infatuation unrivalled in the world of video games a feeling of power and control not unlike that of the civilization series but on a more realistic and micromanaged scale you take charge as head manager of your favourite football team and through player and staff purchases regular training plenty of tactical planning and the occasional bit of luck you can guide them to fulfilling victory  or frustrating loss unlike its playable football counterpart in the fifa series developer sports interactive has year after year ensured that its latest iteration is always a significant overhaul of the previous edition bringing back compulsive fans not just with updated rosters but through key feature changes and additions this years fm2015 release has a host of updated features aside from the updated 3d match engine graphics on game day the true highlight is the option to choose between being a tracksuit manager and a tactical manager the two often overlapping in previous editions here the choice between getting deeply involved in either the training or strategies is an important factor not just in the gameplay but in how players and staff react to you as a leader the only real problem with this truetolife recreation is that accuracy is occasionally taken too far such as in the unfocused but essential meetings regular chats with your staff and press are required to place your team at the forefront of this moneycontrolled world but it often comes at the expense of entertainment its true that realism should be the goal but a balance is necessary especially when repetition starts to set in fm15 doesnt break new ground but it does build on a decadesold formula to ensure your life will soon be dominated by a delusionfilled virtual world of fictional players fake matches and simulated football management

i purchased this last night and had only a brief time to play around with it after reading all the negative reviews from users i was a bit hesitant but from what ive read si patches the games well i decided to purchase and jumped into classic mode with chelsea right way this is the first fm i have purchased i was expecting all these injury bugs and high scores and after my first game i thought here we go as i won 50 i played 5 games and tried to sign 2 players in my brief time scores for the 5 games are as follows 50 w 30 w 03 l 31 w 01 l as far as i can tell the scores dont look out of whack 1 player rejected me the other player failed his medical kinda cool as for injuries yes there were some injuries but a lot of them were knocks and nothing really major i had a couple of major injuries but by major i mean they missed 11days to 2weeks time and were back in my first squad thats the point of building a solid squad and having backups that can step in same as real football id say its on par with fifa 2015 in terms of injuries and score lines i set my tactics and i quick picked my squad each game so that i could just get through i will play a new season upcoming just wanted to get the feeling for the game anyway since im not a veteran to fm i cant say if this is an upgrade or downgrade to previous iterations but i can say that ive stopped playing certain games madden cod because of their repetition and non improving of game play awful sentence i know so i can see both sides of the coin for now i enjoy this game and hope to continue to enjoy it the real names  face packs  logo packs  kit packs that other users have created definitely help also having any league and any team available unlike fifa is a joy hope to put in plenty of more hours

recommended
first time ive been addicted to football manager since it changed from champ man
recommended
some good additions little change but they produce a decent game every year was buggy at the start but im have no issue now
recommended
the game was great if you play 20142013 its fm2015 basically the interface change roughly like it by the side but i got a question is it grey and black because its in beta hahah
recommended
the best version yet many great new additions the tactical side is more realistic and you need to make sure you get everything done properly from fitness especially in preseason to training and motiation to tactics or youll struggle to win i have completed my first season and did the double the best new addition though is australias ffa cup
recommended
only minor changes from last years game match engine definitly needs fixing as defending is nonexistantoverall though i would still say this is the best football management sim out there
recommended
currently slightly buggycrashy but it is still in beta and have upmost faith it will work perfectly within a couple of patches once again a great game with extra features a definite upgrade from fm 14
recommended
steam is the worst platform ive ever come across on the internet its criminal that eidos make you use it ive paid for a game but for some reason am not allowed to use it completely useless

footballs not just about scoring goals  its about winning alan shearer the moment when i become the best manager in the world with my beloved team  priceless <3 after 700h pros  lighter engine  significantly fewer crash dumps  managers profile  rest cons  sidebar  so stupid muddled management options  crimean national team a great shame for the sisega subjective rate a but still this is my beloved game series except baldurs gate <3

just as good but need to work out how to get onto transfer list as cant seem to find it
recommended
it is footballl management game very rarely are there bugs in the game new ui is good and some cool features added to this game enjoy football want to try your hand at management try this it is worth the investment
recommended
i love this years football manager everything is ok for me i have no problems with injuries or matchday engine dont know why other people have problem with it
recommended
i personally have found football manager 2015 to be a much better game than 2014 on the whole positives more realistic gameplay the footballers dont repeatedly try to shoot from impossible angles the game flows better and feels much more like a real game of football negatives certain bugs on linux hotkeys and window switching issues the game feels a lot easier than 2014 ive started as southampton and went unbeaten for 2 months not impossible but this did include competition like arsenal and liverpool who i beat 41 and 42 respectively i would reccommend this game definitely it is very fun and well worth 30 while it feels slightly unfinished it feels like it will be perfected next major patch though
recommended
yes the game has a better flow about it this year
recommended
great game
recommended
love this game so far engine may be a little bit buggy at the moment but i expect them to fix that definitely recommend picking it up
recommended

very good update to a good game
recommended
the ui takes a lot of getting used to even if youre a veteran fm player even the best players in the world seem to struggle to play properly for some reason i dont believe they really went above and beyond with fm15 but it is still an addition to the franchise its decent but not leaps and bounds above fm14 if you are just getting into the series pick it up if you already own fm14 and want a new challenge its pretty good for that too i would recommend it
recommended
i bought the beta version and i dont have the codehelp

football manager 15 at its best
recommended
i have been a long time player of the championship mananerfootball manager series since the very first game was released and over the last coupld of years i have slowly waned from enjoying the games but this year something has reignited the bug in me again and i am loving the grind of taking my teams to glory i would love to explain what it is in the game that has got me back in love but i cant i think it is just the little tweaks to certain areas that have done it for me
recommended
great game tooo many people crying on here on how its a bad game some have valid reasons but others are just being sore losers
recommended
probably one of the best games ive played in awhile fm14 tho
recommended
like the games
recommended
i have made rochdale afc a big club now and its been awesome the game deserve 1010
recommended
i spent a whole damn half an hour sitting in menus with my friend doing absoutely nothing because there was no tutorial or anything we just sat in menus for 30 minutes doing nothing wanting to play some freaking football apparently football is too much of a complicated sport for people to play on the computer this game should be called menu simulator
not recommended
this is the worst game i have ever played in my life i highly recommend that you do not buy this game
not recommended
possibly one of the worst games i have ever played biggest load of  going i wanted to manage bristol rovers but i got ing afc telford which must stand for absolute ing  telford i got it for free but i would pay a single ing penny i wouldnt even give it to some one as a joke  joke might as well be corrupt like fifa
not recommended
cool game bruh
recommended
not as good as fm2014 but still a good game
recommended
one of the worst game of the series too many matches finish with defeat despite your dominance you cant help it no matter what you do cant keep your players if youre playing with a lower reputation team you let your player leave other players are like how can you let him go  you dont let your player leave other players are like you shouldve let him go how can you do this to him  injuries are ridicilous match engine is a joke dont buy this crap i wanted to have some fun had brain haemorrhage instead they ruined this one i actually want my money back
not recommended
this is the worst fm of all time i think the designers should burn in hell
not recommended
great game its a must buy for all football fans
recommended
it gets better every year very addictive
recommended
absolutely in love with this game this is the first football manager i have played and i have no regrets 100% worth the 3499 ive played the gameplay is great i love how the game is set out like i said its the first football manager ive played and it was so easily to learn where everything was and how to use it i uise an apple mac to play this addicting game and i must say it is extremely quick ive had no major problems at all downloaded super fast i believe it only took a few minutes to actually instal which is awesome as i couldnt wait to get stuck in however i only have one incy wincy problem which annoys me a little i dont know if its just me but it seems after the first season it gets rather difficult to achieve expectations and not get sacked like i said i dont know if that is just me i mught just be bad at this game but im not too sure i started my first season with portsmouth and got promoted to league 1 but the next season they expected me to be promted again to the championship and gave me around 14m to spend realistically i thought this was impossible i was right so the next season after that they only gave me 250k so that really wasnt near enough the budget i had in mind i ended up resigning and joined middlesbrough for a season i completely flopped and only got a mid table finish predicted promotion i got the sack unsuprisingly and then joined cardiff they also expected promotion which i failed so now im on my second season with cardiff and ive tried so many different tactics and none of them seem to work im obnly around 10games in but im doing so bad my team is by far the best in the championship yet it doesnt seem to perform but still like i said i dont know if its just me or not finally this is probably the best game ive ever invested in as well as fifa even through it gets frustrating at times you still come back ever day and play a few more games very sorry for rambling on but i hope you all find this helpful if you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to buy this game just like me then get it you wont regret it
recommended
one of the best football management sims out there actually challenging to get a team to work properly together a proper simulation game also i love it how si still improve the game how they listen to peoples complaints about bugs on their forums and actively seek to improve their game not all companies would fully support their games for a whole year
recommended
1010 broked my pc after this d
recommended
great game its improved alot
recommended
while this game brings the level of detail to new levels it still begs the same of question of when have you won when are you at the end and thus you always end up walking away when you realise there is no natural conclussion
recommended
this game is like more complicated than the real management of football and also more enjoyable although i havent managed any real team yet 
recommended
love this games worldclass
recommended
so i have played fm15 after previously having the 2013 and 2008 versions when i got my self on the 2013fm i saw a lot of changes between it and 2008 the 2015 hardly brought any changes at all there are maybe 2 or 3 new speches in team talk some more advanced conversations with players which are actualy harder to talk to and overal the personal chat has been developed yes theres also a 3d game play shown rather than 2d which actualy does not add anything to a manager expirience and in my opinion is nice but unnecesary there are few minor bugs with the game theres also a fair play requirements to get into european competitons but other than that theres not a lot of new suprises this is still my favourite football manager game but other than few little changes updated squads and competition rules this game is preety much the old 2013 manager to me its still a good game worth a buy if your upgrading your football manager 610 just because i expected a bit more new features 1010 if this is going to be your first one or much older than 2013
recommended
not sure what all the negative feedback is about i think this is a good addition to an aready great series the new player attribute style is alot better than the old everything greyed out of before the ability to have your team captain help you with player morale issues etc the match engine has been fine with me and ive logged 54 hours so far
recommended
love this game will steal your life

best simulator in the universe 
recommended
game has alot of potential but too many goals being conceded from set pieces for me at the moment
recommended
standard great game as always from si
recommended
goalies are a bit slow
recommended
this game is great i rate 88 m8
recommended
rewiew for badge 
recommended
play first game get 5 injuries 1110

i dont understand why so many negative reviews i havent found anything bad this is my first ever time playing any football manager and i found it farely easy to understand the only problem is when they take corners theyt stand there for about 510 seconds but then they go back to normal but then its fine for ages great game
recommended
another great edition of the most complete management game for both on the pitch tactics and off the pitch man management steam workshop just makes this so much better buy play love
recommended
just one more game just one more contract renewal just one more scout report prepare for just one more after the previous just one more highly addictive very user friendly interface a good guide for newcomers while playing and a great in depth gaming experience from choosing and making tactics for set pieces individual sideline orders in game contract renewals contracts talks team meetings and talks and even individual promises if players believe they are not getting enough game time or believe they need rewarding with a new contract a must play game for any simulator and football genre fan
recommended
not the best verion of fm but certainly not the worst yes there are bugs and irritations but still playable
recommended
great d
recommended
thoroughly enjoyable and easy to get stuck into great game for me
recommended
waited til christmas to get it cheaper dont see what the fuss is about the game works fine and the ui is more intuitive i played cm through to fm for over 10 years although ive been skipping a few since it became fm all those who complained about injuries and letting it soft goals are just not playing it right i managed to clear all injuries several times to a point where my backuprotational players were complaining that they werent playing enough games as for gameplay i havent experienced any atrocious situations that a lot of reviews described set your tactics and preparations right get good coaches manage your players motivation and ration your training you shouldnt encounter silly problems
recommended
if people are terrible at this game they shouldnt be allowed to write reviews for it which is what 90% of the negative reviews seem to be great game so immersive and a real challenge when starting at the lower leagues 1010
recommended
its like fifa but take away you controlling the players and you actually have to think on how to win games 1010
recommended
great new features too add to the classic fm game
recommended
better than previous editions enjoy
recommended
most indepth manager game i bought this game reading all the bad reviews and not expecting much but it really is an improvement if you love managing your team then this game is for you 
recommended
excellent game i have far too much time playing this it is just that addicting
recommended
if youre into this football then this is the game for you but look for it at a discount as its quite pricey otherwise one of the best games ive played in a while

recommended
stick to fm2014
not recommended
i would 100% recormend this game to anyone that likes gamemodes like career mode on fifa 15 but football manager goes into fare more depth and more teams and player even though the graphic arnt great the game makes it back with many fetures that they offer this year it is made easyer to navigate the menu the best new feature is when setting up a new carear you change your past history from a no body to a exworld class player
recommended
people should learn the game before crying about it if the way you used to do things dont work maybe its time to do it differently instead of crying about it i like it im happy with it new scouting system is awesome
recommended
really not enjoying it so far way too many injuries my players went on international breaks and at least 8 of them came back injured and some of the ratings seem pretty ridiculous to me nemanja matic is rated the same if not lower as john obi mikel
not recommended
i have to disagree with the majority of reviews i have played the franchise for years also and i am loving this edition may be it is because i have just brought it and it has been updated but everything including the match engine have been drastically improved the injurys are nothing out of the ordanary and i am playing with arsenal goals per game are very realistic and i have had only 2 big wins out of 10 games yet i have lost only 1 friendly and the charity sheild against city which ended 20 what ever the other reviews said negitivly about this game i have seen none of so far and to think i almost took note of what people where saying and almost never brought it and i am so glad i did cdkeys sold it for 2091 and it was well worth it already didnt think i liked the dark skin and i was disappointed that it was the only one but after trying a few of the custom light skins i soon went back and love the original dark skin now my one critic so far is the pitchs look slighly blocky and not smooth enough
recommended
brilliant
recommended
ive only put in about 20 hours not much considering its the fm series in the beta so far but i just feel that i have to counter these complaints about the game engine being worse for the first time since fm09 i feel that the game engine has improved from last year im not experiencing these random results at all and the goals that are scored are can almost everytime be traced to a tactical flaw or strength as opposed to fm14 where that percentage wouldve been about 50 im not experiencing this whole thing with vast amounts of goals being scoredconceded either nor the comeback issue people have been reporting i feel like these issues sound like typical beta issues remember it is a beta youve been playing that will be resolved quickly but will see either way im good corners have been improved where tactics and player attributes actually make a difference for once and it is now finally possible to score on free kicks and longshots again it was of course possible before  but not even the best players in the world would even be close to a realistically decent conversion rate
recommended
quite a few glitches but thats because im playing the alpha version looks like its going to be another succesful instalment to the series
recommended
awesome game as always football manager 15 is the best fm so far  keep it up d any old fm fan should get this 
recommended
this game is more loading screen than game
not recommended
this game deserves the nobel prize well it should deserves a big awards of some sort the main reason is because of its compelling nature no one will be able to hop off the fm15 train once they have set foot in as a big football fan it is an honour that i get to play and experience one of the most intricated and dedicated football simulation ever so please if you are ever wondering what to do on a wet and stormy tuesday night the best solution is to immerse yourself into what is known as fm15
recommended
this game has single handedly ruined my life i love it
recommended
love football manager since the cm series too bad i can not use my steam wallet for in game purchase this time keep give me error code 1
recommended
can anyone tell me how play on ipad ive downloaded the game to pc but want it on ipad aswelinstead
recommended
fairly simple to game to play my son loves it
recommended
the game is fine when you can get on it i got the bata code whick keeps crashing and now ive got the disk wont let me play it saying i need to buy the game which is in its steam thats  every year get nothing but  take my money then  me around really not happy and dont think im guna ever buy this game again
recommended
yes i do recommned this game yes it needs a lot of work and got back to the old style as not big fan of the side bar it is a pain to buy players offered arsenal 150m for gibbs and they said know im like whaaattttttt apprently its not a good offer dw i wasnt gonna spend that much i was just annoyed because 36mil wasnt good enough so pretty much taking the  match engine is fast but very poor at same time its they just improve what they got and stop adding new fetures in an till its compleatly right i think si will go down if they dont make it bettter
recommended
why is every single injury in this game for me a sports hernia out for 45 weeks i am 4 seasons in on a save and in the bpl and i have had no injurys that lasted for more than 3 months but at any given time my goalkeeper and at least 2 of my first team players are out with a sports hernia other than that good game
recommended
this game is just amazing  if you fan of football then buy this you will like this  
recommended
its good everyone complaining that its the same game thats the case every year i dont know why some people want or expect an entirely different game personally i would be upset if they drastically changed things pros new and improved graphics and animations requires real tactical planning simply throwing top players out there without careful strategic planning will result in losses improved more streamlined interface except for the tactics screen for some reason they made it worse and you have to click more stuff improved scouting and player potential system improved training options its m f ing football manager cons tactics screen is worse now some early bugs will be fixed in the coming months most likely too many goals are scored from set pieces some wonky things with the match engine players kick balls directly in to players in front of them way too often and the ball will pingpong off of players randomly too much in the box
recommended
minor change but still fun so many bad review its $30 what do you expect guys

really vague no tutorial or anything i was expecting it to be more interactive and user friendly i had been playing nba 2k15 a lot and expected it to be similar where you could actually control a player but it seemed like it just skipped over everything
not recommended
dont buy it you will get addicted

when i come to a spesific dato i automatically are throw to steam meny doesnt help if i go on vacation either does anyone know how to fix this dave
recommended
it is now much easier to score goal good chance in player mood swing otherwise pretty much the same as previous installment
recommended
i have absolutely no regret for buying this game although it is quite difficult to start with for some people it takes considerable time to delve deeply enough into this game before you can get the hang of it but the rewards are far more than you can expect as for me i totally love this game and i would encourage every football fan to try it and give it a fair shot you wont be disappointed in most cases
recommended
ignore what everyone else is saying this is a great game which i enjoy it very much it is great
recommended
latest release of football manager have to say have really been enjoying it well adapted to let you to control as much or as little of the team as required new developments such as having areas that you are a appraised on as a manager are minor tweaks to the game on the surface but all put together they make some major changes also the game play when watching seems more realistic and believable than previous versions
recommended
a lot more fun than the last one
recommended
early cross is very easy to score just fix it

recommended
very good game tbh but such a complex tactics still using other tactics than my own heheh
recommended
im everton fc i have bought the game expecting it to be better than last year the most fustrating parts about last years game was the poor quality of crossing and almost no through balls behind the defence from the midfield to striker this year the crossing has improved a lot and works well however this is the only way i can score and it is getting boring ive tried pump ball into box which only affects the defenders and makes them hoof it this game just cant seem to make through passes for the striker dissapointing

this game is amazing and i know for a fact i am never going to play any other game for a long long time ui the new ui is great even though it comes down to personal preference many people dont like the new sidebar but i persoanlly think its pretty good the whole ui is also a lot cleaner ai the ai is pretty realistic even though clubs sometimes make unrealistic demands of players while they could just say that they arent interested in selling the player other then that i dont really have any problems with this also some people dont like the scouting of players but this is just meant to be realistic you are always free to play football manager classic which doesnt include a lot of the time consuming features such as team talks and continuous scouting match engine when people say the match engine is horrible they do have a point horrible horrible goalkeepers defenders not knowing how to defend strikers dribbling right through defenders and these are only a few of the bad stuff this normally wouldnt be a problem but the match result is determined by the match engine as the game continues so goalkeepers make stupid mistakes like not responding quick enough and so you lose because of that this for me is pretty much the only bad thing about fm15 even though this is like one of the most important parts multiplayer now i dont think anyone else thinks this but i think fms multiplayer is horrible the season goes on without you when some people are on and its just messed up and complicated i havent played multiplayer much but this is just my experience from multiplayer conclusion this is a great game i dont know if people who are already fans of the series need to buy this one but people just starting with the series should definitely get this i really hope this helped
recommended
the graphics is great it more realistic than fm 2014 the engine is great a lot of cool stuff and great look but it still like older fm and not quite change a lot there are still bugs the most thing that make me hated is the shots in a match my team scored 18 but 9 on target and 3 goals when they shot 10 6 on target and 5 goal and the second thing is injury why is injury happened a lot and crazy like 67 months 35 months 67 weeks but this game is still cool i really like this game if you like football and like manage football club i recommend you to play this for me this game is 7510
recommended
day 3 i am sitting here with my curtains closed my eyes is bloodstrained i begin to channel my inner rage after that throughball miss i shout out in the room dammit suarez and bang my fist in the table so my cola spills all over the table this game is 1010 really this game will consume your time you might aswell say goodbye to the world as you know it you wont be seeing your loved ones in a looooong time
recommended
what is going on i started 2 new games and in both stoke are unbeatable now correct me if im wrong but there not a top 6 club never mind top 3  and what can i say about the defending it is a disgrace my central defenders are probably top goalscorers with all the own goals and top of the asists would be my keeper all in all a great game but still needs alot of work and theres only 4 days tto go  sort it out si
recommended
this was the first fm that i bought but im really happy that i did it its an amazing game i love this franchise and i hope the 16 would be even better
recommended
so frustating i dont know whats wrong i feel like i lost my ability to play this game i am noob all over again been playing since 2001  my team keep shooting didnt score the enemy 1 bullet to the heart and of course i lost the game  my wing back keep dribbling until byline wont cross and if he do the crosses hit enemy foot and goes corner kick frustating  my goalie is dumb enemies goalie is all neuer unbeatable i need or we all need major fixes please

generally its a good game but there is way too many unrealistic results in the game for an example i played a game where i was man utd against spurs and i won it 107 i also think that there is scoring way too many goals by crosses and rebound goals but i also think that they have improved the game there is a lot more features in football manager 15 for an example i think that it is great that i can see my own manager skills and i also think that the jobinterviews has gotten a lot better and more realistic but there is still too many unrealistic things in the match simulator that i really hope they will improve from a scale from 110 ill give it 6 
recommended
excellent as per there are small bugs to fix and changes to be made but there always are at this stage of release i always find the finished article is when they release the large update after the january transfer window regardless definitely worth a purchase
recommended
ive put the beta version on my laptop but now ive purchased the actual game on disc but after i install the game it still says this is the beta version on the bottom left of screen  so does this mean my disc hasnt installed or how do i play the disc version
recommended
contrary to a lot of view i recommend fm15 although i am new to the game itself i am an avid football fan so here a quick whats good and whats bad in my opinion please remember im new to fm and will say what i like from my point of view regardless of whether it has been in the fm franchise in the past or if it was better on old versions whats good modern menu system which is easy to navigate lot of reposibilites which make gameplay feel realistic ability to assign assistant manager to roles like dealing with training etc in game graphics are exceptable however dont accept fifa or pes standard games have felt realistic and in game tactics make a massive difference whats bad  i really could not get to grips with the scouting system on both of my two careers so far i have created a scouting assignment in which no players have been scouted or suggested to me nothing at all maybe im the one at fault but that is not my fault as the game didnt explain it properly to me i have yet to make a single signing yet due to not being able to find an adequate player who meets my scout report  i have started 2 careers and in both the same transfers were happening southampton bought jo from cam and naughton from tottenham and also sold clyne to spurs in both careers as well as man u buying vertonghen and khedira going to chelsea i found it annoying because i wanted to see a variation and to be interested in the other signings rather than seeing the same deals happen this maybe like something i havent downloaded or something not sure tbh i expected players to have faces and also the top division clubs from the bpl to have the official badges but they dont overall i would recommend this game because of the potential of reach 3 digits of game time i will always continue to play this game and am definitely happy to have bought it
recommended
ive played most the football managers over the years and to be fair this is a big step up from fm14 which was awful i have actually got into this fm and enjoyed every minute of it i like the new press and scouting features and can see a difference with the game engine even if its small for everybody saying its awful just remeber its still a new release and comparing with last year its pretty descent i havent had the trouble of to many goals from crosses to me this game is enjoyable and fun
recommended
best football manager so far

much better than 2014 simple lay out and good fun a must buy

the worst fm ever half of my team is injured and the graphics are sooooo bad i wish i could ask for a refund 100% waste of money
recommended
i started a season with man utd and i have constantly been picking up injuries ive not once had anywhere near a full strength team and falcao even got injured for 6 months it seems im picking up two injuries a game other than that the game is very good the scouting in particular has been greatly improved on previous versions of fm it almost seemed too easy to find amazing players and judge who was going to be the next big thing now a lot less players appear when searching for transfers meaning youll have to send your scouts out to other leagues and teams to gather information theyve also added the option to scout an individual player for serveral months with more indepth scouting reports if youre already big into fm and have played previous versions i think its a big enough update from 14 to be worth purchasing and for those whove never played it the way that si have arranged their tabs and generally neatened up and simplified the layout of the game makes fm 15 the most accesible for a while
recommended
cant launch this game its alway crash

wtf is this  you play as a coachmanager of a soccer team obviously this game isnt geared towards an american audience its basically a spreadsheet simulator that goes into great detail you get to watch games yell at refs and give your team a peptalk theres like 3040 different options on how to give the peptalk too if you ever wanted to work as a coachmanager this game is great i thought it was boring as  the game is as advertised though and quite thorough in its approach

im managers fan since world soccer on atari 65xe and i have solid history with all cmfm series releases with all that i can assure you this version of fm is another milestone  somehow like fm 2008 was  at the start of betaearly access the game was a bit buggy and match engine needed a lot of tweeks but yet another time si and their team step up to the challenge and actualy listen to the community in last 14 days they hotfixed most of the issues and game is very enjoyable surely the most realistc one to date cant wait for todays release to play with my friend on multiplayer if you are series fan you cant miss it match engine is fun to watch game is pretty challenging and once again you can feel almost like a harry redknap or sam alardyce standing next to the touchline my score is 92100  if multiplayer will turn out to be bugfree then its 99100 cheers

this is for the beta only not played on the full game yet typical fm beta the match gameplay is wild not other way to explain it same moves over and over again no passing only long balls up top like watching west ham last season and to wrap it all up ridiculousout of this world results ie i beat man city with chelsea 71 then i loose to stoke 50 they played the same formation not saying it couldnt happen but come on really like the added feature of being able to persuade a player to talk to you about a transfercontracts when there not interested and also the player compatancy ratings and also like the side bar style menu yes i know you could change the settings in fm14 hope the full game sorts the match gameplay time will tell if ive wasted 30 p

football manager 2015 is good improvement over its last version visual improvements are particularly very good game engine has improved which is expected new interface is very useful once you get accostom to it another thing that is improved is player interaction players are more and more interactive about transfer related issues like selling young player or if player wants to leave he make whole dressing room unhappy all in all they have improved the game but i was expecting more from fm on commentarytraining improvements this time so bit disappointed in that sense all in all latest fm version is always better than last one
recommended
i play the beta version one week now and i am really excited to play the full version soonfrom 199798 i play championship manager as it was called back on dayevery year i buy this game every single year and i can tell that game improve a lot but the last few years no major changes in match engine and the truth is that i didnt found any difference from these last few years and i was little disapointedbtw fm live was awesomeirelevant this year match engine is great you can actually make your tactics work and so far i dont see any weakness in game playopponents match smarter and most important you can make your dream tactics work without having in mind that because match engine is weak cant support certain ways of game styleonly one thing i ask for next fm to comeadd training development that you can actually work in certain game plays during the game like way your players want to move and combinationsthat would be the ultimate manager game evercheers

so i really hated this game at the beginning when it was a beta there were many errors was less realistic than the fm14 goals would be scored easily for or against you players mentality was very bad and weak that there were 4 goal comebacks everywhere however after they fixed all that the game is awesome now like always its amazing a realistic life experience for your dream job with the new feature now you feel more in control of your team how you communicate with your players and media and of course the new amazing feature of setting your style of coaching and what kind of a football manager you are which i find just brilliant and the studying for licenses as well i could go on and on for days but i wont because there is a new season about to start so get this game put on your suit and get busy

still astonishingly addictive and now the match enigne performed reasonably and as expected update i would recommend this game at the current state yeay the match engine is more polished and work as intended the ai of long shooter minded has been reduced thank you sports interactive good job what i wrote on 15 nov however the match engine is a real culprit how come i can play tikitaka feet to feet football in this fm 2015 iteration would like to recommend this game if the match engine and the artificial halfintelligence is upgraded into proper ai 1forcing me to use crossing and old kick n rush strategy to win the game which means my full back either left or right have create minimum 4 assist up until quaterhalf of the season i do love winning a game but obviously by playing beautiful football like arsenal real madrid barcelona and bayern did not a kick n rush oldish football 2 when my striker or inside forward is moving to channel rather than he passes to the team mates who has better chance to score he fires the ball and you know way above the woodwork simply dumb even when i set to shoot less often it is still often occur move into channel > shoot rather than pass > bye not a single goal my arsenal usualy have 2030 shots per game with only 58 on goal and rate of conversion below 10% 3fm 2013 match engine is better than 2015 simply said

update has been added below  november 24 2014 stay away from the game many issues which were solved years ago have come back  too many goals from corners  too many goals from crosses  way too many injuries my last game 1yellowred card and 3 serious injuries one ing game  stupid mistakes from goalkeepers yes the passing issue is still there  very bad user interface in the tactic area it was much better in fm 2014  same tranfer ai issues we saw within fm 2006 or 2007 ai is buying players for too much money ai teams demand too much money for young talents 3040 mio  instant goals from the oppostions dominate the game score a goal and watch how yout opponent scores 20 seconds later  leading 2  0 often leads to a sudden rush of the opponent which results in a 2  3 good things new scouting area is an improvement i like the bar on the left but this has already been in the game years ago it was removed now it is back i made this experiences with a team playing against relegation in the first geman league maybe the fm feels better if you play with a team like barcelona in total not worth the money for me it feels like they published a reskinnend version of fm2006 better wait for some patches and watch the community  update 02122014 si has released 2 updates from what i experience now the game has improved and im currently enjoying it big improvement  stupid mistakes from goalkeepers yes the passing issue is still there have not seen this any more big improvement  leading 2  0 often leads to a sudden rush of the opponent which results in a 2  3 the rush is still present but normally the ai will score ones and then youll be able to make it 31 or maybe 32 big improvement  too many goals from crosses in my opinion the amount of goals after crosses has come to a normal level but i have also worked on my tactic improved  too many goals from corners its has been improved but i still seem to concede many goals after corners this could also be an issue of my tactic slightly improved  very bad user interface in the tactic area it was much better in fm 2014 player roles are back on the tactic screen but still a bit complicated no change  way too many injuries i still got many injuries sometimes it is very annoying but the good thing is that most of the injuries are not serious it seems like there is a higher chance to get serious injuries during the season breaks within the season i am often faced with injuries during matches but so are normally only minor things max 34 weeks could be balanced a bit no change  same tranfer ai issues we saw within fm 2006 or 2007 ai is buying players for too much money ai teams demand too much money for young talents 3040 mio ai is releasing too many players for free this is my biggest complain with the game the transferai is still stupid apart from the huge amount of money the top aiteams are spending you will also be able to find very good player for free for example bayern is releasing xherdan shaqiri for free in real life they are demanding 25 million euro this means that you will be able to upgrade your team from a mid class club to a european topteam wihtin a couple of seasons way too easy this was already an issue of previous fm games conclusion i have improved my tactic to handle the match engine issues after the updates i was able to set my wing backs from defend to support duties without getting rushed by the ai good thing because you dont feel so helpless anymore and this gives you the opportunity to try more things thank god that the issue with leads of 2  0 is gone that was very annoying overall i have started enjoying the fm scouting is really fun now and makes more sence the transfer ai should be improved with the next updates same procedure as every yearbut im sure the issue with too many good free player will not be solved also likey every other year in fm history so i can now recommend the gamebut never preorder it

 below is my original review but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended because even after patching the game and matchengine is unrealistic how could the programmers not realise this i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14 this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say though it does have its problems id definitely recommend this to fans of the series lets go through the pros and cons pros  i like the new ui i think its improved on previous titles with things like scoutingtransfers in more logical places  it runs smoother you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match instead it takes less than 2 seconds this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time  i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons  weirdly takes longer to save than fm14 over a minute and a half for me  the games are too high scoring and this needs to be patched for realism purposes i just had 5 games that were 63 63 53 00 lol and 63 again a bit silly  goalkeepers are pretty bad hence the high scores  it feels like its harder to play a possession game but that might be just because im leicester its a fun game im definitely glad i bought it good for fans of the series if patched it could be brilliant they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in but they dont seem to have

before buying it i heard people saying it was a bad game and i could better buy fm14 but i didnt listen to them and bought fm15 thank god i didnt listen the game is very good graphics gameplay everything sometimes the injuries and big losses can make you angry but i learned after years of playing fm10 that you just have to go on even when its not going well with your club and manager career first seasons i ended 5th with feyenoord rotterdam not very well as i say it myself still won the national cup second and third season i did the right job and became champions two times also winning the cup again was very nice to make a summary of it keep playing even when its not going well and enjoy the game its very good

updated after the big patch original review my first and only game review i was that  off is below i was negative ill hold my hands up now though and admit that while still not perfect the game is playable seems to be fair better balanced and without most of the big game breaking faults ive done about 8 seasons now mostly offline so forgive the lack of played hours its a decent game its not the best i still prefer fm12 and cm0102 in terms of hours played but its matured to be a decent entry cheers devs cheers tactical genius people for the mutley tweak formation cheers to you for reading i recommend the game original review im a big fan of fm games been playing since 0102 and have enjoyed many hundreds of hours of game time ive been playing fm2015 since release mostly offline i have a lot more hours than probably shown and i have more than one account this is the first time ive ever reviewed a game im doing so because its just so broken i feel i have to for every person saying the game is broken theres another saying its because of bad tactics etc well for me its just a rage inducing festival of disappointment yes theres going to be bugs yes theres going to be the odd quirk but when you reload a save and replay the same fixture a dozen times using different squads and tactics and still concede an own goal in the 90th minute after conceding an 85th minute wonder strike something is up nothing i do seems to make a difference to the evidently preplanned scoreline you could edit in the best players in the world and theyd still lose 21 to sheffield flippin wednesday everytime on my save i can live with the slightly mad bits of the game players demanding to leave then moaning when theyre transfer listed or your only expensive purchase always getting a long term injury in first half of his second match for example but when you get the impression that youre merely following a preordained set of results theres kind of no point its a terrible shame and although i expect itll all be fixed eventually its the one game i feel absolutely cheated by 30 can get you a fair bit in the steam store do think very carefully before spending it on a game that actually makes you for the first time ever angry at playing if you find otherwise if you find it to be brilliant good on you i know the developers are active in the forums trying to sort stuff out which deserves some credit but theyve got their work cut out of that much i am certain

first match ribery gets injured the rest of the players are on vacation so i cant play the next match because i only have 10 players restart first match ribery gets injured this game will improve or people will not buy fm 16 update march 2015 a key first team player was sold without my approval before i played the first training match update a key first team player was sent on  permanent holiday without my approval should in real life be fairly easy to buy the entire norwegian national team with real madrids budget in this game you cant even buy norways 3 best players combined but its not all bad some of the data collected on players are fair the layouts of representation possible player qualities are ok in real life grorud would never fill a stadium and they would near holding draw vs rbk tippeligaen and 1 division may be equal in skill but lower level teams suck hard the player helland must have been coded wrong in this game instead of dribbleing and shooting at the goal this game depicts him as a total not intelligent at all person number of injuries for my team does not feel realistic 3 critical injuries just before and iin first training match is far too many in real life the player malec is a huge player 2 meter and one would notice him as much taller than the rest of the players on the football pitch the stadium at kristiansund is possibly corretly filled with people but the stadion i real life would be silent

its that time of year again where sports interactive release their next installment to the football manager series and without question it is the best one yet theyve completely overhauled the ui to make it much more simplistic when nagivating and searching for vital information about your squad and club one of the biggest features to football manager 2015 is the tracksuit & suit manager this adds a roleplaying element to the game which allows you to choose your stats this will affect your team mentally and physically depending on which of the two you prefer or perhaps you want to be a mixture of both which is fine as well as minor improvements to media tactics etc theyve also improved the 3d match engine to make it more realistic with over two thousand new animations using reallife player movement capture technology it now feels like youre closer to the reallife game more than ever my verdict is this game is fantastic and if you love past football manager games im sure youll really enjoy your time with this one
recommended
i have a total of  500 hours in football manager 2013 and 2014 and thus i consider myself a fan of the series unfortunately tho fm 2015 is a big step back personally i miss the sliders and tweakings you could do in fm2013 but that is just my opinion what is not just an opinion is the horrible match engine there is basically two options which each have their different negatives 2d engine your team will score and conceed like  its totally normal that a game between bvb and bayern munich would end up 47 or something crazy like that 3d engine players are just stupid as f almost every tackle is a sliding tackle people will just consider hey lets not pick up that ball that is only 5 metres away from me because my mate that is 30 metres away is already going for it overall the ai in 3d mode is just rubbish goalkeepers do not know how to get out of the box even when they are set to sweeper keeper attack if they somehow get out on occasion tho they will just do stupid runs for the ball near the corner flag which result in very easy long shot goals for the opposition sorry si but you failed hope there is a patch some day i will certainly not be buying fm 2016 if anything stays like that
not recommended
i enjoyed playing this game only with a friend as it introduced a competative side to be the most succesful manager the game has improved alot over the years but the 3d animations on the pitch still looks like garbage players skate around the pitch goalies make poor attempts to save the ball and overall it just looks horrible im still keeping my fingers crossed for a football manager game that has a great looking 3d match view
not recommended
ive only been playing fm since 2012 and the main issue for me is the match engine i bought fm14 and that was horrible the match engine was stupid because the players would dance around everywhere and your defence had no chance you could buy the best players and they still would struggle i had my doubts about buying fm15 after that but when i seen it on sale i though i would give it ago and i found it much better alot has improved there is still some work to do on the match engine it is now more realistic i guess but still stumble around abit but its better than ive seen it before the defence seems much better its hard to get around depending on the strengh on your defence so i was happy with that as for the interface in game i was happy with that also its now much easier to get around and you have all information on your homescreen im hoping they have took steps forward for their next game fm16 and i will buy it because they seem to be going in the right direction at least for the newcomers you will really enjoy this game if you like the idea of managing your team hiring staff negotiating contracts pushing your team to the top it will give you hours of endless fun for the regulars well you know how it is you can lose track of the time when you sit on this game but it has improved from the last game so that is something and i would reccomend buying it even if you had a bad experience with the last 1 like me its worth it although my main motivation for buying it was the sale price i dont think i would of bought it at full price as fm16 is not far away good game overall

still world leading soccerfootballmanager game out there however in my opinion the lack of competition in this market makes the fm crew more lazy and instead of evolving the game adding features and so on they choose to make it more user friendly for each year mainstreaming it as much as possible to get more people in to it i havent read other reviews but for me fm 2014 was bigger and better more integration with players and other managers still a great game tho with the game engine getting tho marginally better each year i guess whats annoy me is that they most likely allready have the features for fm 2018 but are saving them until they have to make bigger changes cause of competition

i finally gave in and gave this years well last years version a go thinking the problems couldnt be as bad as everyone says 7 matches in and im ready to delete the game and give up completely on the series which is a complete shadow of what it used to be 7th match of the season 4 injuries in 1 match all 3 of my strikers out injured afterwards 2 for 56 weeks and 1 for 34 months im a part time team who cant afford to buy anything and now my save is basically ruined because injury manager 2015 said screw you from the reviews this will happen time and time again si you used to be great i could throw hundreds of hours each year at every new version but somehow for the last 34 years youve made the match engine less realistic and less enjoyable to play and you seemingly have no interest in rsolving any of the issues because youre working on flashy new additions to the next game which amoutns down to dumbing it down even more making the match engine even more unrealistic but adding in more useless media interaction that does nothing to your gameplay

well there i was looking to enjoy the nexr edition off fm oh dear who on earth made this one must be someone that has never seen a game of football in their life  1 goalkeepers from other teams play like gordan banks my goalkeeper is making all kinds of blunders 2 i agree some games even if you have 70 percent possession you can still lose to a counter attack however not every game there is too many times that you have 40 shots with no goal and the other team have 1 shot 1 goal  highlights still look like we have a graphics engine from the days of manic miner  i went to buy a player at man united and asked the board they said that they agree however cant afford lol really also some teams are way overated like liverpool and others programmer must have a liverpool shirt on steven im dead gerrard beat walcott in a race for the ball wtf

completely worth the money i have spent on it when the preorder became available i brought it since the beta i have had many saves for many people football manager isnt just a game but a way of life i started in the beta as watford manager my favourite club i played this save through the beta and in this time won the triple the prem fa cup and capital one then i moved on to a journey man save my manager had sunday league experience with no coaching badges and over the 15 year period i managed 7 clubs in 6 different leagues winning 7 pieces of silver ware then i am currently playing as stevenage manager with the aim to make the club selfsufficient with currently being in 2026 and one every competition i have been in in the last 4 years would be 5 but thanks to arsenal i lost the fa cup moving onto the game going from fm14 where i have over 760 hours the ui was very different seeing the task bar moving from the top to the side was very weird but unlike first thought takes up less room as well as makes tasks easier personally i dont use skins but with the community out there finding a perfect skin is easy with badges and kits i always mod the game in this particular side although when i first loaded the game i was happy to see nearly every league had the kits and badges except for germany and the english premier league due to licenses the match engine is extremely better than the previous years and this makes the game so much better with the fm community the badges kits and more is available to combat the license issues with finding regens and making them world class you can easily create bonds with the players overall i have over 1150 hours playing this beautiful game and i have extremely enjoyed the game and will continue to enjoy fm15 for many of the players they will agree football manager is a way of life this game is completely worth its price from regen hunting where you look for good young players to develop to just straight up winning games if you love football this game is for you

just like the rest of the fms they just keep getting a tad better each year only thing is for a yearly update and just a mild upgrade im not sure why it costs so much after all these years of cm and fm i might finally start doing an everyother year purchase just so im a bit more impressed and not spending so much on mild upgrades
