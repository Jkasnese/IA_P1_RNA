counter strike global offensive counterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play it everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play csgo 1 pfft im never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys thats stupid 2 im never going to get that angry its only a game 3 meh doesnt look that hard within a month  within a week  1 youve already have bought a p90 module skin because oh its only 30p and you begin your slow downward spiral into the csgo marketplace saving up for a knife and opening crates in hopes of getting a knife which deep on the inside deep deep down you know youre never going to get and end up spending 10 opening crates and getting back 50p worth of skins back 2 youve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives its a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity 3 youll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game but you cant youll always go back the community is utterly merciless and beastly with over half the people being angry 12 year old russians the betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins and the trading is completely unreliable leaving you to deal with steam support which is 10x more brutal than the game itself but of course youll go back its csgo its a drug a soul destroying mind numbing murder spree inducing drug

ive played csgo for a thousand hours plus i think ive clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughtsinsightsfeedback of the game if there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game it would be for two reasons firstly i have to say that the csgo community is horrible people show no signs of mercy to those who are new including myself at times there are plenty of rude people of course ive met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob  not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they dieddidnt get a killfor fun secondly the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now these people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual fps and also in competitive mode especially for smurfs i know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them and as for hackers there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services these people are simply a real pain to the csgo community need i say more csgo honestly is good fun i do love csgo i have spent many good hours with friends meeting new people and killing chickens however the harsh reality of the csgo is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that youre no good along with a good bunch of hackerssmurfs who ruins your gaming experience if you cant handle the harshness of the csgo community dont start playing it however if you choose to enter the csgo world alone good luck i hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades until valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs especially in competitive mode i will not recommend it suggestion to counter smurfs if the ip address has been in a csgo server before heshe will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode edit valves implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins additional note to the few who have disagreed with my review because its the community youre unhappy about not the game heres what i have to say i strongly believe for a game like csgo in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not it is the community that makes the game whole and who it is especially for a game like csgo i highly doubt people buy csgo to play offline modebot matches though i understand your point of view and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanismsfuntionalities like movementgun bullet mechanicsmatchmaking however for my review my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surfacetrailers at first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all however once you get into the game i believe youll change your opinion if you still disagree i think its either you havent been exposed enough or youre just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches @shadowdance youre welcome you gave me the push to write this reply cheers fellow comrades

the review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings notice i have 3k hours i have been playing counterstrike since 15 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the grand theft auto series or the battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love if you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that cs has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there unlike games like call of duty or battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times yes it happens but to be good in counterstrike global offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective this is the ultimate teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them i stayed up all night til 7am to watch either dreamhack or esl forget which one that one match alone had about 300000 viewers whereas cs source was barely keeping their head above water with professional tournys and teams in their day so whats the problem the up until just recently awesome people over at valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins cases keys taxes on items we sell on the marketplace passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15 i dont think you will find a single player in cs that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even equal to cs and its replayability for $15 that being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking ie wallhackingaimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 499 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem now you think about valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be many people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game just to hack and boost their friends this is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me i literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians i am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in csgo everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on always be a new account on the other team what is their excuse oh im just smurfing you can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not 612 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins nowadays 910 overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or 20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt possibly be hacking hackers do this because they know there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever valve states that anyone vacbanned will not be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever so tell me why during one of the major cs go tournaments that just passed pasha from the pro team virtus pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match simply said no i am not hacking and got his account unbanned if he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right wrong it is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshopnot exactly certain on the details even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away the major point i am trying to make on this subject is that valve makes millions on us for each skin key case tax on the items we sell in game operation pass and copy of the game we buy and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system thats like the nfl making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught if you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 123 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being smurfing smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have fun its pathetic and lowers counterstrike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on pc we must not forget it did pave the way for games like cod valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game if that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would not recommend counterstrike again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to cs its not something i can easily do valve knows this and valve is taking advantage of us end of story

dear counterstrike players after a long period playing this game 1000h i think i have the advantage to write a better review than my last first i want to say thank you valve for making a nice game like counterstrike global offensive but there are some things valve has to change really fast 1 cheating there are more and more cheaters every fu day the vacsystem isnt as save as it should be i hope valve is working on it 2 ddosing i think the valveservers should be very save but then there is the ddosing how is it able to get the ips from your opponents this fast and ddos them please fix the serversecure 3 smurfing through all those steamsales you get more and more smurfs highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it i think they should make an ipbased system where the rank is linked to the ip or something like this 4 patches patch after patch the game is getting worse they nerf every weapon till the weapon isnt playable anymore with the maps you have the same problem 5 serverproblems also steamserver steam and valve arent able to fix their serverproblems so the game isnt playable because of laggs and disconnects also the cooldown you can get is very unfair this is fu s 6 community the community isnt as good as i hoped most of the people are pretty unfriendly over all counterstrike isnt playable anymore and the higher the rank the more hackers you get please fix the things i listed above and make the game playable again and i know that valve cant fix the community but i hope the community will get better ps im from germany so there are maybe some spelling mistakes

counterstrike global offensive is a brilliant game there is no doubt about it defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today however a game should be played purely for the sake of fun counterstrike global offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun but whether or not you actually manage to get any fun out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state simply put counterstrike global offensive is a modernised version of the counterstrike everybody knows and loves only this time it has a ranking system and balanced matchmaking so that you always get a fair game regardless of your skills  sounds awesome right too bad that at the moment matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair  i will elaborate but first i just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic i am not here to dispute that fact but rather that a game that relies heavily on its community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game see the people that dishout endless tutorials and tips such as warowl & 3kliksphillip for example 9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating lets not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anticheat measures are making very little difference especially when some of the most proffessional and famous counterstrike global offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had vac bans in the past and while that doesnt necessarily mean they are still cheating it is not out of the bounds of possibility another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that arent hormonal teenagers or prepubescent children that do nothing but give out grief racial and or homophobic slurs then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team but hey if you play this game with the right people it is still a great experience whether you win or lose i have met some great people in my time playing unfortunately these great people are outnumbered by the bad ones at least that was my experience i still believe that the good outweighs the bad just ignore the idiots if you can even though it will be hard if they resort to teamkilling and intentional friendly fire i guarantee youll be using the block communication feature a lot  i know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isnt very good or just new to the game altogether but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else instead of kicking and griefing them try helping them instead everybody was new to counterstrike at some point in time remember that so until valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game i cant really recommend it regardless of how much i like the game itself its situations like this that make me wish steams review system had a mixed option cause it really does pain me to click no for a game that is fun and competetive counterstrike global offensive is one to buy but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking if youre having a lucky day you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go but lets just say the odds arent exactly in your favor if one day the matchmaking has vastly improved then i will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves but until then im afraid i cant by the way to be genuinely good at counterstrike global offensive  you must own at least one expensive weapon skin or better yet a $300 virtual knife they seem to be the major factor in judging ones skills these days the short version amazing game but ruined by its community

they say that its easier to tear someone down than it is to build someone up its true its ing true how no one does anything about it they go with it and call you a  or ing garbage and so on no one cares about the kid who just sits there doing nothing wrong and gets called that no one cares about the one who isnt as good as the rest and sits in spawn while his team constantly calls him gay and a  head and constantly pointing every single thing that hes done wrong no one bothers to give lending advice or compliment what good hes done they just tear down the foundation of him they dont bother mending to the walls of the household theyd rather fire the cannons at it they would rather choke you with aspersion than give just one compliment the world would much rather lead the child to end of his short life and throw away all his progress and the [wonderful] things he would accomplish later on in life the world is sick to me i just wish people would cast aside the brutes club and wield the carpenters hammer the game itself is good however the community sucks

i want to like this game i really do but theres just a few quirks i cant get past nothing about gameplay or anything like that for whatever reason i dont feel like coming home and playing csgo for hours as i do with other games also the community is really mean to new players for some odd reason my first competetive game i had people calling me a  just because wasnt going to the right place when im the last alive and i lose a gunfight i get kicked for nothing in particular and when im playing with my friends and i dont understand how i havent hit the person my friends tell me dont question it and if you learned how to play you wouldnt get killed all the time the problem is how do you learn how to play when nobody is nice enough to help you out ps there are occasionally the nice ones in a lobby but they are not the majority edit i did play some deathmatch and i thought i did pretty well even some of my friends who are vets said that i should start playing competetive

first off im not sure when trolls smurfs and hacks began to become the norm but the game is broken they put it on sale for 500 kids buy it just to hack it valve knows they dont care and all we do is buy buy buy skins i mean 40000 for a knife skin wtf didnt we used to be able to get those for free the guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly hacking is big business they took 12 name tags from me all because of 1 offcolor gun name meanwhile vulgarity far worse than my gun name is allowed to cheat troll and make the game unplayable because its funny to watch people get  and valve does nothing but put the game on sale and kids rememer when you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 6500  35 or 50 for the season pass you set what the market will bear thus making games more expensive for us and limiting how much fun you can really have with it cuz if you cant afford the season pass you dont get all that content csgo is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money and make them happy they did it maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game 1 for rank 1 for smurfing and 1 for hacking

edit i cant completely reccomend csgo again because there are too many problems mm is still a ing joke casual is just a cluster and dm is  if you wanna play csgo go get cevo faceit or go on the community servers csgo is still broken as  with ladder hitboxes and other  that volvo doesnt care about because they are too busy making new animations for knives and creating new operations _ 310 rating still stands this is a honest review of the game counter strike global offensive or csgo lets just start off by saying that previous counter strike games really have been amazing now csgo is the newest installment in the series what seems and is a fun game is plauged with problems lets start off by the community the csgo community is one of the most toxic communities out there just as bad as the dota2 community they will put down new players troll and just overall have bm while playing the game really valve does nothing to punish griefers and others so the trolling will never really end another problem is hackers hackers plauge the world of csgo at all ranks and skill levels some may be blatant and some may be more conservative point is that valve has really not done anything to fight hackers vac sucks and takes weeks to ban a hacker while overwatch has been implemented its a time consuming process that cant always be accurate because of the low price of the game hackers can make endless accounts and continue to feed valve the 15 dollars for csgo so that they can continue to ruin other peoples time valve really has ignored the community in many ways aswell not implementing 128 tick servers adding stupid stuff like music intros to players and not doing productive things like fixing exploits or overpowered things like grenade tagging a massive problem is also skins they may look pretty but they ruin the game now i understand that valve will never take skins out of the game because it is a massive amount of revenue for them but skins really only lead to professional players throwing matches nothing can really be done about this as much as the big orgas organizations try to stop it from happening players will find a way to do it and will throw for skins when competing in small tournaments smurfs are considered a problem by some but i see no feaseable way to stop them so i will not be talking about that surrendering is also an issue teams playing competitive matchmaking can surrender a game but only if one of the players decides to sacrifice himself and abandon the match getting a cooldown when playing against a hacker in addition to getting aimbotted time after time 1 player must be punished for abandoning the match in order for the team to forfeit this game can be good but valve is not doing what they need to do to fix the issues and instead adds their cash grabs to the game the issues will persist and more and more players will leave the game this game had great potential and is fun at first until you play enough then you ake notice and you wait for every patch that is supposed to fix things just to see that it is a new set of skins for some new stupid collection today i will be leaving csgo maybe not forever but until they fix their issues i will not be coming back tldr great game with tons of issues that valve gives zero s about rating 310
