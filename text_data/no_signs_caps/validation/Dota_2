the real dota 2 dota is a competitive game of action and strategy played both professionally and casually incompetently by millions of enslaved passionate fans russians worldwide players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes carries forming two teams of five players five feeders radiant heroes then battle their dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape waging campaigns of cunning stealth and outright warfare raging in an unknown language and teamfighting with one rampage victor irresistibly colorful on the surface addictive dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity which requires no infact takes an infinite amount of your life away every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike that allow players to screw with their allies and get their teams killed this is one of the reasons that the dota phenomenon has continued to grow dota will have more rage quitting and all chat abuse than any other game originating as a fanmade warcraft 3 modification dota was an instant underground hit after coming to valve the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience russia so that the rest of the world can experience the same core gameplay but with the level of polish that only valve can provide learn from these ingenious people and become inspired to spread their knowledge with the rest of the world get a taste of the game that has enthralled millions will happily teach you fluent russian all for the sweet price of $0 just choose your server [imgurcom] < link note original description by valve edited by myself

this game ruined my life i recommend everyone to play dota 2 and not lol nor hon  dont get me wrong i am not hating or anything i was from hon for like 23 years before dota 2 was released and tried lol and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to hon dota 2 is a great game an awesome game i really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it i say mechanics are well designed what makes a hero op is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it this is a team game people so team work is a must unless you are solo queuing then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around monster gamers are real dota 2 has taught me a lot of things you can only be good at something if you focus on it learn from mistakes be aware of your surroundings trust your instinct use common sense trusting on your team to always have your back believing in your capabilities always try to be better than you were yesterday and that the comebacks are real this game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds a mere game that brings people together not just friends but complete strangers too dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten all in all i recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain suffering and torment because at the end you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better ps calm down its just a game

alright listen up instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians im going to tell you how dota 2 really is at its core in a nutshell dota 2 is a great game but a terrible experience at the same time you want to keep going back to it but you also hate to go back why one word community dota 2s community is for the most part rude and hateful and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting moba its unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away at the best of times often its much worse and i would prefer not to go into the details sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you havent actually done anything wrong occasionally though you come across friendly players and when that happens the game is a pure joy to play however since the game is 5v5 coming across four nice players at the same time if youre solo queueing is a rarity why then have i played the game for over 2000 hours the sensation of winning your determination to keep playing despite of the discouraging community is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory that sweet moment when you see the enemy ancient blow up and look back on the match remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying but even a victory can come with a grain of salt many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning there is a mute option but that doesnt stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat people can intentionally feed the enemy team ignore their own team teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player its really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time going ranked doesnt really solve the problem either at least not completely ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill it feels much more professional and tryhardish although you meet nice players more often nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell having played some matches in ranked i can say the mode isnt hate free i had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode another problem with ranked is that like i said its more tryhard many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the this is ranked you better be a damn good player mentality but dont get me wrong dota 2 is a great game in itself and thats why i keep going back to it the core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well no technical issues to speak of not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so of which i have had none myself graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them all the various spells and abilites look great the game is very deep and complex with tons of items skill and item builds and strategies to learn it can be a bit terrifying to beginners but once you get the hang of things its engaging all the playable heroes are well balanced although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being op and free to play from the start thats another thing the game does right all the heroes are free and playable from the start unlike dota 2s undeniably very successful competitor league of legends dota 2s microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff which means there are zero pay to win elements in the game it really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game if youre one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you you have a better chance of not finding dota 2 so terrible to put it roughly in perspective playing dota 2 is like playing skyrim but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make calling you a fooping idiot every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective failed to kill alduin uninstall skyrim noob dont know how to make dragonbone armor learn to play tard it would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures would it not sadly thats how dota 2s community is having played the game as long as i have i would say that you are better off not playing dota 2 the game is fun when youre winning because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine which is 50% of the time and sometimes not even when youre winning it isnt the losses that make the game unpleasant its the unfriendly people often your day will just be worse after playing dota 2 instead of it cheering you up as games do people will tell you that dota 2 is great but that greatness comes with a price do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view this review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what its really like not just the great things if you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis then youre good to go the game is at its best when you play with friends and dont have to worry about getting a stick in the mud player on your team great game with bad community

this game helps you realize the stuggles that were present during the cold war and reinforces your fear of russians or at least playing with them team up with south americans to battle the russians and receive more negative feedback from your teammates than your ex girlfriend gave you about your small  once you realize that the south americans are also your enemies you can play on their servers to escape them because everyone knows that they only play on the us servers to slowly damage our mental stability to aid them in their everlasting mission to feel like they dont live in a third world country 1010

so here are some limericks about dota 2 that may help you decide whether to play or not sorry in advance there once was a man named zeus his team put him mid on the loose he could totally  but had no escape and so he got ganked like a moose one time pugna i tried to play but forgot that there is no way to get more than five health without massive wealth and bounty hunter stuck his peepee in my bum over and over and over and i cried sometimes if there is a dragon you need to purchase a dagon and then you go zap and all cross the map people made the excuse they were laggin nyx nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx there once was a brave little feller who wanted to be the best speller but he was russian and people are s so now he lives in a cellar there once was a brave little a bear who smoked into roshans lair so hard he tried but he got bashed and died and now his team is giving him the glare if you play dota beware because its sometimes a pit of dispair advice you will heed but your teem will still feed and then you will switch to solitair so i just wasted a solid 25 minutes making jenky limericks about dota just play the game its awesome

ive always wanted to go to russia to learn the culture eat and drink and see the sights but i cannot do that as it is expensive and im busy doing my uni work but then i found dota 2 this free learning course teaches you all about russians and their culture i can even speak decent russian however these russian people can get quite angry and annoying they often shout the phrase  and bring you to the depths of insanity i got forced to drink my sorrows away during the beginning of the course but it was worth it in the end if you dont have the time and money to travel to russia id suggest you pick up dota 2 a fantastic learning resource 810

at first i thought this game was pretty good but that was until the first time i was called a feeder dota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork except the community only does three things 1 call each other fgs and berate one another for slightly foolish decisions 2 do solo farm and try to win the match by themselves which never works especially if they are playing against a team of 5 players in a party also known as a five stack 3 make fun of and ruin everything for new players if you want to learn how to play dota 2 you either need a really good guide or a good friend who has more than 500 hours into the game the tutorial just teaches you the basics no you cant learn by yourself by playing matchmaking with random people all youll learn from the other players is that you suck because youre new and dont understand any of the tactics and that the best course of action would be to uninstall theres also the fact that some people create new steam accounts so they can be matched up against newbies and annihilate everyone also this game stole all my friends we used to play other games now they play nothing other than dota 2 and one of them has spent $40 in the game on skins cosmetic items that add nothing to the gameplay you can buy some of the best games on steam for less i repeat less than $40 and then he told me he only plays dota because he cant afford any games on steam so there terrible community steals your friends incredibly addictive for some people dont touch this game i spent way too much time hating myself while playing this never again edit 172 people read this review wow also i have to say i think the ingame tutorials are better than the actual game because the actual game has only one map unlike the tutorials i know this is pretty standard for moba games but for me this contributes greatly to actually ruining variety and fun in the gameplay its just all the same tactics over and over on the same map this doesnt only mean less variety but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better on another note this game is like the opposite of everything i like about tf2 unbalanced classes according to google every dota herochampionclasswhatever the hell is overpowered only a single map relies too much on teamwork when its hard to find online whereas tf2 benefits from teamwork but still its not the key to winning a game and its much easier to achieve teamwork because tf2 doesnt rely nearly as hard on your earlygame the earlygame in dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you setting the outcome of the match in stone almost literally during the first ten minutes of the game and also a horrible community not saying tf2s community is good but hell its miles above dota dont really know why i am comparing this game to tf2 maybe because valve made both games but still just wanted to throw out there some actual criticisms about the game itself and not the community now some people have been telling me pfft just block the trash talkers that doesnt change anything theyre still horrible at teamwork which like i said is the entire point of the game and if you block them you cant coordinate with them basically its not only a bad game for new players because you suck its also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks except for koreans whenever you see one in a game bam you already know his team has won overall i think dota nay the whole moba genre has great potential but its just too bad ive yet to see any game in the genre actually achieve to fulfill it edit 2 i just came back to this game and tried it out again the hopes that maybe it has gotten better no theres still absolutely no communication between the players except for casual pings here and there seriously there are tonnes of balancing issues in the game and the one character that stands out the most is sniper he has good abilities and does real good damage at a real fast rate if you play the game right he can easily annihilate two to three heroes by himself later on in the game frankly he is cheap and it is incredibly easy to kill steal with him valve is a company structured in a way that if youre employed there you dont really need to do these things you dont need to patch bugs from a game you dont need to fix balancing issues at valve the employees primary concern is getting recognition if you add something that looks cool youre gonna get recognition if youre going to fix something youre not because youre not showing off your creativity or imagination youre doing an important job to ensure that the product works as intended noone cares for that give me more cosmetics theres also the kill stealing now you get much more experience and gold as well as the kill credit if you actually deliver the killing blow yep just the last hit no questions asked it doesnt matter if youve reduced someone from full to 1% health and someone from your team pops out of nowhere to take the kill credit and leave you with a measly amount of gold and little experience a lot of players hate these kill thieves but you know what thats exactly what this game encourages to screw other players over couldnt say the gold and experience be divided equally between the two players based on the damage they did nope instead the players are forced to hate each other and if you are an actually fair player who doesnt want to rely on these cheap tactics youll be behind in the game what is this defense of the capitalists i mentioned that one friend spent $40 on items in dota 2 i actually played this game with him again and he has spent about well $300 on the game thats enough to buy 4 copies of gta v here in australia he was also recently hacked and had $200 worth of items stolen from him thats what you get when you blatantly overprice some items and drive the games economy into the ground refer to the previous joke on capitalism now the worst part of this game in my opinion is the long matches matches usually take anywhere between 30 to 50 minutes the longest ive seen is 70 minutes youre not going to have time to go to the toilet people with indigestion beware i bet valve is in on a conspiracy to make profit from increased adult diaper sales youre not going to have time to eat youre not going to have time to speak to people while playing the game or do little chores around the house that youre parents need you to do because youre impatient and if youre gonna get addicted to the game like a lot of people are youre not gonna have time to have a life see my russian cousin it also really sucks that when your early game sucks youre going to be stuck in a losing match where you know youve lost and all your team is doing is delaying the inevitable its not enjoying to lose and if you quit at that pointthe consequences will never be the same literally the more you abandon games doesnt matter if the game crashes on you or if you have a slow internet connection and the entire thing stopped working or if you have a really slow connection and it messes up and boots you out of the game or if you have a slow computer like my $300 friend and your entire computer crashes and you cant get back in the game the more you will be punished so on your first few abandons you will get low priority matchmaking games low priority games are pretty much like the normal priority games on steroids so more insults less teamwork more s more kill steals then as you keep abandoning games the punishment gets more severe each time the amount of low prio games you get for abandoning never goes down this game would be much better if it was made by communists

this is the best moba game ever made simply a masterpiece but has the worst community you will ever find i sometimes end up frustrated tired and in a bad mood when i cant win a single game in 6 hours of straight gameplay just because of bad players who get in your games to ruin them theyrere not just noobs they just love trolling and ing up others people fun if youre noob and wish to play dota make sure you have patience and time becoming good in this game is really hard takes years to master and youll never get to call yourself a pro if you decided to start dota do not play online practice with bots first read guides read items and abilities descriptions first you got to study before playing in a real game with humans it can be very frustrating for old players to deal with people that simple come to try out a new game into their matches and ruin them please someday you will realize what i mean with this i play dota since 2007 dota 1 and i have hit my keyboard laughed yelld to my father for no reason and confesing my frustration to people because of a bad streak in dota let my bad mood affect my scores in school and made me lose friends lost many good stuff i could have done outgame because i said one more match which became 10 more matches and ended up totally frustrated without winning one of them unable to sleep at all those nights due to this to the careless community and the fact that your entire life can be affected by dota and how it makes you feel i cant recommend this game dota is not a simple game you have to be very careful at the moment you decide to play this

dota is less of a game more of a tool of self discovery in fact thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake games are designed to be enjoyable and fun  enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota especially for those in low priority they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either every facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know theyre destined to be although it seems at first to be a team game of 5v5 this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers barracks and ancient these objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat dont worry about the other team theyre fighting amongst themselves and dont matter anyway  remember youre better than your teammates and its inconceivable that theres any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes the interface and minimap should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as   and no courier gg my team are  ff but dont worry if you cant understand its not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that dont need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful if you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding dont fret they are likely jealous of your superior skills and cant understand that they are actually the ones letting you down just remind yourself of that one game you had that went freakishly well and make fun of someones build 1010 worst game ever

the game itself is good had a lot of fun but the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry and then fail at it what results in a waste of time it usually starts already a hero selection people dont communicate only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy too bad because the game itself is good the community is for 80% flamers egotrippers wannabe carry players very rude

valve is afraid some fat kid might commit suicide for being called a noob and with this horribly broken matchmaking i see no sane reason to play this game anytime soon and because icefrog and the his devs ignorance about the eu servers turning to shit because of russians who select english on purpose because their own servers on east is unbrearable with the horrible people who mostly feed and rage in their games talking smack all the time now dont misunderstand this is a great game with huge potential but the truth of it is its rotten from the bad matchmaking and somewhat horrid and lack of brain community main reasons not to play this game goes undisputed as follows 1 russians ruining games talking russian when they clearly selected english as the preferred language in case anyone hasnt noticed dota is a team game 2 solo queue has been removedthis means that you can be matched against an enemy 5 stack when you are playing alone 3 no real community q&a support from developers and complete ignorance on the game dev forum mods deleting posts thats not deemed worthy even though there is issues surrounding the topics 4 ranked is viritually a joke in comparison to normal mm the only difference is a number for self gratification purposes it viritually means nothing when most mmrs you are still playing with complete  5 broken soloqueue at times matches you whether you are alone or 2 players playing together you will often or notdepending on your luck you will be matched with an enemy full 5 man team communicating in game while your team is just 221 or just all solo players this creates a huge disadvantage at the start of the match now valve has it ever occured to you in the small strains left of what corporate moral fiber you have that you should fix dota 2s blatant community issues is this really how you get out of your responsibilities by ignoring and deleting users expressing concern in a noninflammatory way its shameful considering how much of a profit youre making on it at least youd have the dignity to give us something back no ive personally almost quit this game two times because i cant handle the community and players i am matched with constantly they dont speak my language share my mindset or my skill level the least except an actual good match on some occations which leaves me with a horrible experience most of the time

an amazing competitive game that has been ruined by the playerbase unless you have four other friends to play with you dont wanna try it after 1000 hours of gameplay with random people mostly i can honstly say  dont play it dont play it unless its with friends if you do however decide to give it a shot youre in for a lot of alking and griefing people will also abuse report tool a lot and refuse to speak english on english servers have fun
not recommended
its fun till you realize you get reported for no reason and have no way of countering the report or explainning yourself the issue is if you get reported you can not get items in the games till you play a number of matches which takes about 30 to 60 minutes to play this is a problem cause anyone can report you for the three following which is not your fault or a way to avoid them its ridiculous they dont even tell you why and you can end up either playing those matches without any rewards or forced to not to play ever again this is a major problem who the hell thought this was a good idea

welcome to a game a false promises now leave before you get addicted this game will ruin your personality cause you to drift into a limbo state between insanity and reality and make you lose all hope in the nature of the human race no matter how good you will ever be you are always trash think otherwise something that a trash player would say the learning curve is infinite nobody has ever completely mastered the game your individual skill is ranked and measured in a system that only counts your winloss in a game where 5 players must work together to win dont bother narrowing your search results all the rusperus are pretty much the same welcome to dota youre trash now unistall you  bylat  ing  010

i played this game because friends asked me to with 20 hours under my belt i can safely say i still have absolutely no idea what the  im doing this game is not beginnerfriendly if this is your first moba you need to start with something lighter because dota 2 will completely overwhelm you theres very little balance players will treat you like trash because most of the community is built of dota 1 players who already know the insandouts and you will struggle to find the right guides that will show you what youre doing wrong if youre playing with friends who are much better than you youll only be holding them back if youre playing with friends who are much worse than you youll grow tired of playing with them dota 2 is like a fine wine  a lot of fun for somebody experienced tastes like pee for a newbie

after playing 1500 hours like there is 200 on the 2nd one i have finally quit this game here is the reasons 1broken stupid  meta  icefrogs nerfs and buffs first of all the guy who makes all the balancing things doesnt even play the game itself if a hero gets picked too much in the pro scene  icefrog will nerf the  out of that hero and make it unplayable expember spirit or he just buffs a hero like riki since the day he came in dota 2 riki is generally easy to counter in high skill pubs but he wrecks the  out of new players and nerf a hero like crystal maiden both nerfing her damage movespeed etc 2the ing communitymatchmaking russians on english lang and ranked aaand here we are at the best part of dota  the community it is filled with immature kids who will rage at you and say stupid  like omfg u so noob learn2play feggit y u use midas on big creep  its literally cancer for someone sensitive aganist stupidity  believe me after spending hours and hours inside those people you will slowly become one of them or atleast it will cause depression  anger issues ranked system of dota is just simply broken there is no difference between a 35k player and a 1k player  it is all the same the points are just there so some  can brag about his non existent 6k mmr liehell i typed a comment under a vid related to dota some guy just came in and said he had 6k and you are a ing noob you should kill myself omfg and the public matchmaking slightly better than ranked a little bit because 1 out of a kajillion billion chance you can actually meet with people who are funny and nice to play with i made a lot of friends like this but believe me most of the time you pick eu server with eng language you will get russians who farm dagon on cm in hardlane and never communicate with you you will slightly learn russian because these guys never speak english even if they know it and since they love to scream in mic like idi nahuy pidor suka blyat padaroshnik pizdec bla bla bla you will instantly learn mottheeerr rrrrussia accenteither you will get not being racist here  but dota really does make you racist esta muerto mexican fellas  spanish people on american server or russians with 9000 ping btw dont ever write guides like i did i innocently wanted to help the other new players with a few guides about the heroes i know really well some armenian kid called me a  with his poor english for telling people to use midas on the big creep in jungle camps to get a level advantage 3lastly because i dont need to say anything more why this game is so piece of  the ing effects on you why do you even want to play this game  it is like eating an apple with 4000 worms inside anyways arguing with a dota player made me realise that this game completely destroys your social life and your ability to think go try it yourself try to say something opposite to these s there is a big real life world for you to discover out here get a hobby instead of playing this so im done please never ever ever start playing this game

dota 2 is a bad game for multiple reasons it has some nice rewarding moments during gameplay but most of the time you will find yourself screaming at your teamates pulling your hair our throwing the computer across the room and cursing russians brazilians and pracitacally any other ethnicty that does not speak english never have i played a game that has made experience such pure rage towards other players and towards myself pros team based mechanics that require cooperation punishment systems for people who grief or abandon good art lore and character design large free roster of playable characters a valve spin off of the orignial dota a warcraft iii mod cosmetics cons crappy boring tutorial and does not prepare new players terrible match making system broken  gameplay no true skillshots with the exception of meat hook hookshot and sacred arrow support heroes are generally unattractive and no one wants to buy wards or courier exessive intentional counter picking which ruins your game from the very beginning filled with people from different nationalities who do not speak english usually russains which means communication lots of griefers and trolls who threaten to feed abandon or simply say mid or feed and claim the middle lane by their divine right usually resulting in them feeding the enemy team and never ganking if they are arrogant pubs are awful and unless you queue with a friend you will most likely suffer by yourself 100% team game meaning it requires synergy and cooperations which most pub teams dont possess the game is super addictive and you wont want to shut down the game and do something else unless you are pretty much forced to you wont even want to get up to eat or  harsh cruel community ingame and out of game even towards the games devs diretide 2013 incident lucky alpine stalker set controversy etc cosmetics yes its a con aswell due to the fact that it ushers in a wave of casual players who dont really care about actually gameplay this game has some good points but the cons clearly outweigh the pros despite the hours i have clocked on this game most of my experiences have been terrible and it has negatively impacted my social life and made me a hateful person at times dont even bother with this game

this game is total garbage with the worst community ive ever seen in any multiplayer game the game will lower your iq if you indulge in it over extended periods of time and will also ruin your mental state caution it causes depression and explicit anger mmr is broken and every server you play on is russian the only good thing is that youll acquire some knowledge about the russian language aswell as some of their mental capabilities if they even exist

this is a game that will quene you with people that have 40% of your hours played this game will show you the worst scum of the worst and will favor them in a trial this  game will show you that in this cyber world there is a hell and you are in it once you start palying rankeds this game will take away your will to get better at it by throwing hords of russians peruvians s and whatnot who speak only their native language but start playing a ranked in which team coordination and communication are a must this game will take away your hopes of a normal match and it will leave you with a bad taste in your mounth once you lose a game by being the only one that did his job right and is not feeding overall i give this  game a 410 the game itself is worth at least a 9 but when you put russians and  of the entire world together without putting them in their own servers or restricting them by their gameplay this is what you get people that cannot communicate and play together to win i promise you this games community will make you loose all hope in humanity and in everything that is good if youre unlucky you will end up as one of them i for this matter am abandoning this ship after 13k hours played i finally figured this game is being ed by its own community because it fails to set up people who can communicate i might come back and play it once valve makes people stay in their respective regions by creating dedicated servers  like lol  but untill then i will no longer participate in this  thank you and good luck trying to make something out of this game you will need it fyi im pretty sure there are some typos and grammatical errors but i dont really bother checking them right now regards steve a once diehard fan of this game who was hoping valve would do something about the community but was dissapointed over and over again
