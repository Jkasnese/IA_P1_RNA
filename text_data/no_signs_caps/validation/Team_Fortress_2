can you name any other unmodded first person shooter that lets you play as a cocky and fast bostonian that can slap the hell out of urine throwing australian campers with a fresh atlantic fish wrapped in fine christmas lights eat a bucket of fried proccessed poultry over their corpses and then get hit with an exploding cannonball launched from an africanceltic one eyed alcoholic who can leap yards into the air from his own explosives while weilding a mystic ancient talking ghost claymore i thought so

the vicious cycle of team fortress 2 first when youll arrive in the game youll want weapons tons of them then youll see that everyone has hats and youll want these a tons of them then youll realize that hats doesnt matter only skill count so youll want a lot of skills tons of them then new weapons will be added and youll want them all of them then a new hat will be added and youll want it cause itll be fancy on your main class then youll realize again that you dont give a damn about hats all is about is skill then when you have waited for 3 years new weapons will be added and youll want them and then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this met great friends and youll have a server wheres you feeling like home and you discovered so much things via the community it learnt you so much then the rude reality of life bring you on earth and this game is here waiting for you to play 123 hours and youll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here

team fortress 2 being ranked as the third mostplayed game [steamchartscom] on steam team fortress 2 is probably one of the best freetoplay games weve got why is it so popular lets take a look shall we first off the obvious its free 100% free this means its accessible to everyone on steam this is just the icing on the cake though what really shines about tf2 is the game itself team fortress 2 usually consists of two teams red and blue going head to head against each other sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other there are many many maps and modes such as payload capture points and mann vs machine but the general idea no matter the map or mode is to kill everything that moves and my god is it fun to do so the game has 9 playable mercenaries each actually being a certain class each class is divided into 3 different roles offense defense and support lets go over each role and class offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team these are your main attack force scouts are the speedy hit and run class with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers which gives them not only power but mobility due to the ability known as rocket jumping the pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map overall the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off engineers can build sentry guns for effective area defense as well as build teleporters and dispensers for logistical support of the team support classes cannot hold the fight on their own but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their teams favor they offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed the support classes are always handy to have around medics are the team healers capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats snipers excel at long range also eliminating key threats as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates next lets look at the presentation tf2 has a very unqiue art style its somewhat cartoonish but very appealing its simple and uncomplex but it doesnt need to be complex its simplicity is its strength everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on what a specific model or item is and they all stand out the soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy especially the main theme i personally have it as a ringtonealarm tone on my smartphone  one of the best aspects of tf2 is the steam workshop users can submit designs for items and weapons and possibly have them added to the game a very lucrative submarket has also emerged from this game in the form of the crate keys thats a whole different ballgame in and of itself so we wont get into it here during normal gameplay on most servers you can obtain random items weapons and sometimes crates and tauntsthrough the item drops system you can only receive so many drops per week and you will get them randomly as you play you can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenarys loadout or you can use them to craft other items hats and weapons you can take multiples of items and craft them into scrap then reclaimed metal then refined metal you can then use these metals to craft specific class weaponsitems among other things the crafting system is simple yet robust with lots of possiblities some of it is very luck based you can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the steam market allinall team fortress 2 is just a very fun game endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game especially if you play with friends on your favorite server probably the best freetoplay game on steam httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid383235670 highly recommended be sure to check out nerd house gaming for more reviews

team fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items andor hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor

oh tf2 oh tf2 weve come a long way but everything will end eventually no matter how fun it was if you are looking for the games details read the positive reviews i will have a little rant here a few years ago i found this game through the famous meet the series after i started playing i was instantly hooked by the amazing variety of gameplay even though i do not play anymore do to the reason i will give below i am still active in the community some of you might know as gilgamesh from opengriefing the game with the nine classes and huge amount of weapons that come with it tf2 is a game which you can play for days even months each class has their own individual role which is completely unique to it you can play in all sort of ways and there is so much to do it rarely feels repeditive the community is nice and although most do not appreciate the sight of a new player there is still a huge amount of nice people i my self have taught 4 players on how to play tf2 whom i personally dont even know and i had great fun in doing so and there more people out there that do the same the game has a series of cosmedic items which add a lot of life and color into it you can dress the big muscle guy called the heavy with his huge machine gun up with a fairy custom or you can turn the german doctor called the medic into a ww2 german infantryman of the battle of stalingrad these are two examples of thousands of possibilities there are many game modes and dozens of maps for each which let you play the game for an unbelievable amount of time with out getting bored once these are just the official maps there are tensofthousands of community maps which also enhance the gaming experience the community tf2 is a very old game yet it is one of the most played multiplayer games even today the community is very committed and it was the community that made the game what it is today valve kept the game fresh by releasing updates that always added more content with which you could play with your friends and have loads of fun with that being said here comes the problem as i said tf2 has a very committed and loyal community even though the game is from todays standards as old as the bread crumbs that are left in a toaster that one day have the fortune of being vaporized leaving the toaster as dust now valve always showed their appreciation for this through out the year by adding fresh content this however has changed valve like other companies has noticed the potential of modern competitive games one genre of which is mobas it is also very obvious that they have grown old of tf2 and want to work on different things their plan to keep the game alive while slowly leaving it was to let their loyal community take over which i have to say is quite an honorable thing to do however they have completely failed at it the problem is the community may be able to handle parts of the game but not the entire game it self it is impossible do to many factors by this i mean the community might be able to add content like hats and taunts to the game but they can not expand the gaming experience the expanding the gaming experience is exactly what made tf2 a special game every year there was always something new to try out and after doing that the normal game was appealing again and the loop continued but instead of fixing the issue they just want to pull it through till the end like dragging a bleeding body to the hospital but knowing that it wont make it warning rant they also treat the community wrong they have gotten to used to the community of tf2 treating them like some kind of divine council they think anything will satisfy it an example of this is the ing ducks some people complained that the end of the line not including snowplow with valves response being it is too complicated for new players from what i have heard though the did not include the map due to it not reaching their standards which is fine by me also the lack of weapons that were promised by the creator of the animation did not appear which was upsetting but still bearable what really shoved the middle finger up my  though was the ducks the ing ducks that cost 5 ing euros for ing ducks is this some sort of joke was valve thinkingayy lmao ducks are funny right from valve and the end of the line team without the ducks i would have nothing to complain about but if they seriously think that ducks will satisfy their loyal community after they miss out on the promised weapons and a new game mode then must have ing plumbum in their water supply they tried making up to it by rushing 3 new weapons which are all useless and uncreative the creativity is what counts not the effectiveness of the weapon preaccess now for tf2 also another issue is beta maps they adapted the method of their platform into tf2 they release unfinished  act like it is finished but still needs fixing and let the community do all the work instead of actually using already made maps by the community or getting of their asses and finishing them the beta map cactus has a ing holes everywhere it is also so monotone i cringe when thinking valve could even put it in the game what they appear to think of the community they take us for a bunch of clowns juggling around in the circus with a red nose and wacky hair riding on a onewheel making toot toot sounds they put disclaimers on their  for expert players only they write in captions under their new preaccess game mode who ever complained to them that some game modes for too complicated someone with 0 neurons in their skull succeeding at surpassing the stupidity of a pigeon the game mode is just as complicated as the other game modes there is nothing that could irritate new players if you exclude all the unnecessary glitches hats as it worked in the past adding more cosmetic items usually was endorsed with a lot of positive responses from the community this was because they added fun cosmetics while adding more content for gameplay it was a balance of a innovation and fun always the right mix but now they just try to make us suffocated in cosmetics this can be do to 2 reasons 1 they just want to add more cosmetics to recreate barbie simulator 2 they realized that the game is dying and wana milk as much  out of it as they can before it goes downhill same thing goes for ducks servers i will try to keep this short most valve servers the servers i personally enjoy playing on the most have  beta maps on them most tf2 servers went from tf2 to dota 2 and csgo i remember always finding at least 3 full servers of a single map for each map a year or two ago now i have luck if i find a single full server of a map to end this as i mentioned before they realized that the game is dying and wanna milk as much  out of it as they can before it goes downhill the game is in fact actually going down the  look at all the tf2 youtubers star_ and jerma have stopped playing the game why because there is nothing new and they have a bitter taste because of the recent decisions of valve regarding tf2 so what if two youtubers quit playing the game it happens all the time when a pretty much tf2 only channel with at least 90% of its subscribers being tf2 related quits the game because the company is ing up then it is very obvious that there is something wrong this is not just youtube it is also on my steam friends list i used to see at least 10 people playing the game at any given time now it is rare to see anyone at all play it and look at the size of that list with the majority being hardcore tf2 players this game is dying and valve needs to seriously step in before it bleeds out for good

its so sad to be writing this but the truth needs to be said so lets start here i had such a wonderful experience playing this game not only because of the game itself but because of everything it gave me i can tell you a few things 1 i met my first friend on steam while playing tf2 weve built a beautiful friendship i consider him as my brother and he considers me as his sister we live kinda far from each other but weve already met in real life 2 i got closer to a friend of mine that loves tf2 we had some discussionsproblems in the past then someday we started to play together and it feels like nothing has ever happened 3 it opened my eyes about a plenty of things on internet i got scammed many times people stole from me when i was noob which made me learn more about trust those and more facts made me love this game completely and now im not recommending it valve stopped making people happy by people i mean those who had even better moments while playing it you see an update hatsmiscsbugslag and thats it of course i also wasted money there i used to get so attracted by beautiful stuff till i realize what i was doing you gotta buy something though if youre f2p you dont know how to play you suck and wooow theyre putting more guns in the store all banned from competitive for being too op or theyre really bad anyway i seriously would like to join a server now and have fun ah yeah theyre empty because people are in trade servers just to show how much rich they actually are the worst kind of blind is the one that doesnt want to see why valve why are you letting this happen to your game i wanna die from laughing with my friends again i wanna recommend this game again and tell people how much its worth its not a goodbye ill go back sometimes to see if i can have at least more 5 minutes of fun in the same way tf2s marked my life i hope it does for other people

i bought the game when it was still $20 it was the first game i had ever bought on steam and around that time in fall of 2008 there were only three characters updated with achievement weapons trading and hats werent in existence yet and the game truly was a teamwork required type of game every class felt balanced and fair with each one having their own respective strengths and weaknesses even the achievement weapons brought a nice change of pace from the normal minigun and bonesaw you actually felt accomplished when you did the achievements because you were rewarded the community was surprisingly welcoming and a majority of my steam friends came from tf2 at the time we had thought that valve was going to update the rest of the characters with their own achievements and that would be all and for awhile we were right one by one the rest of the classes got their own weapons and achievements and by july 8th 2010 happy birthday to me the engineer was the last character updated the game felt complete three years in the making now i think everyone knows whats coming next before i get into detail on the update that changed or in my opinion ruined everything let me just say that valve had already put hats into the game months before way back in august 2009 i was perfectly fine with the hats they added a sense of personality to your classes and all you had to do in order to get them was play the game a novel concept i know hats were the only thing given to you as a random drop back then i should probably point out that i took about a year break away from gaming at this point in time due to real life while i was away the mannconomy update happened this update wasnt like any of the others this update added tons of brand new weapons and hats along with the addition of an ingame store and trading system to get them when i eventually returned to tf2 the game wasnt about the objectives or teamwork or even being the best player anymore all the game was about now was collecting the most hats and weapons you could get your hands on the achievements didnt matter anymore because you could just buy whatever you wanted or just find it as a random drop since they updated it to more than just hats the game that i fell in love with spending sleepless nights for years was all for nothing at the drop of a hat quite literally im not mad at valve for what they did from a business standpoint this is the smartest thing theyve ever done but whenever i see the game in my steam library i just get a deep feeling of nostalgia and longing for something that could have been i hope that one day ill be able to relive those fond memories i have with team fortress 2

i have to thank team fortress 2 for leading me for several thousand hours of gaming throughout the years i love all the friends i made along the way aswell but something changed in tf2 the community has nearly been abandoned by all the old players leaving behind a community that comes off as toxic tf2 used to be my favorite game while update and update have many asking whats the deal with all these let downs valve has started giving tf2 the short end of the stick as csgo and dota 2 take the spotlight as tf2 and the community is right now i dont recommend getting into it anymore both the game and the community are now a drag

you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain i hate to admit it but the game defeated me i used to not give a f about hats killstreaks or expensive items in general then i traded my first hat my first rare item as time went i desired more and more and more suddenly it was not about playing but collecting pixels the game got me the joy was replaced with greed i had to pull the plug i had to escape i have became one of them this is no longer a harmless video game it is a dealer and you are the junkie avoid it or suffer as i and many others did your call

team fortress 2 was one of the best games i had ever had the privilege to experience a few years ago of course tf2 is no longer the unique teambased game it used to be it has been narrowed down to an unfair unbalanced mess of who has the shiniest pink hats on trade_minecraft how fast can you get kicked from every valve server because some stupid kids think its their private achievement server and how to get outskilled by someone using a more broken overpowered weaponclass team fortress 2 also hosts one of the nastiest communities to date right below garrys mod and dayz i guarentee you every server you join you will be greeted by several bronies and furries spamming lenny faces stupid shrek memes and pootis if you like getting penalized for simply playing the game this is the one for you if youre 10 and still think memes are funny this is the one for you if you like having an overall bad time this is the one for you team fortress 2 also suffers from a severe lack of content updates every few months that go by they will add more cosmetics and taunts to ruin the game and community even further they do not add balanced maps or weapons they do not balance the current game mechanics such as pelletdamage spread and random crits they do not penalize those who are literally unable to play the game at an acceptable level for example if you get a team full of idiots who installed steam the previous day they get to stay with their 300700 ping slimeball community avatars and inability to speak english in english servers they will also vote kick you usually selecting the no reason given option for they cannot speak english overall if you are really looking forward to making your day a bad one play the steaming pile of  that is team fortress 2
