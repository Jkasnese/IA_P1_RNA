there are some good things about fm 2015 which might make it interesting for someone who has never played the series before for me as a pretty hardcore player i feel like im in a vicious circle just feeding my malcontent about the game but cannot break my addiction and hell ive had many spells of fm addiction throughout the last fifteen years but they are only truly rewarding when i feel i can make a difference with my particular style of play and my preferred scenario is the lower league model excessive scouting wheeler dealer kind of approach which is worth very little in 2015 the thing that works the least for me is that i dont feel i can truly play the game the way i would want to play it my expectation is that somehow getting a few amazing players in a league 2 or conference team should show but whether it shows or not depends on chance player ratings are very position dependent with central midfielders taking the runt of bad ratings however amazing they may seem so i might spend hours searching for the coolest prospects i can find fishing for work permits for my noneu conquests but getting phenomenal players on a mediocre squad matters very little the general feeling is of a wooden game bizarre things happen which seem to defy reason some are buggy like goalkeeper reactions some are fixable via lengthy tactical tinkering like defending corners and others are the worst of all monotonous long distance goals maybe on tv a fast player outrunning a defender unless the latter fumbles it keep dreaming half competent goalkeepers seem harder to find than the proverbial needle and then theres an aggressive randomness to how a team behaves and matches unfold my concede within the first ten minutes syndrome seems unshakable i am not saying it cannot be done but the feeling is that it is something that needs to be fixed from the get go rather than something that should be reasonably fine under normal conditions like corners and when theres a huge quality gap between your players and the opposition it all gets hard to fathom so why have i played hundreds of hours of this on the one hand the addiction on the other that elusive feeling when things actually do go right and you win an amzing match but i am left frustrated because fm seems to be going nowhere the development of the game fails to address key issues year after year a balanced match engine a bit of flair and a bit of the unexpected some character and individuality to the players unbiased ratings consistency and logic in the transfer system of course its not easy and theres a lot of back and forth in trying to get it all together but considering the heritage of this series i cannot avoid a distinct sensation of complacency padded with the occasional ui revamp or a couple of shiny new features bottom line if you have not played this yet maybe wait it out some more like until si decide to take the bull by the horns and create another classic there are many people who enjoy working on this game and its database is a treasure trove an inimitable advantage for anyone interested in joining the fray the risk with taking it up is that even if you get it for free time costs incurred are not worth the experience and chances are your passion for football will be your downfall in spite of this

ive been a huge fan of fm going way back before the big split that led to championship manager and football manager since i started this game ive won the league once and the treble in another season im in my fourth season so its not like im whinging because i cant win but there is clearly something wrong with the matchday engine the most succinct way i can put it is that its like theyve decided brazil vs germany from the last wc is commonplace ill keep 8 straight clean sheets or something like that then get beaten by a promoted side 60 or 75 whats more ive noticed other games in the league finishing 86 and stuff like that since i started counting in three seasons ive seen goalkeepers chipped from the touchline or from inside the defending half 27 times the game needs a lot of work its a winning franchise so all they need to do is fix it but dont spend your money on it until they do they have released a very dodgy product ive never seen an fm release like it just makes the game seem ridiculous even when youre winning and thats not why people play this game right

finally i am starting to fall out of love with this game just too many issues and it appears im not the only one to mention in one review so i will list my biggest bugbears  injuries  like many others each save game has been dominated with injuries fm liverpool fmc liverpool fm custom of course many players get injured but i have rarely managed to field an entire matchday squad without bringing in 23 reserve and youth players this means on average i have about 8 senior players injured 68 weeks is the most common length  training  there just seems to be no improvement on this side of things it is embarrassing that you can only train your whole team as one for example  attacking training there is not one professional team that have all their players do the same group training schemes why would i want the likes of skrtel toure and sakho doing attacking training the majority of the time it is just lazy game designing on top of this there appears to be a bug that a few players in your team are always upset about the high training workload  no matter what you try to fix it  talking to players  again it feels like this is a bit on the weak side you only have the same options available sure you can try to convince players but only with intangible promises  eg promise to bring in high profile players but with no obvious way to figure out if the player you buy is going to appease the player  everything is short term  this is my plan for this season  most clubs have a 3 or 5 year plan you should be able to lay out your plans for your contract entirety  eg have more money in the first year to build a squad that will develop or lay away your transfer kitty for later seasons because the squad you have now will get you promoted etc  teams still wont bid for new players or contract signees  it is very frustrating to buy a kid for the future and have to wait 6 months to loan him out tactics are inflexible  rarely does it work if you want to play a fast short game or a slow direct game this is nothing like real life remember liverpool last season or stoke every season plus they still havent brought back player runs  a huge miss for tactical control the biggest problem matchday  i watch it on 2d to try and avoid some of the bugs but a lot of them still persist the two most common are players not chasing down a loose ball 5 yards away from them and the worst one of allopponent takes a shot kepper makes a save ball comes back into the penalty box keeper watches it for 5 minutes whilst the opponent runs 25 yards to stick it in the back of the netfunny thing is it only happens to your keeper plus the tactics you use dont have a big effect on the game i tested this out by doing the old saverestart cheat against west brom at home tried 442451433 with different player combinations and tacticseach time lost 21 or 20 on the plus side it looks prettier unfortunately as most people point out there is no motivation for miles and the si team to make real improvements each year we will shell out 30 and receive some old rope in return at least now you can play the beta access and get bored of the game before its official release date if you would like to play alternative manager games i recommend fm11 and premier manager 97 those games felt like the developers cared

oh boy where to start the pros the game is so indepth detailed and looks great that at first glance you feel like you are in heaven unfortunately the absolutely ridiculous ai and randomness of the game ruins it for brand new players and seasoned veterans alike very quickly i have played football manager games since the 1990s i have bought every game in this football manager series i have probably tens of thousands of hours of experience playing these and have thoroughly enjoyed every fm yet until this fiasco i have only played this one with two teams man united and sheffield united but the experience has been identical the game is so damn unrealistic that it will suck the life out of you these are actual situations that happened in my season with man united a month into the season i have lost nearly third of my team to long injuries some players cannot put together two games in a row before returning to the injury list not totally out of the question but highly unlikely queens park rangers finished 2nd in the epl in my first season while tottenham and liverpool barely missed relegation i finished 9th and got fired i kept beating the top teams repeatedly while collapsing at home 05 to teams like qpr and swansea i lost 50 to a 9man manchester city after winning the shots 145 and hitting the postcrossbar five times frustrating but not impossible but scenarios like this unfold throughout the season the likes of rooney and mata cannot score regardless of opposition or their position on the field while james wilson bangs out a 30goal campaign you can literally have a guy of van persies stature standing on the 6yd line with an empty net and hit the post over and over again and dont even get me started on these phantom goalies you can be playing against a backup to the backup goalie 2 divisions below yours and fail to score while the opposition sinks 3 behind de gea on three shots i scored 2 or 3 goals from direct free kicks all season and maybe twice from a corner my opponents you got it somewhere around dozens now it might sound like im making excuses and dont know how to manage but as i said i have enjoyed these types of games some 20 years whether i win or lose why because the games have been as fair and realistic as a simulations sports game can be sure there will always be that crazy 75 home win against some world class team but when it happens once every 150 games or so thats pretty okay there will always be that game where an underdog takes you down and leaves you extremely frustrated but guess what it actually happens what doesnt happen are the scenarios i discussed above and after some 150 hours into fm 2015 i feel like i have enough personal experience to call this game total garbage fortunately fm 2013 and fm 2014 are still installed on my computer and still offer limitless hours of fun and entertainment do not waste your money on this game play the older installations and wait until sports interactive gets their crap straight a major major disappointment

pros love the new layout and skin communication with players is better than ever love the new options in transfer and contract negotiations cons way too easy to sign top players and the 48 month payment options are pretty broken they should take more out of your budget for them since at the moment you can spend 100m on a 25m budget match engine is terrible best way to win is by playing like big sam hoof it up to the wingers and have a big man in the middle keepers are also terrible constantly fumbling into the path of oncoming strikers getting caught in posession and passing to the opponent defenders cant mark in the box and miss free headers constantly i would say 34 of all goals come from a cross or a keeper  defender doing something shambolic overall great new features coming at the expense of all the simple things if they fix the match engine then this could be a very good installment currently 410 if patched 910

do not waste your money i spent 35 quid on this game and its the worst one in the entire franchise maybe its just your tactics is coming from most of your lips now wrong unless you are one of the top clubs in the world you will find things such as limited tackling never when its needed ai always get every second ball terrible players can run faster than usain bolt every game has the opposition score a world class goal against you from 40 yards impossible to stop combined with the no tackling your players kicking the ball out whilst trying to pass gks animations forcing them to fail to attempt to save goals rblbs are useless might as well have 9 players the ai is insane always making perfect tackles interceptions from across the pitch because your players try to walk to the ball 90th min goals 5foot 6 players out jumping a 65ft player none existant marking throw in  pass  goal always with the ai no long throw tactic defence every long ball will go to the ai team simple catches have gks in fits gks rushing out and flapping gks code has them try to catch balls on their flight paths only for the ball to go to the first man and they have an empty net players walking through other players without taking the ball no marking from passes 5 defenders in the box one opposition striker he gets the ball and vollys it across goal players on the post wander off as soon as a cornerfreekick is taken players walk away from their markers when the ball is active strikers usually yours 910 times in an offside position insert name didnt mean that goals are happening nearly every game touchline team talk has no effect to anything players do not listen to the tactics shooting less results in a cm player taking the same amount of shots as with it off the graphics are pretty poor ai will kick balls through your players bodies no pressure hoof balls up the field injuries every game leaking goals faster than the titanic leaked water all of the above has come from about an hours worth of play the engine is ablitorated all logic and reason goes out of the window maybe some of the above might relate to my tactics but a huge % are serious flaws within the game

lets be straight forward scroll to the bottom for indept review this year the boys have really taken the game to the next level the game has fixed many issues in the past and almost faultless compared to the past 2014 & 2013 versions things that i really enjoyed  the new interface is very nice but does take time to get used to  match engine y fantastic compared to the past though minor issues with ball bounces lack of roll  the new function to choose the type of manager you are gives the game a more indept feel  frankly the new functions gives you a lot more abilities in managing and structuring your team  tunnel interviews though i personally hate press conferences im lazy the tunnel interviews are a very nice touch things that bug me a bit about the game  the match engines ball bounce is a bit static and does not flow  players opinions seem a lot stronger might just be because i am a new manager  the new interface takes awhile to get used to im still getting my head around it overall my review visuals 810 game engine 7510 gameplay 910 game interface and user friendliness 710 verdict 810 definately recommended ___________ football manager 2015 is the next lineup from its previous stage 2014 equiped with an massive overhaul of the games features and interface this years product was definately highly anticipated so here is my review of the game interface frankly it is definately a fresher look to the game the new interface allows for players to have greater ease and control in getting to different areasdepartments that they need to quickly eg boardroom or squads the overhauled interface tries to bring back memories of the older versions of fm with a updated twist and many users may have a hard time readjusting backto the new interface personally i feel the new interface is a nice idea however does make things a bit complicated in situations but i believe it is simply down to it being new give it a couple daysweeks and you should be comfortable with it verdict 710 game engine with sega taking the game engine to a new level this year this was simply one of the most awaited feature of this years game and guess what it didnt dissapoint with visuals now smoother and insync with the game it is visually astounding when compared to 2014 slicker moves and more cohesion in game less ping pong of 2014 it certaintly is a big upgrade however my criticism would be the ball physics as the bounce does give it a edgy feel with unrealistic and rather static bounce features no matter the angle of the kick verdict 7510 fm2014 was a 5510 gameplay frankly the new features have possible added difficulty to the game which is definately a plus point especially since many users grow tiredbored of the ease of winning in fm 2014 though made slightly tougher it is an interesting addition with new manager formats to choose from finances and training did get a wanted boost and are you as a manager has more opportunities to manipulate work with them to your advantage the gameplay is definately a joy to behold verdict 910 overall look no game can be perfect yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine but for a simulator such as this fm is frankly amazing overall i have to say that football manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all football fanatics if you are a past fm player and have been dissapointed with past versions i honestly beg you to revisit your perspective and try out fm15 please it is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money final verdict 810 [b] hope this helps in making your decision

football manager is not a game until you have loaded football manager up you will not have discovered the wonders that lay inside you start about 900am in the morning you think ill just play a few hours then go get something to eat before you know it the years 2022 and your new youth prospect david moores has scored a hattrick against manchester united real madrid are bidding 40000000 for him but the lads been with you since he was 16 you discovered him in the depths of the crewe academy and you dont want to let him go but the brat wants a new challenge hes telling you that if he doesnt go hes going to start making the dressing room negative then it happens you wake up you realise that it was just a dream david is happy to stay at the club football manager is not a game its a part of your life

ive played fm for many years now and i didnt get into fm 14 due to its issues that had at first and now this also has some issues i did two seasons with fiorentina and scored 100 odd goals the first season and came 2nd the problem is no defence like we conceded 6869 goals and its not tactic related like others have said the teams you play against always wondergoals you cant do anything about and also i duno if its just me but i get a crazy amount of offsides like at least in 10  games both teams 12 offsides also other noteable problems are injuries at least it was realistic at this point when i took charge of arsenal literally in 4 days like 6 injuries to key players some big ones untill patches are out i wouldnt recommend this

time for yet another fm and instead of the usual praise to the sky i find myself struggling for words i played as fc copenhagen within a month i had 8 firstkey team members out with injuries  and not just the common cold mind you  no oh no one with a broken ankel two with damaged tendrons a broken foot etc the shortest injury was 3 months  i feel like im running a community hospital rather than a football club anyways we recover and start winning some matches  except we dont for some odd reason it seems like you can dominate a match to the point where even the opponents fans are rooting for you and yet they still pull a comeback at the end draws galore 1 shot 1 kill so to speak but heck lets review some of the positives as well great realistic scouting system good layout aaaaand yup id recommend you wait purchasing this game until another update has come out do it for you own sake and for ours  the unfortunate souls that purchased this game in good faith that it would be the high standard the game usually is let them feel the heat so they can fix this asap

well this is it the last fm game ill ever buy for full price its not a bad game on its own but charging aaa price for this yearly database update and on top of that shamelessly charging 45 euros for the ingame editor is the last straw for me at least give the preorder buyers a 40% discount and a free ingame editor because your yearly rehash is highly overpriced right now sisega honestly i dont know what i was expecting out of this years game it has been exactly the same for what 56 years now and thats only if you count the annoying interviews and the 3d engine take those away and its the same exact game i played 12 years ago that would not necessarily be a bad thing if they didnt ask for so much money the things the game gets wrong as si would put it include but are not limited to the economy is screwed up still the poor low reputation clubs still ask that you pay more than the players market value yet they set your club with their real world budget and debts they really dont give a damn its all about rich clubs and england as usual because the premier league is the only important one out of 100 leagues 100% of people play in the premier league right the 3d match engine still looks and acts janky as all hell defenders will just stand next to the loose ball while the opposition striker is charging in at full speed the amount of goals scored is currently too high to be remotely realistic i never had a game without scoring only 3 without conceding i beat one team 103 played 15 competitive matches scored 51 and conceded 24 goals so 75 goals in 15 matches if i count the 4 friendlies it gets even more ridiculous the game still has the cheating match engine you lose to a weaker team you know it was set up so you reload the game to test it you lose again maybe 10 reloads later you get a draw but you wont win until you give up the 3d engine and switch to text mode or til you thats right folks until you buy the ingame editor and fix the game   call me a noob and ill just delete your comment and assassinate you when you arent looking ive been playing the game for 12 years and i know my tactics and training setups wouldnt be fair if i didnt say anything positive about this years changes would it now  i like the new interface as for the recommendation if you own the last years game or 2013 2012 2004 dont buy this game the semi updated 3d engine has nothing good to offer and the rest of the game is totally the same the database update is not worth the money until the game goes 75% off if you dont own any fm games but would like to buy one get it at 50% off if youre like me and preordered it go to the steam store and look at games you could have bought instead and cry or keep playing this theyre bound to patch the stupid out of it at some point right right finally here are my scores for the game full price score  510  absolutely not worth 50 of any world famous currency except rubles maybe 50% off  710  if youre shaking and fifa 15 doesnt help you might want to give fm 15 a shot 75% off  810  get it and enjoy it by the time it goes down to 75% off the patches should soften the rough edges youll be getting the best version of this years game at a reasonable price

the match engine is very unrealistic i believe that i stand for most fm players when i say that the best attraction for this game is the tactical ingenuity that we the players can display that wins matches and title yet the tactical changes we make is not reflected during the actual matches the man managing aspect of the game is also overly complicated managers now also have basis stats for our tactican attributes which does not make any sense the biggest problem nonetheless is the tactical and match engine the tactical gameplans are not reflected on the pitch and neither are the attributes of the players the poor match engine results in goal galores that are just too unrealistic

playing fm since 20002001 the series is my favourite of all time across all genres the last 3 years however the game has been getting gradually more of an exercise in ambigious tedium than the magical gaming experience it used to be i appreciate the people at si need to change the game to justify the price tag i just dont know why they insist on breaking the game to do so i can only hope the truly awful new features im looking at you tactics screen will be patched they wont though way too much pride god what ive give for the return of slide bars id also love some explanation no matter how vague for how the 10 million different variables that can affect the outcome of a match actually work im certain si changed the way things like tempo work in game for different tactics without mentioning it or eve updating the tips bar poor form moreover having touchline shouts pressers player interaction 3 teamtalks its too much and its for the most part very very boring as for the me just like with fm14 and 13 at release its broken you would think after 2 poor mes at release si would have the integrity and self respect to deliver this year i remember when si used to release games that didnt need a single patch i think the monopoly si have over the genre has made them complacent its only natural i suppose do not purchase until they have fixed the game maybe in mid march 2 months before the season ends d

after 250 hours of game play its time for a review of fm15 ive been playing these games for a long time since cm9697 since you asked and honestly i think this one is the best yet there were some early problems with the match engine and the inverted wing back role is still broken he stays wide like a normal wing back but the vast majority of the most glaring issues high scoring games regular goalkeeping errors etc have been fixed in sis patches and in good time as well i thought the motion capture animations in the match engine would be a bit of a gimmick but that has turned out to be a welcome addition to the game on an aesthetic level its by no means hyperrealistic to the point where youd be unsure whether youre watching a match on tv or in fm but its a big step up from the hand drawn players of fm14 the realism or lack of isnt a deal breaker for me all i want to see is a realistic simulation of a football match and in fm15 thats what we have for the most part if you watch the matches on comprehensive highlights or higher then you can easily see your tactical decisions playing out in front of you as the game ebbs and flows and for that if nothing else fm15 is the best edition of the football manager series so far setting up a tactic is fairly simple although not fool proof but like any simulation its easy to get in to and difficult to master one thing i have noticed though having spent a lot of time talking to other players and reading some of the reviews here on steam is that this is not a game for players who want to just pick a match day squad and have a handsoff approach to management you will succeed at fm if you make sensible tactical choices always be mindful of balance in your rolesduties and dont use the same approach for every match you play every match will play out differently the most common complaints ive seen from others are regarding injuries and dominating the game yet losing in the dying moments of the match for injuries i dont have these problems as i make sure my players are fully fit use preseason wisely allow your players to ease into it after coming back from holiday then train hard and play lots of friendlies once the season begins lower the intensity of training and give them all individual set ups it takes a while but if you do this your players will be much less prone to injury and will develop faster as well there will be injuries of course but i dont have anywhere near the issues others are having and most of my injury problems are ingame due to my aggressive high pressing style on the domination side of things i will say that more shots and possession does not mean dominance choose your battles wisely if youre the bigger team you can expect your opponent to sit back and hit you on the counter counter this yourself by playing patiently and forcing mistakes your creative players will take care of the rest im not an fm expert but if you take these simple words of advice then you will see for yourself how quickly things will turn around for your team the only thing i cant comment on yet is the ais squad development in the long term as i havent gone far enough into the game yet in past fms this has been a problem but i can already see less instances of the ai spending millions on a player only to let him rot in their reserve team as si say themselves itll never be perfect itll never be finished so as long as you go into the game with that mindset youll get the most out of it i highly rcommend this game for anyone who watches football analytically or who thinks they could do a better job than their favourite teams manager

ive been playing football manager since 2005 this is without a doubt the most frustrating and unrealistic installment purely because of a buggy game simulation sit and watch the 3d matches being played and youll be impressed at some nice new animations but the game being played infront of you will make you want to put your fist through your monitor  strikers miss 90% of 1 on 1 chances  chances that should result in a goal often dont and come around far too often than in real life  defenders that wander all over the place and dont tackle  wingers that seem content to run into defenders rather than crosspass the ball even if a teammate is in tons of space that just names a few needs a patch a big one

waste of time and money fundamentally they have done minor tweaks to minor components of the game and changed the interface but absolutely botched the matchday engine which makes the game almost unplayable despite implementing succesful tactics and qaulity players in defence conceeding from crosses 23 times a game is a regular occurence and seems to be the only means of scoring goals for the opposition and your own team in addition to this injuries occur on average about 12 times a game and it seems that a full strength starting 11 will always be unacheivable because half the squad is injured it is extremely frustrating and unstoppable i bought fm15 for an improvement of fm14 but what i got was a different interface and a circuss of a matchday engine where goals go in at an unrealistic rate and players are playing with bones made out of toothpicks breaking every time they pass a ball stick to 14 as i will really below average effort i hope to see an improvement with a later patch

why does everyone cost so much even kids i found a 17 year old bjorn marinovnever good enough for my team barely good enough for most teams got fed up getting stupid offers back from good clubs for good players so chanced him out of curiosity and here is what i got stats not the worst but hardly great https28postimgorgda7xs1zr1marinovpng clubs valuation utterly stupid https28postimgorgaheq80zelmarinov_negpng and this is every time every player i know the footballing world has inflated valuations for players and fm takes that in to account but for the love of jebus some common sense would be nice also would be nice to buy a game that works and is playable from day 1 the day you buy it rather that having to wait till near jebus bday before its playable heres an ideafar out there but worth a try find someone or more than one in the office that plays the damn game get them to try it out before you have the audacity to charge people for it so that when you do charge for beta its only minor fixes then when you sell the full game it ing works remember when you could hand over your money and in return get a fully working enjoyable game i remember regardless i will never buy this game again stupidly thought this year would be better like i did last year and the year beforebasically same  every yearrant over

dont get me wrong i love football manager the layout is great and everything runs smoother than previous iterations that is great as i always felt it was a minor problem however why in seven hells is every decent youth player worth from 200k to around 2 million but when you try to purchase them for maybe 3 million 4 million the club asks for something ridiculous upwards of 25 million seriously the best i can do is constantly buy old players who wont be ridiculously over priced timo werner for example i can buy lionel messi for just under his jaw dropping price tag of 62 million lets be realistic here abromovich would be laughing if mourinho wanted that player and was asking him for that amount of money seriously this is meant to be the most realistic football management simulation sort it out please oh and just as a final note i really dont find it realistic if 7 of my first team get injured in a single match for 5 months each does anyone know when the next update is

this has to be this worst fm for a long time i cant seem to get into it like the others and match engine doesnt seem as good ive no idea why the devs felt the need to change the match engine again because they changed it in fm 14 and that was bugged on release as well but alot better than in this version when players are running with the ball its as though they are running in thick mud cos they are so slow goalkeepers are broken they cant seem to save anything the ui is bad as well no idea why they felt the need to change it selecting your team line up now requires more clicks and takes longer cos of the changes i really hope the devs fix the issues but overall this game is a disappointment over previous fm games

do not buy this game check my games list you will see that i once loved fm games not anymore and never again will i buy one this is the type of unfinished game that steam need to ban from being sold certain key components dont even work at all a small example is that there are no penalties from handballs right now the game fails in every way it could the me is a poor imitation of a crossing and set pieces simulator not a football simulator it is worse than the last three years versions upon release and i can assure you that they all had bugs and issues not this many or this bad if you really need more just go to the forums and read not many that will claim this game is anywhere near in a playable state maybe in 78 months from the time i write this si will have released a patch that makes it something like a game oh if that wasnt enough beware si and sega are not cooperating and are in fact sending customers with issues back and forth between them not me but check forum if you care also be aware that si are deleting the vast majority of negative posts claiming it will affect the way our customers play the game which is of course true they wouldnt play it because they would know whats wrong with it

i wouldnt recommend buying this game until a few patches are released the release version is full of bugs especially the match engine that makes it almost unplayable i mean sure you can play it but you just have to cringe at all the goals scored from obvious match engine bugs at this point 50% of goals are scored from crosses on the wing that your defenders just dont contest 30% scored from set pieces 10% scored on missplaced backpasses to the keeper and 10% for the rest the defense and goalie are so terrible most matches end with 4 goals scored if you want to win just make sure you have wingers who like to hug the touchline and cross the ball instead of cutting inside should have expected it really it is the first time i buy fm right on the release date

its decent installment again but nothing much is new i paid 35 bucks for this and just upgraded from the beta to the full game and i dont notice a single difference everything still is as shady as in the beta  this just wont stand it means theyve probably had this game ready for ages since the changes are just graphical mostly and want to hussle us as much as they can of course the engine  card  injury system is messed up on launch as usual too ffs why do i keep falling for their scummy tricks i cant recommend anyone buying this now get it for 1520 bucks and after a few patches and maybe then its a decent update had to choose thumbsdown until the state of the game changes then my review might change too edit just got a crash dump error for the second time as well im done with this till they patch it back to fm14 it is sigh  edit 2 the only thing fixed are the crash dumps i no longer get crashes but the match engine is still so random and terrible that i dont even want to play no more edit 3 20122014 almost winter and this game is still a mess you can lose to the number 18 of the league with your best eleven and then 3 days later win against a stronger opponent with your bsquad for no reason at all si should be ashamed of themselves

im a fifa manager guy however as it has been discontinued i had to move to football manager a friend taught me the ropes and ive been playing for a while i played with liverpool ac milan bayer leverkusen and atltico madrid no game has gone to midseason i studied researched and spent a lot of time talking with friends about this game i wish i hadnt this is just the worst manager game ive ever played for a simple reason nothing you do matters i bought marco reus and alex oxdalechamberlain to play on the wings might as well have kept the money for myself and used emile heskey and djimi traor there the most skilled player cannot dribble past the worst defender the best crosser of the ball cannot beat the first man the tallest and best header cannot score 3 goals a season from crosses every team play the exact same way and most goals come from the same three things shots from outside the box defensive mistakes and freekicks in upwards of 300 hours spent in the game i dont think i saw a single goal from a corner however three times i saw a goalkeeper handle the ball outside the box and get booked and two of those freekicks resulted in goals players are so unbelievably stupid that its annoying steven gerrard to take a free kick on the edge of the box you think hes going for goal no hes going to pass it back to the left back who will then try to dribble and lose it you think asmir begovic is a good goalkeeper well hes not above handling the ball outside of the box when trying to boot it upfield id always been told that football manager was all about the tactics and that it is the hardest thing to manage well it is hard specially because no matter how you set your team up to play they will always play the same way you can try to get the best passers of the game but they will misplace at least 30% of their 6 yard passes this is so frustrating im at a loss for words injuries well hows this for a list before the third match of the season i had the following players injured steven gerrard jordan henderson alex oxdalechamberlain alberto moreno john flanagan marco reus adam lallana daniel sturridge asmir begovic and mario balotelli thats before the third match all of those players bar lallana and reus who are injured at the start of the season got injured during pre season seriously unless this game is heavily patched to fix everything thats not just wrong but plain dumb ill be forced to stop playing a genre i really enjoy because ea were not competent enough to keep fifa manager going and because sega apparently have no clue what a football match looks like ill wait and see but i will not hope for much

people often send me messages asking why i am playing this game so i thought i would post a review to explain why i will first point out that i have a strong interest in football i wouldnt say i watch the matches but i am always reading news stories online and am up to speed with the majority of world football headlines i will also say i am not a massive fan of the fifa series of games produced by ea they seem to have a very immature audience whenever i have tried to play them online and that is something which puts me of immediately football manager the series puts you in the office of a football manager shocker huh you take on all the jobs that a football manager does from setting up tactics to training sessions all the way to signing new players for your team personally i find myself getting very immersed in this game there is something really special about taking a team from one of the lower leagues all the way up to being the best team in the world once you pass the first couple of seasons the players which are around today all start to retire move onto different teams etc this is when the game really begins the game will create computer generated random players these are called regens how good these regens are depends on a number of things but mostly the training and youth facilities you have at your club there is nothing more satisfying in the this game than finding a young 17 year old unknown kid and training and developing him into a worldclass footballer people may laugh or snarf at this game but if you enjoy football and want to find yourself a massive addictive time sync then football manager is the game for you

instead of getting the core of the game right tactics match engine we get yet another load of new press interactions that nobody cares about and even more dumb talks with players and teams sure you can get your assistants to do it but some players actually likes talkes to press and staff as long as its not repetitive and actually has an impact nevertheless the real problem is with the match engine results like 3 to 5 or 4 to 4 are common the goalkeeper stays on his line for every cross and the movements the players make in the engine are laughable the crowd looks like a bunch of inflatable dolls in the stand and just like previous x versions there is hardly any atmosphere in terms of sound from the crowds where have the good old sack the boss chants gone or why cant the crowd whistle or boo at the ref for that crippled engine we get the amazing gift of hot dog stands outside the stadium wow thanks for getting your priorities straight si last time i bought the game since 9899 time for a decent competitor

thank god i only paid 5 for this prasie the lord for gifts cards when playing fm13 i thought that these games were head and shoulders above any other football game in terms of the imersiveness and the elevel of realism but the last two games since then have been truly discusting i dont care about the graphics thats not what the game is about but the actual realism of the match engine is poor what is going on with the goalkeepers this year about 1015 of my conceded goals have come directly from rebounds from frankly rediculous saves from the keep he will just parry the ball away from the most tame shot imaginable and stand there for about a year until the follow up from the opposition striker rolls it in then he dives injuries are something which many people are complaining about i dont feel like my tactical changes have any efect on the game match stats mean nothing this is a real shame because i have a lot of time for si but im losing faith by the day i feel like some things happen on the game just to make you more addicted becasue lets be honest its more addictive when your not winnimg because you cant put the game down until you have sorted it and why do you have a sudden drop in form ever jan or feb every team has a bad patch but i aloong with many other players have unexplained drops in form where nothing you do can halt the slide i could go on for hours but i cant be bothered to give anymore feed back because i dont think it makes any differenc so if this review does nothing more than let me take my anger out on it then so be it

this game is really atrociously bad tactics are stupid the players are stupid and what can you say about the matchengine is just action after reaction after reaction  ask your team to tackle a player hard  get sent off after 2 min  go 2 up  get 2 pegged back  then score 3 2  or go 2 down  peg 2 back  then lose 32  teamtalk press conferences  whats the point of it all seriously  i want my money back  the last good fm was also the first one  2005 10 years of garbage and its just keeps getting worse by every year  i will never buy fm again

like every previous football manager games i preordered fm15 just to play beta i have to say this year there are way more bugs then every other years i played 50 hours in the first 3 days of the release of the beta version and i spotted about 10 problems because this is my favourite game i just keep playing and identify bugs in the bugs forum so my favourite game can be fixed yet i waited after two updates the game is still not fixed bugs that are still not fixed  after stadium expansion plan got cancelled the finishing date still highlight on the calendar  rooney get unhappy because pre season training start too early even though it is nearly december  defenders with at least 15 pace and 15 acceleration chase down the ball that has passed the defenders line ridiculously slow this is the most frustrating bug how can phil jones or jonny evans or rafael chase down a ball so so so slow it is pretty much slower than others walking the opponent end up getting ball easily since the defenders cant even get the ball with 50 metres head start throughout the 3 seasons ive seen this occurred 20 times so im quitting until it is fixed  setpiece marking is completely broken i set pretty much all my players to defend 3 form wall and 7 markers against 5 opponent yet 3 out of 5 opponents are completely unmarked and freely roaming around on the side of my wall  team selection layout maybe a minor issue but it can be annoying if you have a big squad or you want to pick someone in the youth team there used to be a sub slots column next to starting formationline up now it it gone you now have to drag a player from the players list to the substitute slots on the same list picking substitute has never been harder in my life  budget adjustment in my first season at manutd i can adjust the transfer budget to zero so i can have 36 mil per week for wage budget the second season i adjust it all the way to wage budget but i can only get 3 mil per week wage budget so that means my minimum transfer budget is 60 mil im paying players 3 mil wage per week so whats the point of having maximum 3 mil for wage budget and 60 mil for transfer budget why cant i have all my transfer budget all my wage budget  there are many more i have posted all the bugs ive spotted on the bugs forum but all i get is pissy tone replies or thread closed for lacking evidence they expect me to download this thing so i can post the game file on the server for them and ive try installing it on my mac countless of time it failed to install not to mention it is sponsored by mackeeper a freaking mac virus i tried to posted screenshot on the forum it never works they recommended this other software which has 2 weeks trial for free do i have to pay to help them identify the bugs i tried upload so videos of the bugs so my thread doesnt get close down and i get all these pissy replies since there server doesnt work i upload the game file on a file hosting website they still expect me to upload it on a server that never works on my mac mostly unappreciated replies when im trying to help them occasionally i get a nice reply but i am very unhappy with the game i save up my pocket money to preorder it paypal converted the money to profit them i got charged by banks with overdrawn fee and i get a game full of rubbish

while i have loved the fm series since its inception this is the worst version i have played yes the menu system has been changed and will take a while to get used to ut just feels cluncky and the scouting system has changed drematically and has problems as i scouted ross barkley managing swansea and got back this player would not be a worth while signing the worst thing about this game is whatever decideds the score currently i am 15 games into the season and so far the best result for any team away is a draw burnley v chelsea 11 all the other matches have been home wins for the respected teams and some strange results qpr beating arsnel 63 my results away have been awful and at home frakley strange h v everton 52 w a v villa 40 l a v leicester 70 l h v man city 21 w h v man utd 10 w a v tot 42 l h v liverpool 30 w a v burnley 20 l a v chelsea 82 l a v west ham 60 l h v arsenal 31 w h v west brom 62 w a v southhampton 31 l h v qpr 40 w a v sunderland 10 l its stupid everyone is near enough on the same popints its coming down to goal difference this has nothing to do with tactics or team moral there is a major bug in the system

i love the game very much however there are always some concerns these are all game play issues 1 a few players ratings messi is 20 everything as usual but he didnt have a great last season like he usualy does some players are quite underrated such as di maria and a few atletico madrid players ronaldo has 15 acceleration not sure how that works 2 some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainablenot sure if its a bug or not sometimes the defenders just headspass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it 3 when players dribble they run into teamates far too often which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life 4 this is a very irritating one players misses 1v1s far too much if they have 45 1v1 chances theyll manage to score one this is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply dont miss all those chances you could say that they are having a bad game but its happening consistantly throughout the season also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance but our players just blast it strait at their keepers 5 final one so far players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target so far i havnt seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition please could you fix these issues i would be forever greatful

in every game 13 player gets injured this game kicks your nut sacks as long till you want to play a totally different game long winning streaks followed by long losing streaks even the league bottom dwellers hits you with 60 too many goals 45 on average horrible execution tackles inside penalty areas almost never leads to a penalty shot but penalties come from errors which you cannot even see fm15beta is faulty as hell good job si ok this is beta but it has to be a totally different game on next friday when the official release date is best goal  my goalie was called by referee goalie walked there and received an yellow card then my goalie started jogging towards his work place and meanwhile the opponent gave their corner kick and scored an empty netter rather play fm13 beyond earth and this prepurchased and regret both never again a prepurchase not even one

i want to play this game i like fantasy games but everytime i start it up i remember that half my team will be injured within the first 3 months that no matter what i do consistency is not possible and my team will fail to perform and i will fail to have any real impact on that despite the rediculas sometimes over lapping micromanaging aspects that are both too specific and too general example exploit the flanks doesnt mean exploit the flanks more it means only exploit the flanks unless you select other options in which that ratio cant be controlled example you can have multiple coaches for multiple traits and skills but can only have one practice type per day you can try to teach a player a new move or position and its up to the player if hes compatable let alone compitent you will train and trade and chances are players wont want to come to your club in which case the conversational options are minimal repetative and nonimpactful oh and did i mention that some of the user interface is completely bugged and i mean completely try organizing your custom view and watch as some of your options do not appear you want to sort by position sure wait then why does it sort by ability when i click position to suggest this game would be to encourage this type of lack luster game developing that is become the norm im not saying you cant make money but just publish a game every other year and charge us 100$ for something you can be proud of instead of dusting off and polishing the same game with improved data

have been playing fm since 2012 so i am no way a newbie to this game my 2 cents so far 1 too many bugs in match engine laggy lousy ui gameplay is not realistic at all amount of long shots unrealistic angles number of goals ball physics everything is a big letdown 2 add to that licensing issues fm should state in bold that fm 2015 does not have licence for players faces team logosjerseys  this was shambolic and adds one more level of unrealism i could go on rambling about it  in short fm 2015 disappoints me every level practically a downgrade from fm 2014

overall this year was a disappointment for me first i dont like the dark skin but well its just my taste injuries everyone mentions about it i think its not just the number of players injured which is the problem the problem is the duration of those injuries while playing with corinthians at some point i had 7 players out for 56 months with broken legs all happened during matches and i play this game at a good level for 6 years i know how to reduce them it is just broken players are just  just 3 weeks after some jackass signs a new contract he becomes unhappy with his contract and asking for a new one if a player is playing well he becomes unhappy in any case he wants more salary a new challenge or is flattered by interest of a bigger club player is on international duty for 40 days and he becomes unhappy for not being in the first team same goes with injured players i have a squad of 24 players 21 of them are on international duty and i have a semi final match game is simply absurdly ed up you cant make any alterations on your fixture you cant interact with the fa or your club board for most cases after all i could write down a 50page list on things that are  in the game i wont i just want to tell everyone who considers buying the game i feel like they intentionally made it so  so that we will be forced to buy the ingame editor there is no way you can play this game unless you buy the ingame editor keep it in mind

i was really looking forward to the latest edition of football manager i have been buying them since 2007 this is easily the worst football manager for a long time the match engine underpins this there are a number of issues with it the first is the goals per game there have been numerous occasions where you will go into half time with a score at 33 or more an example of this was when i was playing as newcastle and in a game against liverpool i was 42 up at half time only to eventually loose the game 85 this seems to happen all the time the second is the goalkeepers i have seen some absolutely blinding saves where a goalkeeper will jump from one end of the goal all the way to the other and still hold the ball the next minute a shot from 30 yards will go right down his throat and he seems to jump out the way of it the goal kicks are often very strange i have often been in the situation where the keeper will simply pass it to the opposition striker who simply puts the ball in the net extremely frustrating as you can imagine in addition to this is if a goal keeper makes a save but doesnt hold onto the ball he seems to forget all about it your defenders will also have no interest in it the only person who is will be an opposition player who will run 45 yards for a simple tap in but it only ever seems to be against you it can be comical at times where the defenders are turning on the spot looking in all directions the goalkeeper wandering around the six yard box and a striker skipping through and tapping it in general mistakes with the engine involve every other position as well if youre thinking of getting this game dont wait until they fix it or steer clear for good

it is a new game with a new and very easy to use interface imo together with the gameplay fm15 looks amazing on the outside i know this is just a beta and i have only played a few hours on this game i have encountered problems which i dont know whether i am terrible at managing arsenal or that the bugs are really messing me up 1 lots and lots of own goals it happened that calum chambers scored a hatrick of own goals against qpr which ultimately lost me the game 2 injuries injuries everywhere at least all my players have been injured once since i have been in charge 4months and it is getting ridiculous debuchy was injured for 3 months then i played him once he got fit and got injured again for another 2 it is getting out of hand 3 goalkeepers where do i begin goalkeepers do the craziest  in the entire world sometimes it can be funny and other times its frustrating as fwuak it is also not my own gk aswell when i check other games replay the goalies can be proper sorry other than those issues this game has been great for me i absolutely love the tactics menu the new scouting system and more player interaction even though this game does have its issues it should not be discouraged to play it i am sure these issues are being brought up by si and they are trying to fix it personally even with its bugs it is a better and more challenging game than fm14 710 peace <3 edit si officialy released a patch fixing issues with the goalkeepers and the own goals <3 si

the game is fine in the long term but the buggy match engine and the tons of injuries are so annoying my goalkeeper makes a great save and parries it you would think he would want to get that ball as soon as possible nope he takes forever to get up leaving the opposistion to just tap it in my wingers keep cutting inside then howling it into row z at least 5 times a match i have my highlights set to key so when i see memphis depay cut inside i get all pumped up and then nope he kicks it out of the stadium the injuries are also annoying sure its realistic but every pre season i end up with at least 5 key players getting injured before the opening match of the season it gets better as the season goes along and i know its because of low match fitness in pre season but its stupid this needs to be fixed there are some positives though the scouting and coaching is a lot better than in previous fms and the transfers are also realistic the only problem with the transfers is that all the youth players want the same deal and they wont budge at all unless i give them 20k a week i would recommend this game to a first time fm player but not if you have previous fms just stick to them and not buy this buggy game

having played many fm games over the years i didnt think that the match end could become more painful to watch seeing your own players move out of the way of the ball has been in the game for ages and its really time this kind of nonsense was fixed watching a match is like pulling teeth as your players walk to tackle move out of their way and let the opposition clean through on goal had this not cost 17 i would never have bought it because no fm game is worth 30 the game has become so bloated that it has forgotten its core values of what made fm such a great

let me start this by saying i have been playing fm games for a few years now and have thoroughly enjoyed them this is the first year that it has disappointed me so much that i actually tried to lobby to get my money back from steam rather than trust the patch system to right the ship steam obviously flat out refused to help me which i guess its written in the rules and steam lacks any sort of heart for its customers so that was a wasted effort my main irritation is the injuries it seems some of you experience the injury issue and some dont working with sounders fc within two friendlies and a league game i lost obafemi martins brad evans and pineda to injuries during the match 4 days later in what i put in as light training i lost chad barrett for 4 months and ozzie alonso for 3 months those injuries crippled my team for a grand total of 5 months all within the span of a week in my entire life of ever watching soccerfootball i have never ever seen this happen this is supposed to be the most realistic league simulator in all of gaming right well not anymore the other glaring issue is whicher agorathim they use for what i call the fair shake factor in my first friendly i had the seattle sounders with mostly starting level players going up against a regional team semi pro at best and i got smashed 4 to 1 sounders fc almost never get beat especially to teams from what i would consider a beer league team this is terrible they broke football manager 2015 as far as i can tell its not even fun

ive been playing football manager since 9798 game and feel this is probably the worst football manager yet the excessive amount of goals makes the game incredibly unrealistic injuries seem to happen mainly to key players and nobody else the revamped graphics is pretty disappointing and the new skin is harder to use i wish i had bought this as a cd so i could take it back to the shop the games of late have all had at least one small issue such as the amount of times players hit the post in fm2013 but this version seems to have more than ever

well for me it just isnt fun fm lost its fun for me from around fm10  ie it just became too realistic  i think i stopped at fm11 i came back for fm14 on sale and thought it was okay my main problem is that even by cheating you cant win unless you are lucky enough to figure out ongoing tactics  which is kind of tedious and a game killer for me so by using the ingame editor and magically transferring players like messi ronaldo bale ramos pique t silva vidal etc to man utd  dont expect to go play the next game and walk all over the opposition  in fact i gave up when i was being hammered 72 by aston villa  ive been replaying the aston villa game for hours to try to at least draw with them  its not fun opposing ai players have a frustrating ability to just seem faster and more skillful than any player your team has  so its like a player like ronaldo or messi play worse  basically aston villa are playing like they have inherited all of the skills of my team  like it is a glitchbug  aston villa can run up the wing and cross the ball and score nobody touches the ball the winger just runs up the touchline and fires the ball into the back of the net from the wing  they can even do that twice in a game aston villa are scoring astonishing world class goals messi ronaldo bale etc are struggling to play at sunday league level i will buy the fact that you have to somehow find a tactic that works  but how the hell does this affect ronaldos etc ability to run with the ball theres just no fun in magically transferring players to your team and they all of a sudden dont have a clue how to play football they react slower  to me it is like they are hindered by something yet its fair to say other people will claim that they could magically transfer great players to their team and just win 10  0 every game so for me the game is potentially only fun if you prefer the tactics of football and can work out the combinations long gone are the days of the older fms or cms when you literally could buy the best players in the world and just destroy everything in your path without too much thought about tactics i think i will struggle to continue playing this game because replaying aston villa for hours in reallife just to at least draw with them is kind of pointless

its football manager 2014 with a new skin or is it fm 2013 with the bugs ironed out i paid good money for 2015 and apart from a few gui tweaks and slightly improved match engine i can see not a lot a difference it looks to me like the developers have sat on their hands for 364 days and spend 1 day skinning the old 2014 and then releasing it no doubt like in 2014 we will have a number of bugs that are never ironed out how about penalty taking in 2014  the game would never continue i do not thing they have listened to the football manager community and released a hashed up version and then booked thier holidays for another year poor

first days play there is a lot of familiarity here and also a lot of new learnings the ui has been revamped giving more of a taskbar feel and for me not a bad layout at all i can get to more frequent places in game with one or two clicks now rather than 3 or 4 which is appreciated takes a little getting used to in finding your way around but that was expected im playing with england being playable and every other country viewable filters include all regions top league players coming it at about 130000 some nice new features include the touchline shouts which im still looking at the effects but generally seem to be working ok some tweaks with the scouting and man management options too which i like a lot the engine itself is different enough to distinguish itself from previous games yet isnt a true evolvement more upgrade than paradigm shift visuals have been upgraded all over i really like the tactic options feels more rounded now lots of nice shortcuts very happy with the purchase and looking forward to having long careers

nope i love fm since it came out many many years ago but this version makes me angry too many shots up to 50 per match too many posts hitten i got 7 in one match bizarre results arsenal  qpr 95 ie its almost impossible to figure out if you are bad or if it is just the system randomizing too much reserve players with a reserve contract harassing cause they dont play nope i am really disappointed

why dont i ever take notice of all the negative reviews i should have learned from 2013 and 2014 which i put hours into that without any competition for decent football manager games sports interactive were just going to polish a turd and throw it out as new i wont go into my injury count after 3 games as most people already make mention to the absurd number of injuries now granted i havent put a lot into this game well 30 of my hard earned cash was more than enough but do i really need to put any more time in than i have it is awful the same absolute crap they sold last year it looks a complete mess it plays like a complete mess and the old random effect seems to be back with regards to results this game is like taking two dice rolling them and giving scores to each team your tactics mean nothing your squad of players mean nothing you can say this review is based on only 12 hours of gameplay and youd be right but if you add that to the hours sunk into 2014 which is pretty much the same and the fact ive played football manager since its championship manager days i do not need to put more hours into seeing this game fall on its  over and over like the last 2 seasons the game has become over complicated to the point that instead of your knowledge of football being tested its your patience that this game tests with its absolute random results results like elche 3 barcelona 0 followed by barcelona 5 atletico 0 and we round off the 3 matches with barcelona 0 real madrid 7  er yeah the same players that got me a 50 win also lost to a nothing team by 3 and then destroyed by real madrid even if i had no tactical knowledge whatsoever in football barcelona shipping 10 goals in 2 games whilst scoring 5 in another is just absolute horse st in real life id have to put messi in goal and neymar on the bench to ship 10 as barca i do prefer to start in the lower leagues mind you however seeing those results i dont think i like the idea of being hammered 10 or 110 every game so stopped short of starting an actual longterm game i have no doubt there will be players saying you just dont know what youre doing to which ill just get in first with yes i do  saved you time typing your tired and ill informed response i have a very good knowledge of footballing tactics training regimes and how good a player should be in certain positions based on stats however this game does not reflect any of that i also know that too many new players can cause issues with morale and so forth i understand an over heavy training regime could effect the players performance i know that a 433 doesnt work in any top division i know that introducing new players slowly to the team is sometimes better than throwing them in with a 90 minute debut ive read tips pages ive read faqs ive been playing the series and its predecessor since 1992 and usually have a great time taking smaller clubs over and with time building them into bigger clubs

i played fm2012 from its release until recently when i purchased fm2015 i played a friends fm2013 and again 2014  but there wasnt a big enough reason for me to buy the new games as i was still enjoying 2012 i decided this year to buy the new fm2015 new features player updates great match engine etc what could go wrong lots the match engine is pathetic thats the only word for it heres why keepers constantly spill the ball onto opposition players midfield just stand off and stand off no tackles made just run up stop watch the player run past regardless of what tactics you use ie close down more harder tackling etc the amount of goals conceded by corners or long range wondergoals is a joke im in the scottish premiership right now theres no way my team should be conceding the types of goals they have been whats worse  for some reason when i turned the match engine off and went back to the classic only commentary mode  these ridiculous goals stopped i went the next season undefeated im now persevering in my 4th season with my team having 60% possession 30 shots 8 on target lost 31 to a team with 10s & 11s finishing wtf if i still had my old laptop id look for a player update on fm2012 and stick with that i feel as though this game and its engine is really flawed going from beating liverpool with celtic 40 away from home and then losing 30 to st mirren after dominating the game yeah ok

the games have been getting worse since 2012 this game is no fun to play at all and is incredibly frustrating as most people have mentioned its buggy the new menu system works for some things quick access to teams training etc but is terrible in others such as the team selection covered in colours and you have no idea how to even pick a team which results in a steep unnessesary learning curve then comes the matches almost every game goes one of 4 ways you scrape a windraw you dominate and go 23 goals up and end up loosing somehow you thump a team 3 or 40 or you get thumped yourself it doesnt seem to matter if your opposition is better or worse than you those are the outcomes mostly you will scrape a drawwin to make it worse you can thump a team better than you then get smashed by a team worse than you the next week the team talks are basically the same and as poor as the last couple of years but with an apparantly random outcome of mood in your players until you get repuation which frankly is impossible the same goes for press confrences which have mostly been poor and a time waster slowing the game down and having a completely unknown outcome now you have to deal with the press directly before or after a game slowing it further just give it to your assitant manager even though they will say crazy things like arsenal will win the league when your playing as tottenham it may boil down to having to choose you managerial type rpg style which is the worst idea they have ever had it feels like cheating by giving yourself the highest stats but that is the only way to stand a chance i dont want to think about my inner workings as a managerhead coach i just want to play the game it may also come down to learning how your interactions affect the game this to me is unrealistic and learing how to play a game isnt the same as becoming a better real life manager the one and only positive is the new scouting system where you need a good couple of weeksmonths to get a full picture of the players though you still need to make sure your scouts are half decent otherwise youll waste a lot of time and money its just annoyingly poor i havent even mentined the bugs as there well covered by other reviews ive played the game since the days of championship manager but this is terrible frustrating and worst of all its not fun dont waste your money

sports interactive has taken a long look at their primary tactical setup and made changes to make it more relatable to their audience and also more analogous to the influence that reallife managers are able to exert as long as they keep pulling tricks like this football manager is a series that will remain evergreen but the biggest improvement to this game has got to be the match engine year after year were used to the buggy disappointing experience especially for us 3d users but from what ive seen out of my first play currently 18 games into my season excluding friendles i havent seen 1 bug maybe im lucky but for a beta thats impressive its much more fluid and all of the new animations that have been added has really added to the realism the new interface has got to be the biggest plus aswell alot more cleaner kinda looks like a andriod tablet set up with the left hand bar down the side and even when youre scrolling down youre squad list or scout list it feels alot more optimized the game has improved big time on processing speeds im running the same size database with the same leagues as before england scotland spain brazil portugal mls france and germany and the rest of the leagues on view only with a player base of 92000 which doesnt struggle which was one of the down points of fm14 although it was fast there was sometimes youd be going to youre browser while you were waiting theyve also added a new feature where you can choose youre licence and past playing experience which i found to be pretty amazing although i havent fully understood it yet but ill be sure to update this when i do i havent tried classic mode as of yet but looking foward to having a go at it hopefully theyve improved it this year with less clutter and more stats all in all i have to give this game a 910 which is pretty damn impressive for a beta one last thing we still have leaderboards was getting scared as i was seeing tons of ruhmours about it not being in this years version but they were proved wrong hopefully workshop comes back this year too i will be updating this once the offical release on novemember the 7th

i really love this series of games and have played fm since the 2009 edition this time they have gone a step down in my opinion the new layout is okay the interface bar on the left side instead of the top is a great new thing but from there on its just worse to be honost the tactic section is clumsy and very few things are better and alot of things are worse besides from that it seems like the match engine is way worse too normally there would be some sense of stability but now i can play as man city and win 80 against sportingpor and then lose againt some 3rd division team 36 in the next match theres an unbelieveable amount of injuries which is so damn frustrating the search engine has got a makeover that is for the better although i seem to have a problem finding young players from outside europe without making the leagues playable all in all a turn for the worse but most of the problems could be solved with some updates and maybe a choice to chose the old tactics interface please at this very moment i would not recommend it but as mentioned it could be very recommendable if some fixes come soon over and out christian bang

there is certainly a lot more going on in this years iteration of fm  certain elements have been changed massively from the fm14 look whilst some have received only a mild tweaking this tends to be the case nearly every year and dont always result in an improved product the changes made this year have largely been pleasing although in particular i am not a fan of the new tactics board it seems like the information i need is still there but it is hidden behind extra menus and mouse clicks generally creating what feels to me like an inefficient system when compared to fm14 the gameplay has remained largely the same and is familiar to anyone who has spent time with the series the engine seems to have been improved in some areas and regressed in others again mirroring previous versions of the game there seem to be more goals going in more goals from crosses and set pieces and more defensive errors the game also seems harder and learns an inflexible managers tactics rather quickly i only use the 2d classic view so cant comment on the 3d match engine i have never used it or had any interest in it fundamentally its still great fun to build and develop a team to argue with other managers and to lead your club to glory or glourious defeat i would definitely recommend this to anyone with more than a passing interest in the franchise and it represents a solid return on investment in terms of new features and gameplay hours
recommended
this game is probably the worst ever made the skin is confusing they havent added any new useful options in the game but worst of all the game engine i have never ever ever experienced such a completely useless game engine during a match it doesnt matter who you play or whether you play defensive or offensive the result will always be that the will score at least 2 against you and sometimes you score a lot of goals and sometimes you only score once futhermore your players will be injured half of the time even when youre on a roll and havent lost 5 games in a row your team will loose to a team in the bottom so much wrong with this game that they really have to make a lot of updates and quickly even if youre a fan of the series this game is a total catastrophy play fm 14 13 or 12 instead

worst 2999 ive spent on a game this is my first review which will probably show but i felt i had to warn people i was really looking forward to getting this game and thought it looked amazing when i first started playing it the stadia and player animation are great and the feel of the prematch game itself is good training and scouting are easy to manage as is the creation of friendly matches board and player interaction is fine and i particularly like how whole team chats work if only i could say the same for the rest of it i am currently half way through my fourth season and am so frustrated with the game ive given it a reasonably good chance check my hours played not as many as others granted but still quite a bit considering the flaws in the game and here i am sitting as usual with half my first team medium or long term injured ive hired better physios tweaked training to ensure that it wasnt too strenuous and ensured that my coaches were well matched to training routines still its happening ive checked others reviews and plenty of people are finding the same si need to resolve this the game is completely unrealistic in this area and its spoiling it for myself and others who have sadly paid good money for the pleasure of playing it the other big fault is the performance of goalies when the match engine is running i mean a 23 cap goalie with 1720 for one on ones standing with hands on hips with messi bursting into the penalty box goalies with high stats for jumping reach and agility unable to reach a chest height shot from a marauding opposition defender a new update came in today and i was hoping at least one of these two problems would be sorted i played four matches against mediocre sides 12 04 10 woohoo and 03 im no fm tactical expert but im not by any means a noob or a rookie ive been playing si football management games each year since championship manager 93 yep 1993 <grabs flat cap pipe and slippers> have in past games won plenty of back to back promotions won european trophies and plenty of league championships i buy players specifically to fit my systems and use their info to adjust strategies my understanding of tactics cant be that bad of all the 20 odd si games in the original cm fm series that ive played this one is the most inconsistent and most frustrating of all of them in the four matches played today in addition to the 6 long mid term injured first team players out i had injuries as follows game 1  cm and wb both out 911 days game 2  no injuries game 3  cm cd and lone striker all out between 911 days and 3 weeks each game 4  wb out 6 days oh and a training injury to my 2nd best wb  out for 2 weeks from half way between game 3 and game 4 will probably have wait until fm 2016 before these flaws are resolved people have been raising them on forums for months now and nothing has been done however sis attention will most likely be firmly on thinking on the next game in the series unlikely that anyone from si will read this but if they do  remember that people have paid for this game guys im pretty sure that from what i remember cm and fm games used to be delayed until the match engine was just right that was worth it this time its been comparatively all looks and no substance which is a real shame for now im going back to playing champ manager 9394 on my old amiga anyone remember them 18 players called tadeusz kruszinski and only english leagues available but at least it had a match engine that worked

762015 do not buy this game as the patches have still not sorted the bugs ive bought every fm and cm for as long as i can remember but i waited until recently to purchase fm15 because of the reports of the large amount of goals that are being scored in peoples games as well as the constant injuries read the si forums i bought the game which also had the new patch so i was hopeful of these bugs being sorted i wouldnt say i experienced a great deal of goals in my game although i do play very defensive i did however find that players were getting injured all of the time during matches and during training it ended up that i was making substitutions in the first half of most matches half the team will take knocks and 2 or 3 players on average will have to leave the field due to injury the last straw came in the champions league when i had done all substitutions due to injuries  not knocks and then my keeper and right back got knocks my keeper would not move due to the injury and a goal was scored i ended the game with 9 men i feel really bad for the people who bought the game full price

i have had football manager since 2010 enjoyed playing iit greatly for years i enjoyed the ability to micromanage the little things in the game mainly the sliders if my team was getting scored on a great deal move thedefensive line slider back a few notches of which i had twenty a few years ago they decided to do away with the sliders but keep them optional to simplify the game fine i still have them the last few years completly gone and its obvious to anyone who plays the game that the system is exactly the same the player and team instructions are still moving sliders in the background so i am at the point where i am just not interested in the game anymore i am sure there are people out there that like to tinker and micromanage their games people that enjoy games like europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2 football manager has been one of my favorite games i hope they can listen to their fans and bring back what we all loved about the game

buy fm every year but this one is by far the worst theyve put out in a long time i find it impossible to have a good season i tried with arsenal and got 10 games in and in that time i managed to also get knocked out of the champions league qualifiers by some team ive never heard of and ive heard of a lot i couldnt get one win in the league no matter what i did 20 shots 5 clear chances 0 goals opposition 1 shot 1 goal pfft it wasnt my tactics or the roles i had my players in or the players i used considering i bought a few big names and then i would put my team out and go and lose 40 to burnley sounds realistic to me another game with derby ended up 15th even though theyre predicted 9th and i improved the squad greatly its far too unknown they need to find a way that we can look into why we cant get results because imo theres nothing in the game that should have me losing 40 at home to burnley when id checked everything like tactics formations player roles morale team instructions

finally a reason to buy a new installment of this classic try the demo for free if you are an exaddict like me tldr summary player interaction massively improved coaching during the match massively improved match representation slightly improved if they used cgi capture for those movements than they have a lot to learn tactical finetuning  massively improved your profile as manager has a big impact on the game tracksuit or tactical manager transfers are more immersive  players will actually ask for a transfer if a big team shows interest like the sound of that read for more i bought every version from championship manager 2 1995ish to football manager 2010 then i bought 2011 on discount 2012 on discount and 2013 on discount and i realised i was stupid i was basically paying for a databaseupdate a brilliant update dont get me wrong but the game never moved on i skipped 2014 after playing the demo i just wasnt interested and decided to go back to championsip manager 0102 and try and safe sheffield wednesday from doom the gameplay was basically a bit simpler but no less engrossing i doubted about getting this so i tried the demo  and it worked more games need demos but aside from that the interface has finally undergone a modernisation process although at times annoying because you cant find things that were previously easily accessible i tried to find where jobs went for example but if it had just been the interface i still would have felt duped there is more to it than just the interface some of this might be gaming elements that were introduced in 2014 i am not sure because i never played that so a few examples to augment the tldr list this is from my first two games wednesday in the demo and wrexham in the full version interaction with players jeremy helan my french leftback is injured but comes back a couple of weeks before the transfer deadline his first game he plays well despite not being matchfit for some reason olympique marseille shows some interest in him and he requests to be allowed to speak to them i calmly tell him that i will if they put an acceptable offer forward they never did and he didnt grumble instead carrying on coaching during the match my fm manager persona is that of a calm occassionally passionate tracksuit manager in my wrexham career that calmness got severely tested when in a game my right back who had woefully underperformed all season got sent off wrongly and we conceded a penalty against bottom of the league welling we were 3th in the conference and smiling we go 10 down but i keep telling my players to concentrate and we pull one back just before the break after my central defender suffers injury after i used all my subs in the 60th minute they score another goal very quickly i tell my guys that there is no pressure and they manage to limit the damage with 9 man on the pitch to a 31 undeserved loss the following game however my captain and central midfielder gets himself sent off in the 10th minute despite me telling my team to not go hard into tackles he was just stupid we concede in the 23th minute and i tell my guys to show some passion we nearly score but in the 34th minute my left back gets his second yellow card in 3 minutes again down to 9 men but this time against gateshead a decent team they take us to pieces and end up losing 40 throughout the game i have been telling them there is no pressure anymore i needed to to manage morale following game after fining the idiots that got sent off i make some tactical alterations to fill in the gaps left by the banned players but it doesnt work woking score in the 24th minute and we seem unable to resist i change things around on the fly pushing them all higher encouraging them telling them they can do it and they do end of the game we have won 41 i have never felt so immersed with the actual matches in fm the animations are still mostly pointless playing this on a low gpu power laptop though but it doesnt matter you can now really put your mark on things from the sideline more effectively than ever before i might revisit this review when i have finished a few seasons but i have to give this version a massive thumbsup and if you are an expired fan of the series then treat yourself to this one

comparisons between 2014 and 2015 are like night and day ui and features have been improved but the match engine and gameplay are very very poor there are problems in the match engine right now that have been in the game since release problems that we have been told have been fixed and yet still remain 2015 is a mere shadow of what 2014 was and this version has left a very sour taste when it comes to fm games in general not sure ill be pursuing 2016 when it comes around

watching the matches definately ranks up there in some of the most frustrating things youve ever seen and the defensive tactics are seriously flawed was 8th in the prem with newcastle and needed some points on the board so after going 30 to west ham16th up i hit up my 4141 contain tactic just to not conceed and see the game out with 3 points35mins remaining not in football manager 2015 after making my last 2 subs to suit the new formation i pick up 2 injuries and down to effectivley 9men then draw 33 and that is barely the tip of the iceburg

far too many injuries sadly its ruining the game
not recommended
i have been playing since fm08 and cm before but fm15 along with fm11 are probably the worst ones in the series i was having 34 man getting injured every single game throughout the season always fit and if i was lucky they would not be injured for 6 months but few days but always all 3 substitutes would be for injuries early game every game lol the match engine was cool at first but then you get tired at every single person doesnt matter if its rooney or valencia will fall on their butts in almost every single dribbling move i liked some aspects of the game while it looks really cool in many ways but in no way would you play this instead of fm1214

as someone with no previous experience in this series and no grasp of football beyond the immidiate game i found this game absolutely impenetrable i enjoy the managing of complex systems huge fan of crusader kings 2 and can see how there is a rich variety of options and nuiance available that said the game is lacking in a clear entry point for the true noivce the beginner difficultymode as best i can tell only adds small text notes with insipid hints like this is the sidebar menu with has options for manging your team after hitting use suggestion during the setup a few times which was useful you are dumped to a general game screen with 1000s of options and no clear direction it is fine to have numerous tools at the players disposal that they dont appreicate immediately but you need to tutorialize the core game in some way as a starting point for them to explore and build off from instead it left the clear impression that you need to go watch some youtube videos of other players for several hours to get the basics making it feel more like learning a software interface than playing a game i will however say kudos to the developer for having a free weekend to try the game out at no risk the downside to this is that players will on a lark just try the game without doing a little reseach first if this was something i was condsidering purchasing i would have likely watched some videos and incidently picked up the training necessary to play before experiencing it first hand please consider adding a proper tutorial if you are going to have a freetoplay weekend so people have a chance to enjoy the opportunity

i have to start this review by saing i have had every version since the championship manager 9293 game on my old amiga 500 i loved the football manager games since they split in 2005 i think the first title was i have logged 1000s off hours over the last 10 years although this one not so much i have this title but oh boy oh boy this game has caused me to file for divorce as off the other day i could not believe what happened ok i was 70 up at half time with arsenal in the champions league play off 1st leg against some obscure european side i cant pronounce let alone even attempt to spell and what do you think happened by full time thats right it finished 77 i turned the game off and will not be returning to it also there is the constant injuries and know matter how good your team is or how great ur tactics are u will lose to the worst teams constantly i mean if this is how the future of football manager is heading i for one will not be returning in the future save your money

i really want to recommend this game but unfortunately it is the worst game since i started playing the franchise in 2012 having racked up over 700 hours in each of the previous two edition i am struggling to get anywhere near that this time around honestly im not even sure why i still play the game why inconsistent gameplay it isnt that the game is riddled with bugs it is just poorly engineered want to see your best players out injured for 89 months every season how about watching tottenham smash seven past chelsea and come second every season without any squad changes want to watch a player lose his  and put in for a transfer to a bigger club that is 1020 places lower in the world rankings have a player rated as consistent performer who has never strung more than two consistent performances together if that all sounds up your alley then youve found the right edition for you ffs si get your  together stop changing the ed interface and fix the ing game engine you idiots

rubbish cant even upload the game and get started
not recommended
i cant recommend this game despite it improving in many ways from previous versions the reason for this is the focus on player interaction this year players have always got unhappy for not getting enough game time too much competition etc this year not only does this happen more frequently but often without any justification you then get to try to talk them round which almost always ends in half the squad becoming unhappy at this point team morale is very low meaning you lose a lot and the only way to turn this around is to try and sell most of the team before you get sacked hopefully si will fix this in the next patch

its just not ready i really like the new look sidebar scouting match graphics its all very nice its going to be a great game its playable but i wouldnt start a long term save until some of the problems get sorted out injuries for some are out of control crosses are overpowered too many long range shots too many goals a lot of 50 74 games every year you get a release that needs to be patched before you can fully enjoy it this year is no different you see a lot of people upset and give bad reviews understandable if i paying for a game i want a finished product im half way into a chelsea save and have seen a lot of injuries early when the players were out of shape training was heavy and tactics were fast after some tweaking they stopped i am seeing overpowered crosses terry scores a hattrick some high scoring games once those issues get patched hopefully soon and not feb which seem to be just adjustments this game is going to be a great game buy it check out the new features get all your pics and logos ready test out tactics and play a few test games so youll be ready

this genre desperately needs competition si are complacent although this game is far and away better than 2014 i still cannot recommend it due to the stupid level of scripting si have in their game i get that the stories are what make this game fun but id much rather they unfolded organically than being shoehornedin by a dev team who clearly need to rein them in far far too many matches outcomes are predetermined those of you who have not played this game series as much of some of us may not have the hours necessary to recognize the patterns im talking about but theyre as follows  lose to a minnow in an important match  losewin the 2nd leg of a tourney knockout round after being hammered or hammering the opposition in the first leg  losewin the next important against a rival youve just lostwon a different important match to recently its ing ridiculous how often these occur in game yes they do happen in real life but nowhere near as often as they happen in fm si need to dial this  down because its truly tiring going into a match already knowing the outcome because the aforementioned criteria have been met

this game is a ing waste of time and money explain to me how they think football works you can scores goals from corners and crosses but no straight on you can have a better team rating and better players than your opponent and you still lose 3 0 at home ing  fix your ing game i wish that you could send your staff to courses or classes on becoming a better specialist at the current job they are in i also wish you could plan training camps to strengthen your team and players the good aspects of this game is that you can talk to players and staff which is good the bad aspects of this game is that you cant plan training camps or even upgrade your training facilities because they club doesnt think its a good idea it feels like im controlling manchester united and my opponent is cardiff city im playing at home and cardiff are winning 30 at half time that never ing happens this game at this moment in time gets a 4 out of 10 rating

figured id give this game a try since its so highly recommended and seemed interesting what i ended up getting was a huge amount of information poured into my brain at such a fast speed that there was hardly time to process it all im not very familiar with football anyway but with hardly anything getting explained and the supposed indepth tutorial only providing the occasional bubble of explanation its very easy to get lost in this game very quickly and end up in a situation where you can just stare at the screen saying i have no idea what any of this means does or why its important

was finally due to the sale price enticed to buy the game got pretty excited i found the new layout to be quite nifty interactions were nifty and then it got to the point where i was taking a closer look at my favorite club which is at point of writing at least still in the top 50 of biggest european clubs  the budget was all wrong some player names were horribly botched positions were botched potential for the academy players and status in the club was just awfully put together transfervalues were completely messed up the man whos supposedly the player with the highest value in the squad is actually in real life the most shunned and loathed player who the fans hope the club gets rid of as soon as they can and a substitute at most the list goes on and on and on cant recommend something that made me so upset right off the bat

i so wanted it to be different having spent 1000s of hours playing cmfm since 1996 i gave up in 2013 after getting so frustrated with rapidly dropping morale and crazy results for two years i sat on the side lines and didnt buy fm secretly hoping i would be able to come back one day and rekindle the joy the game had brought me for so many years this year i decided to give it another go desperately hoping for the same enjoyable and consistent expierence sadly all enjoyment has been sucked from the game all i found was random results i had pens in 4 out of 5 games crazy dips in morale when and shocking injury rates everything i loved about it seems to have gone like i said at the start i gave up two years ago after this ive given up for good si thank you for so many ours of enjoyment i hope you turn things around as id be sad to see the title continue to fade

skip this one i went back to 2014 fairly quickly after the excitement of trying a new fm had faded there are some nice additions to the game but theyve also changed what wasnt broken and in doing so have destroyed the realistic play seen in 14 the match engine with some new graphical additions off the pitch which are quite cool is simply nowhere near good enough for general release the redesign of the players and their animations is atrocious if you can watch a match and not notice the hilarious arms of the players then youre lyring to yourself this is more like an experiment with ragdoll physics than a football match engine players plod about the pitch with no real life in them the ball moves poorly and the pitches now look bogged down and ugly as hell no matter where you are tactics are not easy to really see in the match itself nothing is realistic in terms of the way the team moves the ball and thats on top of the horrible animations keepers are a little better animated and as i mentioned the stadiums have more detail and things but that doesnt make up for the core element of the game being so badly designed fm2014 isnt perfect but the match engine craps all over this one from a great height gone are the days of your lightning winger flying past his full back and getting a cross in now they waddle around with all the urgency of a bored duck theres no more slick passing moves that take into account your tactical instrucions the ball now moves so slow and the poor new sound effect for the ball being hit doesnt help again it just sludges around the pitch to no great effect the colours of shirts and things are also far too bright for no reason this wasnt present in 2014 there are things i really like female managers extra things to say to players a way to convince players your club is the one for them the sidebar being more intuitive and things generally being placed in area where theyre more easy to find and helpful than previous working my way through preseason i was absolutely enthralled with this game until the first friendly kicked off and the immersion just vanished in front of my eyes how pale are the really white players now they look ill arms are pathetic tricks are pathetic the whole thing looks far less graphically impressive than 14 which is hardly fifa level to begin with theres no excuse for this and no way to return the game and spend the money on something else like both seasons of walking dead get fm2014 with a good skin and all the badges logos etc from the workshop and save yourself some money on this checking back in october to see if theyve reworked the engine if not then i might have to finally say si have lost their way
not recommended
having read many of the other reviews i felt compelled to provide my own please note that my play time is considerably more than is logged since i play mostly offline currently as expected this version of the game isnt perfect some of the criticisms outlined in other reviews are accurate however i must argue against a couple of points made firstly the match engine seems fine to me i seem to score relatively regularly and concede a few here and there as one might expect it doesnt seem unbalanced from my point of view but then i suppose i dont always expect it to work everytime just because i want it to and rather i work on my tactics to make them more effective secondly a couple of other reviews complain about the new confusing layout while i admit i had a hard time finding certain things initially within the sidebar it really doesnt take long to get used to it and indeed i actually rather like the new look this game takes the solid foundations set by football manager 2014 as a huge improvement over the problematic 2013 version and builds on it it gives a fresh new look which isnt something i would have said it needed but now its here i like it in summary then from my own personal experience this game is very good indeed it improves in subtle ways on the previous entry in the series and from what ive seen so far it doesnt really take anything away either make of this what you will those people who complain might disagree with me but then im not from the school of instant success or gtfo buy it if you are a fan of the series i picked it up for a little over 20 and id say for the amount ill play it that makes it the bargain of the year

i have bought this franchise every year religiously since it very first came out this is the first year i have felt cheated out of my money where to start the new side bar makes things complicated for no reason whatsoever the old system was fine and didnt need changing it might just be me but the whole feel of the game has a far more fake feel about it while at the same time trying to add an unnecessary amout of realism i know this is a game but i somehow felt more connected to players and staff in the old one then you get to the matches the worst part of the game however is the god awful match engine the players look like chickens with flapping arms opposition goalkeepers appear to be the lovechild of neuer and buffon whereas mine has all the ability of a paraglegic my defnders seem to think that marking from corners means marking the corner of the six yard box and not moving and the guys on the posts are superglued there i took charge of manchester united incredible attack and i added well too yet my team had no answers to the might of the mls teams on tour pre season i went back over these games tried various formations and even went as far as using the in game editor to make all my players level20 on everything and still we were soundly beaten this seems to be a big flaw from other reviews i have read too as does the crazy scorelines i managed to pull off a 76 win over southampton with their cb scoring a hattrick from corners due to afforementioned problems and another fabulous 85 win over qpr after being 40 up and going behind 45 it has so many issues right now it is just not worth the outlay top and bottom if you have fm14 do not buy this game udpade the players and enjoy as it is superior to this in every way

this is literally the worst football manager game ever made i know its just the beta but it is still  your players get injured all the time and is out for weeks maybe months there is about 56 goals every freaking game and your players complain about little playtime after just one game on the bench also where is the bench were you set up your team before the game and how do you click your players onto the field and bench without dragging them over another players position the real game have to improve by 100% to make this a good game because right now it sucks wake up you tried to make it more realistic and you managed to send the game back to the stone age well done

i didnt like the game at all i cant even play it the colors of the background really hurt my eyes i cant look more than 10 mins i played football manager 13 before and that was much better than this background is fully black and all the other lively colors make it hard to read and you cant personalize this you cant see the additional packs bought in the game i am really frustrated i cant see the full pitch while playing in 2d mode i can not search for players after 2 transfers what is wrong this year

i love it but then again i love the tactical and the behind the scenes running of a football club and obviously it is one of if not the the best football managerment simulator on the market i have seen a lot of people complaining about bugs but in general i rarely get the bugs that people get in games on computer and console i havent had a problem with it yet after 52 hrs played there are features it could add to further improve it but still great game that can still improve only thing i could think of as a problem would be some of the unrealistic scorelines i beat liverpool 71 on the opening day as man united and as much as i hate liverpool i dont think they should be getting beat 71 especially when i hadnt even a full strenght team out

great game with amazing detail hard to learn how to play well but a season as a manager should solve that

the most realistic version yet to real life football i have played every version of the fm franchise and this is the best yet im looking forward to the next installment of the fm franchise im currently using the barclays premier league swapped with the conference northsouth by kingpazza goldenfm as i think its the best database on the steam workshop and well with checking out

love this game very entertaining so far rarely i got crash on this game fix it please
recommended
this is a very simple review gameplay good and is better than previous fms reliability very poor crashes a lot have now loast 3 save games due to gameside crashes recommendation stick with fm14  the loss of save games even when doing rolling saves is very annoying the new menu system is a bit weird and not exactly simple to find things had way more fun on fm14

paid 30 for the game it wont even start as soon as i click play i get a serious error fm2015v1521 message i tried looking for support on the communitysigames page but their website didnt give me permission to look at the fix pages saying i needed an account with their website i looked on the sega website for support again it didnt give me permission to open their fix pages im sure the games fine but the severe lack of support and customer service not to mention the many other people that appear to have the same problem means i have to give a thumbs down

its quite easy creating a tactic that creates a lot of chances millions of clearcuts but you see when a clear cut chance is created the game rolls two dice and if they aint both a six you do not score this is a game of chance and i have had more fun playing headstails

i just dont understand i have played fm 2013 quite regulary its not perfect but its accessible i have always made light of the match engine yes it has its problems but it has never angered me to the point that i feel its actively working against me fm 2015 has some really unique in depth features compared to fm 13 more events happen between players prematch build up and the scouting system feels much more accurate the problem i am having here is that i dont think i have really played enough to review the game i just know that i have played enough to not reccomend it to anyone match preperation was a great part of the game yet my formations are never trained enough in preseason even with a very high workload i wouldnt mind if this also applied to the teams i am not in control of it is entirely evident though that this is not the case with time i think i could become invested in this game however the turmoil of early game problems has led me to return to an earlier version of the game for my fm fix just go and play an earlier version and save yourself the trouble edit after spending several more hours i simply cant get into this game theoretically the more accurate aspects of this years release should create a better fm experience yet this is simply not the case the plethora of new tactical roles just bemuddles the overall system i really question if even half of these are used frequently in the real life game especially outside of the top flight of leagues i think overall enjoyment has been sacrificed on the altar of depth if you want a tactical system which requires constant maintenance and player recruitment which takes hours of trawling through players and weeks upon weeks of scouting reports i could possibly reccomend this game over previous releases also the new interface is absolutely shocking luckily the workshop provides some good alternatives

i had this sitting on my wishlist for more than a month before i decided to risk everything and buy it i was hoping to get it on sale but i got so bored with my other games i couldnt wait any longer being a long time player of the ea fifa manager series now discontinued and a one time player of fm years ago and read all the recent bad reviews i thought i was going in with my eyes open i knew what i wanted in a football manager game and this one just didnt deliver  particularly on the matchday experience everything was cool to begin with having to go for job interviews to get a manager gig etc i thought that was unique the whole build up to match day was good choosing tactics and formations etc its all very very detailed i was quite happy to tinker for hours before i decided to plough through to a friendly match then i was presented with the most godawful ui for match day and a 1980s 3d rendition of a football match which i eventually turned it 2d mode because i couldnt stand it for a game that has been around for how long this 3d match engine is appalling they would be much better off just having a text ticker for gameplay rather than a halfa55ed attempt at a 3d game engine i hated the interface for actual match play way too much clutter nothing intuitive you could only have 1 or 2 widgets up and running at a time it really hasnt been thought out well i wish i could take the ui and match engine from fifa manager and plug it into this  it would be much more appealing to me sigh another wasted $50 they do refunds around here update ironically within hours of this review it went on sale in steam aaaaaaarghhhhh

i can not believe i paid $33 for this crap 2015 game with such graphics it is just a game for those who do not want to sit infront of the screen do some adjustments and click on play go back to your daily works and chech once in a while other than that not worth a penny

football manager 2015 is the best version yet of the greatest football management game on earth it takes you deeper than ever into the world of football management and is extremely addictive the best feature is the 3d match view allowing you to see your players on the pitch actually score goals keep up the good work sports interactive and lets hope the 2016 version is even biggedr and better
recommended
there obviously are many problems with the game too many injuries last minute aids freezing players unhappy when you praise them etc but i still enjoy the game i didnt enjoy fm14 but i think this one is much better the layout is much better and even though there are lots of bad reviews and problems with the game i still recommend it to people who enjoy football and want to be serious about management

finally helped arsenal finish above 4th and win the league i am the true special one 4231 is the way forward 1010

havent played it that much its ok

i have played the last 3 football manager games and football manager 2015 is an improvment it more challenging then the last but at the same time it not impossible to win titles with the smallest club thanks to the complex match engine it all about how you use this game to get the most out of it 910
recommended
my team had over 60% possession and 30 shots half of which were on target my opponent only got 1 shot guess what my opponent beat me with a 90 min goal 100% would break my computer

tldr a yes i you like a slight improvement on fm10 with new skins and stuff but still not really a whole new game if you dont mind paying 12 for the experience then do so paying 25 isnt worth it for me fm13 just as good as this for me but maybe theyve improved the long term it seems theyve improved the big money on poor performing players so far though well this is my review after 4 seasons and 69 hours in maybe i should wait to write this review as im only a few seasons in yet it still seems like a slight update on fm10 i think the only improvemant ive really ever looked for after fm1011 is the long term play with previous games when you got up to 10 years there seemed to be no big players regenning and teams making stupid purchases then selling those stupid purchases on the cheap i skipped 14 as i saw no point in paying new game prices for a dlc oh and im one of those bought every game since cm2 players i got fm15 on the cheap which is the only reason i bought it also i dont play in 3d so my opinion is purely gameplay and not graphics 2015 has slight improvements but still falls back on the same old annoyances youre flying high and beating everyone but if you come against a bottom 3 team expect a loss but not a 10 or 21 itll be a 4 thrashing yes i know it happens in real life but a guarenteed 6 loses no matter what you do is unrealistic i expect thats football comments but it shouldnt be for 6 games of the year against bottom 3 whipping boys its also guarenteed your top players will get below 6 ratings in these games i play as small clubs and bring them up the leagues in the lower leagues the teams towards the bottom suddenly act like they are playing a big team in a cup game the goalie thats leaked 50 goals in 12 games stops every shot the strikers that have 4 goals between seem like ronaldo and messi then at the opposite end when you get to the premiership your small club which is playing well comes up against a struggling top team youll lose by 6 but again apparently thats football if liverpool man uc or arsenal will destroy you regardless much like the bottom 3 in other leagues and the problem still exists with you raining down 20 shots on target against a poor team then when you finally score 15 minutes later the oppostion will immediatley score the press still ask the same crap questions confidence is high etc and the people demand a response on your thoughts about a nothing subject i skipped a game year and these questions are still repetitive and pointless when i thought theyd been sorted out also managers can seemingley diss you now and you have no way of responding if tony pulis says im a poor manager who is arrogant and my team doesnt deserve the plaudits it gets i should be able to respond maybe im not looking hard enough for a tab to respond to him but at the moment i cant find it there could be so much more added on that part of the game so often as the smaller team fighting my way up the leagues ill throw a big contract at youngster or a loan offer then the response will be your team isnt good enoughgoing anywhere the next season ill find myself against his team if i beat them or im at the top of the table and they are at the bottom i shouldnt be able to have a dig which could result in his morale boosting or dropping i cant seem to find a the old tab of comment on next opposition instead of this you get asked about a youth player who left the oppostion when he was 17 returning to play his former team and how their fans will react even though he was there a season and never played for them also something thats not been improved is players getting annoyed at you i signed a player that was immediatley injured and out for 2months when he returned i eased him in and he got injured in training and was out again for a few more weeks he came back and before i could even ease him in he got injuredin training so the next time he came back i eased him in again and he immediatley complained i wasnt giving him chancei tried to reason that he was coming back from injusry he disagreed that i hadnt put him straight in to the first teamhe was signed on a backup contract i started him in the next game and he got injured he still wasnt happy i wasnt starting him when he came back this also happens with any backup players seemingly i know im here as backup but i feel i should be starting they are coming on as subs starting cup game and getting games when needed but thats not good enough even though they were signed as back up and agreed to this role this happened in previous games especially with the injured playing complaining about not been involved to sum up i really wish there was a neutral reccomend button i dont feel this deserves a no but i also dont feel its improved enough or maybe ive played enough to give it a yes like many youll probably see me go well over a few 100 hours if i get to season 10 and new players are coming through ill come back and say but as of now i see no major improvements on fm13 just tweeks i got bored in fm13 after trying to improve scotland singlehandedly winning everything and winning the world cup apparently did nothing the one advantage of playing in scotland was the bottom 3 thing and small club against big clubs didnt seem to happen maybe its just the english league that has that problem so i might give that a go if i get bored in fm15 i defintley wont be gettin 16 or 17 as again i heard there were launch problems with this one

football manager 2015 is a must for all football fans it enables you to do what it says on the title manage a football team the game itself has been majorly improved from football manger 2014 with the simulation looking crisperwith that being said i expect the simulation of the pitch looking better although it has been improved the graphics are poor but if you arent to bothered it then its all well and dandy for people that are new to this series you dont have to look at the pitch setting you can easily turn it to 2d mode which is good having clocked nearly 190 hours on this game since christmas day i have clearly enjoyed this game in the 4 months i have owned it and would recommend this game to all fans of football and people who like strategy type games if i had to rate it i would give it an 8 out of 10 the game is enjoyable yet can addictive at the same time which could lead you to playing this for hours and hours enjoy the game
recommended
good game this series is great to play if you live the series then you will love this one too 
recommended
quite possibly one of the best and most complete fm games ive played in a few years some of the recent entries to this series have been dire and have done little to try and move forward but fm15 feels fresh and easy to use even when navigating complex menus in such a thorough and detailed career mode highly recommended
recommended
this is a perfect game for any football addict if you love football this games for you so realistic makes you feel like your managing the team for real but its only a game it has every key feature you need to be a manager you can adjust finances and acctually interact with your players may not be the cheapest game in the world but defenetely worth it i cant wait for fm16 and i cant imagine how much better itll be football fan get this game
recommended
top eleven was my introduction to football sim i really liked the concept but always wanted to do more well football manager delivers i always go in thinking ill only play one week worth of games but stick around for hours the only complain that i have is the fact the fact that players always want to leave because im not matching their ambition we just got promoted twice show some loyalty hahaha but thats what happens in real life doesnt it highly recommend it to those fifa players that try to play career mode but its not enough
recommended
definatly recomend it has everything you want in a football managing simulation game even the transfers are realistic and hard to do

basically fifa but you have to watch a 144p football match between two shockingly awful teams oh and you dont play the match instead you become corrupt within fifa and sell your stocks to russia 2018 world cup here we come

so many injuries
not recommended
rly good game for soccer fans
recommended
so i have been playing this game ever since it started at number 1 2015 is a terrible game to play there is nothing you can do with your tactics or your team training everybody knows in real life not one club spends a whole week going tackling its more like a day when you tell your team to close down and mark tighter nothing happens to play every game with the same system is virtually impossible one match you will have guys marking the posts but the next game they are not there sega have spoiled what was once a good game this game is dire
not recommended
downloaded the weekend trial started a game with nice to see if the injuries are really as bad as they say i had my doubts in my first match with my reserve team there were three players on my squad that were injured two of them for about a week each and the third was out for about 3 weeks injuries are really as bad as they say i know that one match isnt a large sample size but with three injuries against my reserve team i dont feel like wasting anymore time its a shame because i buy these games on an almost yearly basis this years doesnt make the cut

the footballing actions you get to see suck
not recommended
this version of football manager surprised me in a good way the match mechanics are a lot improved contrary to other peoples reviews there is a lot less goalkeeper fumbling and also the matches run a lot more smooth and fluid instead of being very choppy i think the little subtle touches they have added actually make quite a big difference the only negative is the 48 month later buy still works which does kind of break the game a little all in all still a great buy 810
recommended
just quality overall i really am addicted to the game i would recommend this to anyone especially if you love football this game goes beyond what you can do in regular fifa and its just overall a fun time
recommended
crazy addicting very detailed game 1010
recommended
well my hours shows alot can be improved  database needs to be relooked and rechecked  tons of inaccuracies birthdays and heights etc  aimatch engine needs major improvements especially player movements there should be more hurrah and more deep sense of achievement whenever your club wins something besides the basic news printoutinterviews maybe include playerfans tweets open bus celebration players own postmatch interviews tabloidfootball media should be more humorous and should do more indept analysis of matches overall those a just a few flaws that can be improve 7810

will not be buying aymore of thesethis one is basically the same as last seasonsdont waste yer money on thisits a total ripoff to us loyal fm fans

dont know why people moan theyve been moaning since domark did cm2 on the amiga everton overpowered supertactics free transfer glitch man marking keepers to score 70 goals a season now its not enough changed keep your knickers on loads has changed like a full seasonal update for one just like next years will do the same you know what you are going to get with yearly titles especially sporting ones if you want radical changes youre playing the wrong game even so fm is one of the few sporting games out there that tries to implement new features in the last 1012 years weve had match engines agents ffp more leagues media player interactions numerous training revamps tactical overhauls now go play fifa 20089 and see if much has changed there is a reason some games dont change their gameplay that much its because its good
recommended
absolutely love the fm series and have now played over 900 hours on this one alone will play it all day and all night if i could would recommend to anyone who wants to see what football management is like in more detail
recommended
i plan to tell people the 500 hours ive put into this game so far is because we had a baby and when im not taking care of him i dont exactly go out and party or do anything really the truth is though my baby is only five days old i really just cant stop playing this game you can do anything even when i somewhat get bored and decide to go find some other sports manager game i always fall back to well it looks cool but it doesnt have everything that fm has and ive already made a career on fm and and things are going well i just want to see whats next classic mode is basically the mobile version in my opinion which i also own it doesnt offer nearly the depth as normal i usually start a save with one team but by about 4 years in im controlling a number of head coaches most of which i like to start uunemployed and work my way up the lower leagues when i started playing i would always pick the top tier teams to start but the games richness really come from battling it out in the trenches of some random countrys pyramid with players who make less money in a two week period than i do there is also no better feeling than when your 16 year aold wonderkid regen grows into a well groomed goal scoring machine and helps win a world cup for his country leads your team to the champions league or sells for a $150m even though it hurts your feelings to sell him the only thing i would comment almost negatively about is the ingame editor its not even a negatve really because its awesome and if you really want to get the ball rolling on a team and have a dominating season quickly move someone to your club you cant afford or turn a no potential regen into a wonder kid its very easdy to do so thats the only negative comment be careful with the editor because youll get too good too quick and get bored when there is no one better to buy its also very hard to stop using once you started thats all 1010 from my experieces with fm09 to date
recommended
i honestly hate this game so much the ingame mechanics are so unrealistic like the defender just stares at the person running by them and they defend so horribly i defend better than these defenders also the opposition goalkeepers are so overpowered like wtf my player is 2 meters from the goal and the goalkeeper flys from the other side of the goal and grabs it once welbeck shot from the other side of the goal and de gea just teleported to the other side and caught it in real life it would have been a 100% goal this game would be a million times better if it was more realistic ingame
not recommended
played fm14 before and will gladly stick to 14 longshots and headers dominate in this edition with possessionbased tactics falling by the wearside to be replaced by routeone and direct stuff the match engine is ridiculously inaccurate and keepers are as good as an u12 sunday league keeper wish i never spent full retail price on fm15 hopefully patches balance it out

this sums the game up in my opinion last two games rangers 44 dumbarton 9 yellow cards 6 red cards  3 each all but 1 of the 8 goals were own goals rangers 4  2 motherwell 3 red cards 1 own goal riddled with bugs need major improvement
not recommended
horrible the new play engine is simpy not acceeptable  this is a downgrade i could not finish the first game 
not recommended
really dont understand how the me gets worse 2012 was ok just needing a bit of tweaking 2013 onwards have been shocking with the latest being the worst i fully understand that fm is a management simulator and that si will say it isnt meant to be fifaesque in terms of graphics etc but that isnt my gripe the major issue i have with the me is what you see happening in no way relates to your instructions or the stats at the end for example you concede too many from balls over the top so you set the team to defend deeper but when you are viewing the match the back four are still in the halfway line what is the point in having the facility to change something if the me doesnt reflect that change same with ratings a keeper drops one into his own net then kicks a ball stright to the opposition to score his rating is a 7 from what i see he is at fault for two goals yet if i discipline or drop him he thinks its unwarranted as the stats say he played well nothing you see happening relates to stats some of the interplay is laughable world class players look like baby deer trying to kick a ball and the decision making completely at odds with what players especially good ones would do in those situations only real benefit of th game its updated database aside from that its a poor imitation of previous versions save your money

unsure on which way to swing with this game its good but so broke in saying that though 14 was broke up until january what annoys me about this game is how awful your goalkeeper becomes when your 10 up with 10 mins left the amount of games ive drew or lost being 10 up with 10 mins left is unreal but because i have faith in si id say buy it but when its in a sale or something cause 30 is far too much for a game that is still broken
recommended
i would recomend it its only got a few problems which i dont mind about every game as problems at first i dont seem to have the problem with injuries i play with carlisle united and doing quite well 2 in leaugue had one player injured in 15 games and one sent off its good ive played these games since they came out love it each year i enjoy
recommended
i see a lot of negative reviews here some even from experienced fm players to be honest really experienced players dont seriously play fm until final patch  that one with winter transfer updates which also usually fixes all unwanted stuff like injuries corners woodwork oneonones and other weird things devs did to ruin gameplay they do it every year btw youll see the pattern if you continue to play fm  its almost a tradition just remember that football manager until the final patch is a public beta and youll be ok as for the game itself i played one season so far and enjoyed it there were too much injuries but it can be considered as a challenge also rotation and young players were extremelly happy to replace crippled first team members there were too much woodwork but several fms back it was much worse there were some nice goals and dramatic matches overall it was typical football manager experience  not ideal but quite enjoyable match engine improved a lot  much less scripted goals much more goal diversity my player even won goal of the month award  thing i cant remember since introducing 3d match engine still we have a lot of morale goals during 4648 min period but i guess itll never change anyway you can have some fun with fm15 or die from a rage attack your choice tldr try it but starting longterm careers until patch 153 is out is unadvisable

i have enjoyed my time so far as acmilan manager within fm2015 it is a game that like 2014 ramped up the difficulty and you have to have a team throughly prepared you also have to be very careful in what you say not only to the players but to the media morale has an impact in the games like 2014 and long streaks of losses can be brought on if you are not up to the mark in man management there are some dodgy goal keeper animations that often cause goals rare off the wall scorelines and often times follow up conversations with players that dont quite relate to the previous conversation but they are not exactly game breakers the game has brought in a much more streamlined interface that i have found a very welcome addition i have always found the news an irritaion and have waited for the return of how 2010 had the headlines away from the inbox and i have found 2015s way much more to my liking the game is very enjoyable and one of the few that often has me making noises when goals are missed or penalties given it is nice to get that sort of immersion setting up your profile as manager and being able have coaching stats and ratings to use in game are great finally running the training yourself will have a greater effect i really like it the positives outweight the negatives by a long way and have found it the most enjoyable fm since 2010 the game engine is good the management detail is fantastic the scouting has been revamped i like the uncertainty brought in with vague ratings eg passing 1619 i like that teams try very hard to hold onto their good players for example i found a future star according to all my scouts his value was below 1mil but the team he was with knew what i did and would only sell him for 42mil i recommend it its worth every penny for the management fan or football fan alike
recommended
this i my first time buying and playing a fm game i usually play fifa on ps4 however this is a breathe of fresh air love the layout and how you actually have to think unlike fifa or pes coop is awesome and great with friends would definetly recommend and i will be buying future ones for sure wonderful game

its alright

dont be put off by all the helpful negative reviews they were made when it was still in betajust after beta the game is very good and i have found it to be the most enjoyable game yet the 3d match engine has been slightly imporved players do skills back heels and the layout is just aesthetically pleasing

ive been a cmfm player since cm 0001 so i think in can say it with some property fm is a great football managing game always were and still is but this year beta edition was totally flawed literally broken as of beta 1503 most of those bugs were solved now i had only observed a few bizarre defensive errors and some excessive red cards but i can safely say that this game will be proper in the release date good job si there was some good additions as the rpg like feature to estipulate your manager skils and the possibility of team talking during the matches not only in half or full time also i liked the new scouting system its not only more beautiful and easier to adapt as it seens to be more effective the tactical screen was also improved its now more reallistic and fluid with some nice additions to the tactical options ill list the main bugs that affected this game until the beta 1503 and update their situation as si realizes the patches all of them i observed in all my 3 saves playing in spanish italian and brazilian leagues propositaly with top clubs real madrid juventus and cruzeiro  lots of goals bizarre gk and defensive errors lots of own goals this was totally adressed in the 1503 update there still some keeper and defensive errors but most of them seems acceptable as this is a football simulation game still there are very few defensive errors especially with wingfull backs that seems a bit unrealistic  iconstancy long winning and losing streaks without apparent motives as ive said im propositaly playing with top clubs so as of beta 1503 im experiencing long winning streaks with some unlucky draws and some loses to stronger teams something closer to what one can expect playing with these teams  bizarrely high frequency of yellow and red cards 34 or 5 reds in one game all games of the round having red cards this seems to have been adressed but still happens sometimes i know some football games tend to be very violent but having 3 red cards in two games of the same round in the spanish league it still seems fishy to me  excessive player transfers demands and team meetings this also seems to be adressed players now seem more mature as when to ask for a transfer and of when to call a team meeting but there still some bugs as when llorente asked me a new contract and i promised to give him one in the end of the season he accepted but the next day he was mad at me because i didnt agreed with a new contract straight away and called a team meeting of course or when one of the younger players asked me for a transfer in the very first day after the window closed and not adressing your players demands severely hinder their morale and their performances now  i still dont like the ui but i guess ill just have to adapt to it this game now is totally playable and im pretty sure that si will manage to correctly patch him untill the release date a must buy for all football fans as always

won the premiership in my second season as leicester city currently in the semifinals of the chamions league not great on the reality front still better than leicster in real life good fun game for veteans and newbies alike some concerns about the game engine some justified though really the only viable football management game out there get it its on discount

starting off i have played and enjoyed football manager games since fm 08 played a couple earlier editions with my dad a couple times but fm 08 was my first ever fm game this game is an absolute must have if you are a football fan especially if you enjoy the tactical side of the game as well personally i love the tactical side to football and i love creating new tactics creating and developing new clubs and making a whole new generation for the football club if you like this sort of thing with a hell of a lot more detail than a fifa career mode for example then this is a must have pros of this game  very detailed game ie you are able to manage the entire club in great detail  lots of possibilities you can take forest green rovers to the champions league if you really want d  very good training and scouting  the most realistic management game out there please note that these arent all of the pros these are just a few main ones that stick out feel free to comment anymore you see cons of this game  addicting  seriously prepare to end all contacts with everyone to play this game  some bugs in the match engine for example  goalkeepers and defenders are a stand out example it will frustrate you its mainly the corner defending that defenders struggle on it will annoy you  can be so frustrating > yet somehow addicting feel free to add any of your own cons too  thanks for reading i hope if youre reading this you found it helpful and maybe if you were considering buying this game i seriously hope i swayed you in favour of this game because trust me it is awesome thanks marshyy

the refined game play that makes it the choice of couch managers worldwide has been further polished to maintain fm as the undisputed king of its genre
recommended
doing this for the xp
recommended
got over 700 hours on record great game
recommended
very bad no much happens
not recommended
i got this game 5 days ago and already have 75 hours played fair to say im addicted
recommended
010 it broke my screen and made me fail all my exams but i won the capital one cup so its all ok
recommended
fifa 15 is the simplistic version of fm15 who is worse at graphics than fifa 15 in fifa 15 u play the game at any dificulty in fm 15 u are just watching to the game so i should put 10 more euros for fifa 15 sry but i give 25
not recommended
wicked game
recommended
good but not great 710
recommended
fm15 very addictive but the players are still not that quite intelligent yet bumping into each other  kicking ball their team mates and stuff like that but i think its ok to play and stay up all night 810
recommended
recommendation for every football fan

i havent played fm since the 08 so had a pretty tough beginner time with this one but after a day everything seems ok now i am surprised that i havent experienced the injury bug like a lot of people have been talking about in this patch the game overall was fantastic the only thing that  me off is the 3d match really hard to tell if the players got tackled or not sometimes it feels like the other players just purposely tackle ur players the ones whos about to receive the ball in the pelnaty area and nothing happens even the commentary doesnt say anything the models are just stupid sometimes they just stand in one place and let the opponents run passed them the goalkeeper never pick up the ball when they are supposed to overall a lot of things wrong with the 3d system hope they will develop in the next game
recommended
hmm a well familiar players are too expensive to buy for an average club to buy
recommended
great game doing this for the steam achievement but its so good to play on long flightstrain and a welcome break from fifa 15
recommended
fantastic management game indepth players club attributes ive played every football manager game and every year they get bettergreat game enginetho i dont use it i like to play with 2d classic modethousands of players to scout from around the globejust a few glitches there are a few bugs that need fixingbut this does not affect the gameplay in anywayoverall id give it 85 out of 10 fantastic footy management gamea must for the any football fanplease notesay goodbye to your freinds and family as you wont want to stop playing
recommended
the same game as fm 14 but updated
recommended
i have been playing football manager as long as i can remember and i absolutely love this game but injuries are still a slight problem but apart from that i dont know how they could top this game
recommended
its simply too fun sure it does have unrealistic results but at the other end it is just too enjoyable with friends or withot it is just too good
recommended
great game perfect fit for football fans most enjoyed when played with friends
recommended
you manage a footballl team of your choice
recommended
brilliant game the best manager simulation out there at the minute however i feel it gets a bit boring after a few seasons  just my opinion
recommended
a brilliant game
recommended
ok people who rate this game as bad well there people who need to stick to playing fifa yes playing 30 a year is annoying but there are improvments to the game that do make it worth it end of
recommended
seriously bug after 15 minutes  all players in club change d wow
not recommended
fantastic best 1 yet to date 1010
recommended
won the champions league the premier league and the fa cup in the same year with tottenham so realistic 1010
recommended
brilliant game got to say im addicted to it at the moment as you can probably tell by how many hours ive played its quite difficult at times but i got walsall to win league 1 in my first season so im pretty happy

got the game on saturday lost about 17 hours in these past three days to the game abandoned all social obligations trying to get leeds united to the premier league currently sitting comfortably in 8th place in the championship at around january havent been this addicted to an fm like this before i wont stop until i get leeds up or i get sacked 1010 feeling sleep deprived yet slighlty content with my efforts in the game liam marching on together
recommended
love this game also have had hours of fun well worth the money
recommended
addictive as always
recommended
great game better then fifa
recommended
the best game ever
recommended
much better interface than fm14ontop of this the new mocap they put in the game adds a nice layer to the game not present in 14 for veterans of the game series theres just as much tatical depth and choice making as before whereas for begininers there are handy tutoriuls as well as a bountiful amount of fan create gudies and such i would recommened this game to anybody with time on thier hands
recommended
as someone who is not your typical gamer i never know what to expect from a game but i thought i would play this as it is a bit different from the rest of my collection i was not dissapointed at all it took me a little while to get used to all the screens but as i went along i found myself really getting behind my team and almost shouting at the screen during matches haha very good and a wicked time killer
recommended
yes but not for full price like a lot of people i feel that paying every year 5060 bucks for only few changes is not ok i did not buy the game at full price
recommended
this game is addictiveif you love soccer and managing a teamcountry then you should definitely buy this game
recommended
meh a improvement is a improvement whether its big or small
recommended
apart from the occasional ridiculous injury crisis its a good game
recommended
very great game
recommended
why there is no badges in russian leage  why than is player injured during the match  he still can play until the final whistle  the game is great  i can play hours 
recommended
one of the most addictive games ever 
recommended
one of the best football managers to date this is because of the new skin and the better more in depth database
recommended
sick game bar the inconsistency of the teams apart from that so realistic and quality
recommended
so far im enjoying this game after 50 hours of gameplay i took the team morecombe from league 2 all the way to the top league in england
recommended
the game is still good despite all the negative comments by a lot of players out there they could still improve the graphics engine while the 3d match plays and the other thing that really annoys me is that no matter which team i manage i will always end up with a lot of injured players and mainly my 1st team players will be out for mths
recommended
its football manager what more do i need to say i have put around 70 hours into this game trying to win the epl with my liverpool fc team i did it 810
recommended
guided halifax to the champions league move over hodgson
recommended
love it cm & fmveteranenthusiast since 199394
recommended
too addictive
recommended
how do i stop playing 
recommended
top notch game been playing fm since 11 like it tah
recommended
been playing these games since the original premier manager now with fm2015 it was hard to get used to due to the different interface but its still a good game plenty of stuff to do challenges working up from the lower leagues
recommended
hard as balls
recommended
its good enough for me
recommended
its excellent its much more in depth than any of the fifa games or any of the other football simulators this is one of the best simulation games that ive ever played if you love football soccer you should purchase this game
recommended
why cant play
recommended
won the league with liverpool most unrealistic version yet
recommended
thas was is good
recommended
there could have been more improvements from fm14 but still the best football management simulator on the market cant see that changing any time soon looking forward to seeing what 16 brings
recommended
very good game for pepole who love football its pretty complicated at the start but you understand it easy fast 
recommended
based on 40 hours of gameplay i usually try to write about a game after 25 hours but with this being my 1st ever experience with fm it took a bit longer to get used to or even understand what the heck i was doing with that said i must say i find this game to be very enjoyable im no soccer fan to the point i can tell you anything about any player team league or competition i just watch it especially the world cup & bpl with that said ive learned a ton about soccer simply from playing this game and make no mistake there is a ton of stuff in here the depth you can take yourself is beyond explanation i have a challenge currently taking place on my work pc and a career in effect on my home pc you will be busy making decisions moreso than actually playing a match and theres the fun of it its the wheeling and dealing that gets me more than anything i always start from the bottom in any game i play so i spend a lot of time working my way up from the lowest leagues to the premieres in fm15 you have to manage your squads staff finances and the media among other things and if you like micromanaging you will definitely enjoy fm15 your board players and staff can be real pains in the  sometimes but it makes the game that much more realistic and challenging since my playing time i havent come across any bugs the game runs pretty smooth and the speed of the 14nation games i set up is pretty fast no crashes to report the 3d engine is pretty much rubbish though i mean it isnt bad but lords of football runs rings around fm15 in that department and to be completely honest with you sis released version is pretty damn ugly it looks too much like a spreadsheet i hate it youll hate it the over 2 million players playing it hate it therefore you need the essentials at the time of this writing i recommend you installing these mods to make this game shine 1 fm 2015 flut dark skin v18 or later [makes the game gorgeous] 2 dazs8 mini stadium packs [adds team stadiums to the club homepage] 3 dnk 20145 backgrounds megapack [adds beautiful wallpaper to different aspects of the game] 4 fm15 real names fix files from sortitoutsinet v11 or later [selfexplanatory and very useful] 5 megapack tcm15 [adds truetolife logos for just about every aspect of the game] 6 sortioutsi cutout megapack v73 or later [adds truetolife player faces in the game] these mods work together to bring you a more effective and visually appealing layout to the game the flut skin also makes it a lot easier to read the information given and brings more information to the forefront while reducing your need to hunt for resourceful information whatever that may be verdict without mods 6510 fun experience with nagging interface issues verdict with mods 910 an exceptional sportssim gaming experience
recommended
i cant stop playing send help
recommended
best fm so far it will ruin lives and you will never see your friends again
recommended
fun except actual gameplay is tedious and luckbased i reccomend playing on classic so you do more of the fun stuff and less of the press conferences interface is great 7510
recommended
brilliant game
recommended
welbeck can actually finish in the game
recommended
legendary classic must buy you can take liverpool to a few premier league titles  oh wait thats not possible
recommended
its amzing just the game for football or soker fans
recommended
won the league and cup and champions league with barcelona no lose any match
recommended
probably my favourite installment of the series in recent years
recommended
587 hours and counting it just never gets boring
recommended
stop injuring my key players on international duty 710 would tear anterior cruciate ligament in a friendly with estonia again
recommended
as someone who has put in over 600 hours into this game i definately recommend it i took concord rangers to the premier league title really rewarding
recommended
pretty addictive game steep learning curve at first but keep improving your team every season start with a lower league team thats where this game shines
recommended
another great football manager game they just keep getting better & better each year been a fan of the football manager series since football manager came out the challenge of this game is amazing the buying selling of players finances of the club profit or loss transfer & wage budget scouting for players for first team or for future is remarkable interviews for the job morale of the team buying & selling of staff many more features to this game is just wow 1010 recommend this game who wants a challenge to become a football manager
recommended
nice game very deep game view about managing football teams
recommended
reading the reviews i thought this would be a bad game i played it on free trail i was awesome i have played the previous fms this one has few flaws like many injuries but i was totally hooked for 14 hours non stop i was sad when the trail got over i was totally devastated i would totally recommend you to get this game its a must buy game if your a football lover who loves strategies your going to just love it made me feel like a true manager unlike its previous games which were average to me this one was really realistic only injury flaws were unrealistic otherwise this game would be a 1010 with the new fix of ver 155 i would rate this game a 910 because it got me really hooked
recommended
football managing at its best perfect for all the fans out there

recommended
if you like soccer and if youd like to manage a professional team probably this game is all you want  however graphics are terrible the soccer games seem to run in dos microsoft os before windows 95  ouch  you cannot recognise your players on the field  710 >> because of the bad graphics simply not acceptable in 2015
recommended
rep great banter
recommended
only bad thing is that there are so many ing injuries otherwise its addicting and fun

love it
recommended
highly recommended  a must have for football fans
recommended
awesome and fun to play it can get a little bit confusing with so many different player stats etc though
recommended
just remember to eat
recommended
a very nice and detailed football manager game i have enjoyed this game a lot but in future though please sort out the stupid errors defenders and keepers this is so frustrating to watch so much that i have to just put match highlights on commentry only and i would also say to make the game more realistic it looks very unrealstic when the players passshoot etc apart form that though its a solid game and i do like playing this game its easy to pass time with it gets a 810 from me
recommended
really fun game to play to pass time also if you enjoy football and are tactical then buy this game
recommended
one of the best games ive ever played quite brilliant really a few more features id like to see though likie better graphics when watching the 3d games and included player faces club badges kits
recommended
this is the first football manager game i have put any time into i tried a few but gave up after about an hour i love my football and this time round i actually took the time to read a few websites on starting about and what tactics would work for my team this made the game for me alot more enjoyable since the difficulty curve was a little more forgiving i have read alot of negative reviews on the game especially the 3d match engine but i feel that the match engine adds to the game and i love watching the matches on extended highlights even if sometimes your defenders will do stupid things  overall if you love your football and are willing to put a few hours into learning the mechanics and a few google searches on how your team plays you will have alot of fun
recommended
brilliant game spend hours creating squads 1
recommended
besides traditional sports games and online shooters this is probably the most time ive spent on a game let alone a sim where you dont even control the players directly simply put i love this game as i said ive always been a fan of sports games mainly nhl and fifa and while i loved the online competition i also really liked to manage my team tradebuy players arrange your lineup and strategy ect heck i could spend hours just trading players or trying to anyways resigning them scouting out potential new additions and whatnot thru all this believe it or not id never heard of fm in my defense id been playing exclusively on consoles for the last 67 years so when i found football manager a game that is precisely about the management aspect of the team i jumped on the bandwagon and boy am i glad i did i love how much control it gives you over a team i mean contracts training transfers tactics name it its there and in great detail contracts have a bunch of clauses this canadian had never hear of tranfers are not as easy and simple as youd think sometimes and tactics can be tweakedadjusted to your hearts content there arent many things more satisfying than taking a lower league team and with careful management and ambitious transfers turning them into a top flight powerhouse who challenges for the league and champions cup year after year one of the downsides tho is that when you do manage to raise a lower league club to glory it seems the chaiman andor board dont ajdust their mentalities quite accordingly therefore ive won the bpl twice in a row with fulham now coupled with a champions league trophy and various cupsshields etc and im still making around 4550k a year and the board doesnt want to expand our new stadium 3 yrs old of 365k capacity even though attendance is through the roof and the club are raking in decent profits and are atop the club value table another le is the sim engine who will sometimes decide to decimate your team with injuries which isnt as bad as early on thanks to updates but i did have to use up all my subs in the first half once because three players went down i mean seriously and they were all in the 90% fitness range too boot it will also make your players miss an absurd amount of scoring chances with the very occasional highlight reel strike from 30 yards strike and exremely rare bicycle kick going in other than that nothing significant really brings down this gem of a game couple it with a decent facelogo pack to make it look more realistic and the fm editor and a custom skin amidst the vast array of choices for a truly customized experience and youll be all set for countless hours of fun
recommended
quality made game difficult to master you must have a reasonable knowledge of football tactics to jump straight in however theres many forums across the internet ideal for learning the basics
recommended
8 out 10 for me love the franchise love the game and love the new ui the only thing i dont give 1010 is because of the crazy looking goals i getgive in the game still my favourite football managing game and would recommend in a heartbeat
recommended
its a very fun game already got more then 1000 hours on record ofcourse the game is running while im watching tv just proceeding to next match comparing this game to earlier fm versions the side bar is very handy
recommended
truly terrible match engine fantastic in pretty much every other aspect save yourself some frustration and just look at the stats during matches like the good old champ man days that way you wont have to wonder why your goalkeeper has nailed his feet to the floor or why your centre backs slip into comas from time to time
recommended
if carlsberg made football management games this would be it awesome almost and i say almost better than fm07
recommended
great game
recommended
you can do want you want to your team its like fifa but different
recommended
love it

havent played in a while while i was wating for the updates had too many problems with it but it did play on win 8 81 previews normal and pro lets see if it works on windows 10 pro tech preview build 9926
recommended
bought the game today because there was supposed to be a patch to fix the terrible defence and injury problems i just started my first ever save and i already have 16 players injured every time i hit continue i was just waiting to see how long the next injury would be also if you thought this game had any semblance of defensive players actually doing anything other than scoring own goals or watching players walk right passed them you are in the wrong place i realize this is the beta but the release is in 4 days and i dont see them fixing that many problems with a comlpetely broken game ill play it again on release and the next patch but im back to fm 2014 not much better until then will update review upon full release andor next patch edit next game after writing this review i had 3 players injured during the game this takes my total to 19 injuries before the season even begins my reserve squad is nothing but loans and more injured players as well maybe thats just bad luck but seriously how can this many people be injured long term all at once update upon playing the full release i can officialy say that the defense is still terrible and starting a new save fresh for the release has resulted in 9 injuries before the end of the preseason with crewe alexandre so i am no longer playing the beta and as i guessed the problems have still not been sorted out guess ill just be waiting until they patch more to start again if im going to lose my life to my football manager addiction it wont be to a severely bugged match engine
not recommended
game is different than other incarnations in the fact that the ball in the engine is quite bouncy until it hits the turf you cant play one formationtactic as the game goes on in the full mode or you probably will lose as the ai makes adjustments im currently in the middle of a hyde coaching run really enjoying the low level start and the ability to go to caoching courses overall if you want a full indepth rpg of a management game with the newest players this is worth it if you want a game that is already modded polished and fully tweaked fm14 might be a better value i bought it ill play somewhere near 600 hours again this year so i cant help but recommend it if you enjoy strategymanagementman management games no other game has had me fist pump as hard as when the regen scouted cb gustavo ellacopolous scored the winner for tottenham in the champions league final the game is as good as the effort you put in especially at a lower league team
recommended
play this during the winter and dont snack while doing so  guaranteed weight loss  slow starvation  best year in a long time  bought of steam direct and just clicked play no silly codes etc 1010
recommended
so far its pretty great usually managing large teams like barcelona which i am can get boring fast but this time star players are harder to manage and now have a mind of their own this make things challenging the stats of most players i know are satisfactory you also have better control of your team when you make a touch line shout it actually affects how your players play the game the only thing i found annoying was that the transfer embargo of barcelona was put a day earlier than it was supposed and i couldnt get gundogan becaus of this 
recommended
probably the best fm in years looks better allows backgrounds and seems to run smoothly
recommended
this is a fantastic gamelot of bugs in beta version but looking goodhooked againlike in the past 15 or so years
recommended
if you have played the others your soon know how addictive these games become in terms of is it better than 2014 well at first its not simply because of getting used to the new layout but once you master this then yes all the way better player interaction and match engine and simply more behind the scenes as well to tweak the staff on this game have been improved and how you utilise them while still providing a challenging experience 1010
recommended
generally the game has much the same feel to it as recent versions sure theyve moved the menu system but its still all a bit messy to look at the match engine is funny the number of players you see just falling over or deciding to slowly walk to a lose ball while the opposing players sprint is a joke not to mention its still bugged with so many long range shots from outside the area you can train all your players to restrict long shots and set individual instructions to not take long shots and set the team instruction to work the ball into the box and still they all do long shots rather than trying to take defenders on as ive instructed all in all its still a good game just like the last version nothing special has changed and id recommend most people stick to the previous version and just update their data
recommended
great fm game has some issues which get sorted out soon anyway but its fun as hell
recommended
the beta version for this game isnt impressive too many basic and fudemental errors eg cant right click players into positions have to drag them and it takes ages and you cant do set piece instructions as the button does completely nothing  but the game play is far better this year with similar graphics to fifa
recommended
absolutely awesome the new features are fantastic gets me continue playing and playing addictive again well done si if possible they should add voice commentary in and that will be definitely awesome
recommended
liking it changes to the game are subtle and things i cant be bothered with like press and training are far too repetitive but in saying that it has it good points the over feel of the game is good with the new ui they have made a lot of improvments a word to the developers think big rather than loads of small improvments you guys need to go for a big leap try and give us regular customers something to get excited about stadium design or being able to create a club from scratch in the lower leagues of a country and make it a real force over 10 seasons but all in all if your a fan of the series then youll be happy with this
recommended
so far i loved the game really good and fair enough to play it this year graphics really good teams nice players awesome and perfect training system in my opinion just the best fm till now awesome guys really deserved the 50 my review is 910
recommended
only complaint for fm15 is ridiculous prices for players tried to buy shaquri from bayer and they wanted 67 million no way is he worth that 1520 max then tried to buy kovacic from inter and they wanted 51 and lucas leiva this is ruining the game with stupid prices hope they can sort this out
recommended
i have loved this game series for years and preordered the new one and even though i would reccomend it it is slightly bizarre loads of goals loads of injuries loads of yellowred cards and sometimes you go on losing streaks that are unrealistic and absolutely impossible to get out of i finally managed to get ahead in a game and one of my players was sent off so i lost it sort of seems like they want to make it as difficult as possible they just need to tone it all down a little bit and it should be fine i mean one player i was against scored 4 in the first half i mean liverpol are bad the moment but i think it is slightly unrealistic for abel hernandez to get 4 against me in the capital one cup in less tha 45 minutes never mind i can focus on the league oh wait it is impossible to win in it im sure it will improve once the beta period is over
recommended
i will recommend that you buy this game dont listen to all this negative recommendations
recommended
same annoying quirks as last year  injuries implausible goals meaningless ratings etc but with a slightly different skin not worth the money at full price if you see a decent sale and you feel like throwing away a few shekels then feel free to pay for this crap  i got this for game free and i still feel cheated
not recommended
the beautiful game just ot a make over after playing the series for a number of years now i was expecting the same thing yet it seems so much improved on things i didnt even know needed improving 1 example is the competitions menu it shows where you are in the league and cups the staff are more helpful and i like the introduction to tunnel interviews the 3d graphics now involve motion capture in them and look much improved 1 thing that is really noticeable is tweaking a system example my false 9 striker was not getting any goals but i was winning games i change him to poacher and he gets bucket loads if you love football and you love the idea of managing your fave team get this its a no brainer
recommended
so far so good lots of new features to play with couple of downsides so far though new layout seems more cluttered than before stock skin is horrible on the eyes hoping someone makes a nice clean skin like fm2014 was easy on the eyes playing as a club with red as a primary colour if very difficlut to do as are some of the other colours not so bad with white
recommended
i love the series but this one is a mess so far there are some good new features in the game like the new scouting system  makes the game experience even more realistic i played with carlisle utd  a low profile team in england second devision which relegated from 1st devision last season the initial goal was promotion  the board set a budget of 0 transfer funds and 45k wages for additional players i believe this goal is almost impossible to achieve even for the most hardcore players i loaned 8 players for free from teams in the premier league and signed few free agents but even with them my team couldnt match most teams in 2nd dev i am still recommanding the game because i believe si will fix all issues
recommended
although the most challenging of the series so far more because of the new adaption to the layout and the scouting methods for me its a big improvement on user interface but the harsh amount of injuries it makes progression a longer task where you have to put mild detail into the smaller things instead of throwing it to your below par am i suggest it if you put a good amount of time into the later games but for a newbie 1314 would be a safer choice in the way of enjoyment of the game and winning things
recommended
just as good as every other there is no better game out there
recommended
pros new ui while it may take some getting used to its superior to the old one scourting much better and more realistic than the old system also great new scouting reports stadium view with banners chatting with players board journalists etc improved new tactics creator much better both vissually and technically cons need some patching goalkeepers seems to be completely useless even the top ones plus their reactions in 3d game engines reminds me of kidengarden kids tring to goalkeep they make me wanna go to 2d games again the new generic logos for the non lincenced leagues are bad guess well have to wait for workshop to fix edit after all the patching the game is much better the goalkeeper works much much better
recommended
this game is a pure simulation for all football fans i recommend it
recommended
very much similar to previous iterationsbut thats exactly what we are looking for
recommended
addictive
recommended
even better than 2014 one the management style interface player search and scouting these and many other changes makes it awesome
recommended
i bought this game expecting to be hired by a real football club however im still waiting this is slower than amazon
recommended
nice game nice interface pretty accurate database i always thought that it was a scissors paper rock game and i should just fine the thing to win all games but its not the thing you do on the bench really affects the players on the field the 3d is indeed pretty bad but for me it doesnt matter because i use 2d if i wanted a graphical football game i would have chosen fifa instead the initial version was full of bugs but now with the latest updates it feels good
recommended
infinitely better than fifa also i have no life any longer
recommended
it is a great game to play and the menus look better it is worth the money
recommended
better every ingod year
recommended
quality game eats up so many hours but when you get it right its so rewarding
recommended
good game defo worth the buy
recommended
this is the worst and most expensive game i seen in my life and it crashes every time 1010 would crash again
not recommended
great game
recommended
been playing the game for a long time now probably the best game that makes you spend your whole day your 10 minutes turn in to 2 hours of playing
recommended
not really ez to manage

fun and worth

still the best football simulator game after i missed the 2014 series this 2015 series is a much improvement from 2013 series the most improved part is 1 higher complexity in handling players contracts and negotiation with other clubs as well as 2 the improved tactical variety players role etc while this could be a little bit cumbersome for those who new to this series i believe the builtin tutorial will be very useful
recommended
another wonderful addition to the football manager franchise im an avid fan of the game and truely love this version dont be put off by all the negative comments if you enjoyed playing any of the previous versions buy this one and just quite simpily expect more details brilliant purcahase hours of funswearing at your players may i also reccomend the dvd released along side this game it was a fantastic insight i wont spoil it for you though
recommended
the dribbles and fouls are so kyooott
recommended
great game veteran player of football manager series and i feel this game lives up to the football manager reputation i got it at christmas time so missed reported bugs that now mainly seem to be fixed as ever match engine can be tweaked to make it better but overall football manager 2015 will provide many hours of fun
recommended
same game new format
recommended
first season caused lot of injuries but after 1st season injuries gone its balanced and enjoable
recommended
1010 this game has ruined more of my hours than anything else have been playing football manager games even before steam  absolutely sucks you in the best part is when the players you scouted and picked up in game for cheap become super stars in real life 
recommended
good game like all year 
recommended
very good game best of the fm games shame about the premier league not having the licensed badges but this can be added using steam workshopgame is more fun when playing online together rather than single player my opinion would definitely recommend
recommended
the best football manager yet just expect regular injury crises
recommended
this is a true greate game
recommended
it has beautiful match engiene some glitches but overall its fun to play the scorelines do seem to be unrealistic at times but i love how everything has unfolded beautifully in 2015 you have that thrill playing against the rivals and getting new big name player id love it to be bit harder and have some more tactical and traning settings
recommended
i love this game the people who keep saying its bad dont know how to play the game properly its one of the best in years for me
recommended
best one yet 5 stars
recommended
first football manager that i have ever played so i cant really tell if previous games were much betterworse i havent had any bad experiences with the game the game runs smooth no crashes or other errorrelated situations also the diversity and possibilities within the game are good in my opinion i am playing an online mode with a friend of mine which makes the game even more fun never thought i could be so addicted to this game but wowits pretty addictive if i say so
recommended
i cant enable in game community to access the in game editor can someone help
recommended
with last update i am beging to love the game with proper graphics it almost like fifa 13 graphics in terms of game play but still need improvement the best aspect of this is the scounting aspect you need to get this games in order to experience what i am talking about
recommended
i ing hate this game
recommended
more of what made the past games great

great for any football fan who loves the more tactical approach to football football manager offers great detail without scaring you off by being overcomplicated also there is great choice in game as you can choose to take a lower league or nonleague club and rise to european glory or start at the top and try to retain your position there a great buy
recommended
best football managment game out there only negative is that at start of season 1 the money youget is vlowglitch or intetional 99910
recommended
guys where is life
recommended
it is amazing
recommended
really enjoying the game right now i like starting with a lower league team and rising them up to the top league im currently playing as stoke after being offered a job there because i promoted york city to the championship loads of possibilities my only issue is that there should be some fmc features in the normal fm mode apart from that good game
recommended
not just a game its a lifestyle
recommended
best football manager so far and i play it for more than 10 years
recommended
a great game that deserve all the plaudits a rather addictive games that keep you going on and on for more tactially exciting and intriguing at the same time looking forward to the upcoming fm 2016 addition
recommended
people not recommending this game cause it is hard but if u can play it it would be amazing
recommended
great can not stop playing
recommended
football manager puts your favorite clubs fate into your hands will you get them promoted will you get them relegated will you win the league will you win the european cup these are all questions you must decide before taking hold of your club i took charge of ac milan and was able to win the league 4 times the domestic cup 3 times and the champions league 2 times in 4 years the modding community is great because you can do everything from recreating you favorite childhood players from changing the skin of your game fm is a great addicting game for any passionate fan of the beutiful game and must be respected as such because fm is life
recommended
pretty good game as usual very addictive definitely recommend a
recommended
okay i only have 11 hours but i will keep this very simple for you 1 the game is really fun a lot of scoring and cool new animations xd but yes but this game is filled of injuries i just had 3 injuries in one game my replacement for the injured player got injured someone will be out for 45 monmths in the first 5 minutes he injured for another 9 yesars damn
recommended
love it but you think west brom would not come 2nd in the bpl in one season but there did
recommended
loving the new gameday stats
recommended
so right i have now played this for 10 hours and although this is not nearly enough time to review a game of this enormity i felt very compelled to write this review on how incompetant the game is as opposed to previous iterations i have started my game thrice as the same lower league team ofcourse i understand that this comes with its difficulties but having 3 players injured after 70 mintues and one of them red carded is simply unacceptable this is an absolute joke and then you have the backroom side of things where players are constantly wanting to criticise my manergerial skills even though we just started the league and we are on a 4 win streak what this game is very polished and the interface and everything is fantastic but the ai and the injury rates are absolutely cated id much rather take a dump in my hands and clap than play this excuse for a game again
not recommended
a lot of people over the years have hated certain new installments of football manager however for an addict who has been playing since the first cm came out everything is as beautiful as it should be every year  unless you play with the 3d graphics on which is absolutely horrid but then again you can never go wrong with 2d of course there are some bugs during matches and some inequities but when youre a manager you know that life aint fair keep on managing till you cry blood when you score with your underdog team against one of the big guys of football and have that mental  when your months of tactical work pays in the end the best  that has been changed are the ui scouting and the tactics panel i absolutely love the new circular star things over the players in the tactics screen im an fm addict so whatever you give me i will play but those of you who feel the same about it will surely love and play this game anyway we need that fix yo
recommended
really enjoying this game although there was lots of injuries when i first started i feel like the game is a harder and focuses more on man management for example if your player is unhappy about their contract or the amount of games hes played then he can disrupt the squad unless you sort the problem out overall im enjoying the game my highlight so far has been managing man utd and being 30 down at half time against newcastle at st jamess park before switching to an attacking tactic i created and bringing on james wilson who scored a hattrick in an incredible 43 comeback that included two stoppage time goals
recommended
this game is a must have i hate soccer in real life its so boring to watch and i think its one of the worst sports however this game is amazing that it makes me like soccer and makes me want to get into it the realistism of this game from simple stuff like player moral to the more complicated things if only ea sports could do as good of a job as this company does this is way better then football manger 2014 fyi
recommended
addictive really addictive really really addictive
recommended
still the best football game available on pc for those who want an indepth football experience with an almost endless varity of opinions and possibilities it is a must for any football fan 1010
recommended
the sidebar is welcome generally the screen layouts have been much improved however the match engine feels like a bit of a backward step although i understand that its early days for the motioncapture route their taking the one thing that drives me mad the most is the sound of ball being kicked a noise happens every time a player kicks the ball even if its a mere tap a foot a head of them this is most fustrating during intrasquad friendlies when there is no crowd noise to ease the pain
recommended
hooked already great game and love most of the changes
recommended
every year is ing better best football simulator in the history of humankind hahaha
recommended
good game but takes 3 minutes at least to save the game please fix that
recommended
i only recently got this as a prerelease before it comes out on november 7th i never played any previous fms and this is certainly very addictive if you like football you will love this game i didnt even go with a top dollar team o
recommended
first of i have to say that i love the fm series with over 180 hours in fm2012 near 200 in fm2013 and near 400 hours in fm14 i started the game as manchester united and played my first season being crowned champions i believe i have an idea about the game so here are some pros and cons pros the interface takes a while to get use to is great better game engine animations and such new ways to transfer players talking them into it etc scouting makes sense game created youngsters are good potential view is better at scouting cons its hard to sell players talking to the chairmen got harder wonderkids level up in a long time update 2 since the game came out i changed the review 910
recommended
loving the beta love the new interface better scouting and training system animation is better except the part where players seem to be skating i dont care worth every penny for the fans of the series if you are new to the seriesgenre then you may wish to wait out the bug fixing phases
recommended
bought this game yesterday and is playing through the betavery nice interface much better than fm2014 looking very nice cant tell enough as i have only played it for 90 minutes but it looks brilliant as usual
recommended
i rate 88 but seriously though this is a great game for the past two years ive spent way too many hours on football manager games and i reckon this wont be any different yeah there are some problems yeah it could be better in some ways but hey its a brilliant game other than these miniscual problems i fully recommened it to anyone intrested in football as its a game with so much depth you wouldnt beleive pros  detaildepth the database is used by real clubs its accurate addictive you just dont get bored challenging its much more challenging than in recent years interactions its nice to see much more options in interviews 3d match engine yeah its got its problems explained below but its still good new ui design the new user interface is so much easier to navigate give it a couple of hours and youll never want o go back cons  3d match engine the only reason its a problem is if your tactics arent good enough it makes the players make stupid mistakes and can be quite unrealisitic and frustrating but if it was 2d it wouldnt be as bad just because you cant see the mistakes as much just get your tactics right match engine so hard to defend so easy to score expect lots of high scoring games for no reason crashes this has happened 34 times since i got it on the 2910 happens at any time hope it gets sorted soon just set it to save every fortnight and youll be fine so overall another great game which i much prefer over the recent games and fully recommend
recommended
well after fm 14 i didnt think that m going to buy another fm but i decided to give it another chance and i m proud of my decision even in beta its a better game than fm 14 interface is nice and clean with a lot of information scouting is really good and match engine is really smooth with motion capture even in beta this game is the best fm game ever
recommended
this game is highly reccommended by me 100% buy the game has had a huge improvement from 2014 and the game has come a long way since it first started 1 huge feature that they have improved is the way your team listen your advice and it can actually make a difference in your new features making it a more realistic manager simulator the wide range of players and team availabe and giving you a chance to choose how much of an experienced manager you are this is a must buy to big football manager fans and dont be dragged into it being a copy of last years version to me it is a huge improvement from 2014 must buy
recommended
best football management game theres is simple as that
recommended
this is the best fm ive ever played some wonderkids really can make a difference despite of their young age the game machine is getting better
recommended
its still the classic football manager but the new interface just inst quite as intuiative as the old some good new features but a few bad perhaps i need time to get used to it but i have had to look some things up to work out how to do them there is definate room for improvement not too sure about the role you play as a coach either but that might develop
recommended
buy this game hire roy keane as assistant manager this game have done something completely new to the series it has managed to perfectly capture the personality of roy keane im so amazed at how everything this game makes him say or do matches reality 100% the brutality of his tactical advices his ability to motivate his nononsense way of dealing with reporters also hes a mental coach so theres the fitful juxtaposition roy keane mental in every advice tab ive not had any bugs and everything is running smoothly great game
recommended
match engine not as good asprevious needs major surgery if it is to succeed
recommended
keepers seem to be really slow at reacting and bad back passes are a reoccurring theme but overall a solid game
recommended
really dont understand these complaints about high scoring and bad goals id had the game since the beta came out and suffered no such issues ive started a man utd file a spurs file a norwich file and an online southampton file and my only complaint is unrealistic league positions like burnley being 2nd by december or chelsea being 18th for the 1st 2 months of the season ive lost 40 to blackburn in my online file but i can say that was due to me throwing together players who werent tired from a mid week game maybe im one of the rare lucky experiences but the concept of football manager is to build a team with your tactics and your players you cant just make a tactic and throw players together without them playing together for a couple of months regularly chopping and changing disrupts the chemistry of the team thats why there is a bar to determine how comfortable your team is with all tactics and formations i agree that defending can be non existent at times but again you just need the correct player and team instructions to put this right
recommended
good game love the series and this game has been very enjoyable to all those talking about highscore lines its football in football there are all kinds of scorelines if your a fan buy it of course it has its issues but si do patch the games its a well supported game
recommended
new ui is very good seems that there is a lot of matches with too many goals too easy to score and concede
recommended
well its obviously much improved from last year fm edition improved gui which need sometime to navigate through much improved scouting etc that was exciting but of course it can still improve for the upcoming weeks
recommended
keepers seem to be really slow at reacting and bad back passes are a reoccurring theme but overall a solid game
recommended
the best game out right now whether it be conquering the ancient world colonizing a map or planet winning a world war or dominating your fictional baseball league this simulationstrategy for some reason has always been and continues to be more fun and better if you arent a soccer fan yet it is only because you havent played this
recommended
worse than championship manager 2008

i was always a bit nervous about the releasing of a new version of this game ive played all of these since 2010 but the last two versions of the game were pretty disappointing always best soccerfootball management games on the market though and im pretty happy to say that this year the game is good also at the current update it have a nicer design is more realistic they have improved the player market still more work should be done on this and the game is faster to sim i always liked sim games but i think the better game by si was ehm 2007 this because it was funny great still best hockey simmanagement game on the market and really fast i dont really understand why they give you all the rosters teams and championships of the world if you cannot select more than 1015 of them with the rest of the world that remain silence no players no offer for your players what i really miss is an option to fast simulate championships as ehm 2007 give you as an option i prefer to lost a little and also more of info but be able to sim a world however this year the game as improved much in this sense you still have to be able to play on a nice system but im currently sim all the default teams excepts from asia with a small database and the game seems smooth i dont know if can be worth to add asia and mods for new championships as the game suffer from a great deterioration of sims speed if you play with more of 120000 players 140000 are still good really recommended
recommended
at the time of posting fm 15 has very few bugs after a poor release and is now at the point where anyone who was holding off on getting it should pick it up
recommended
great improvement on graphic this year
recommended
better then 2014 thats for sure
recommended
the graphics look solid and the gameplay is so smooth but only bad thing is set pieces because i use manu and i conceded 24 set pieces from 26 goals that i conceded but apart of that everything alright9
recommended
good game plays well there arent too many injuries as some have suggested nor is it too difficult with a well devised tactic and a solid training plan success is very possible having said that there is now a bug that prevents the loading of the game at all steam yet again is proving to be an utter abortion of an application why on earth im compelled to use this third party trash to load my game is completely beyond me
recommended
great game
recommended
cant seem to get started again after beta version but was good upto that point
recommended
this game is a must buy
recommended
not sure there are bug or not but average booked 4yellow card per match wth btw overall still is a good game
recommended
the fixes have been excellent and fm 15 is a fantastic game

great game if this is what you are into football club simulator basically at its core when you get into it you keep wanting to see what happens after the next match wish i had more time to play
recommended
i recommend this game i love football maneger and this one its one of the best some bugs of course but nothing to worry about with
recommended
overall very decent good upgrade to 13 although the game time sideline chat feels like it doesnt have much affect easy to explore good menu design and new report page with strengths and weaknesses comes in handy
recommended
would defonately recommend to the fellow football fan
recommended
database accurate and very fun game
recommended
ing  i cant play thsi game
not recommended
it is ok i played a little
recommended
glorious
recommended
just buy it simple as best game ever one downside is since i started playing fm when i got fm 12 i have been put on the missing presumed dead list rip social life
recommended
great  thats a perfect game 
recommended
wow what a bad interface there is nothing intuitive about it i was really looking forward to it but after a couple hours in was mostly just annoyed
not recommended
not funny game and its cost so much p
not recommended
i am playing the series since 1997 so i have a clear view of the game proggression through the years although i just bought my copy i can say that there are some really interesting changes like scouting reports the new 3d etc its a great game as you always expect from si sure there are some things that can be fixed with patches but i have to admit i am also worried about the injuries in my first game month my team already has 6 injuries and all of them are 6 weeks if that is some kind of bug and not just bad reallistic luck then i am sure it will be fixed in the next few weeks with a patch or update
recommended
new patch urgently change the match engine to make the game playable
recommended
good game better then 14 more tactiacally involved buy players want too much money and clubs want to much money for a player
recommended
ive already bought the game but when i go onto steam i cant load the game up does anyone know what i can do
recommended
its annoying that it gives away some bad goals rarely though but apart from that fm15 is a great game
recommended
same game as the last couple of years its a little better with the newest patch but a lot of things still dont matter  the teamspeeches dont seem to do anything or you get negative results from it even though the game says you should say that to them  clubs controlled by the game buy up all of the best players and then dont even let them play making it very diffecult for you to create a team that can win big prices the players how go to those clubs and the after a year are put on the transferlist dont want to move to your club because they are playing at a better club even though they didnt play a single match  scouting uses a system where you can see what percentage your knowledge of a player 0100% is but there is no option in the scoutingmenu to say scout to a 100% and even then at 100% sometimes the players potential still isnt completly scouted  when asking the board to raise the salarycap for staff members it gets raised by 200 euros which isnt nearly enough to get any improvements  whenever one of your players get injured during a match its never the games fault it never gives itself a red or even a yellow card but you get red cards constantly  still cant reload my save during matches its an offline singleplayer game if i want to reload my save during a match who cares these are the main problems and yet its still very addictive the best football management game out there and i cant stop playing
recommended
when i try to load my saved game it just comes up with cannot load saved game
recommended
ooohh guys i havent seen enough of 3d match and playing to criticize injuries but tactical window is really awfull i am playing fm for three years and learned a lot of hints that use but i cannot cast overall team picture first of all it regarding player roles team in tactics window looks like a heap of scrap i failed to set up player roles through it new image of correspondece skills and position needs to measure with a scale it very uninformative second tactics windows on a match on my 15 display i see only part of player skills when try to find him optimal role its very very uncomfortably dear developers please fix it on the next patch but early will be better reccomendation is advance curse of fm that before third path  game is really different to play good luck we trust in you
recommended
if you love to build or put together things  like teams  than avoid this game because its fckn addictiv
recommended
best football manager yet
recommended
they should actually try to make a good 3d so we could watch the games instead of just reading the comments or watching balls vs balls p and the injuries  anyway i enjoy 90% of the time playing it so its cool 
recommended
good information
recommended
i love this game i would also recommend to anybody that likes to play the game as relalisticly as possible to google mods for this game there are alot of mods that are not on steam workshop that are very easy to put in and it helped my gaming experence fm15 > fm14 all the way
recommended
buy the game its deep its deeper its the deepest football simulator ever
recommended
multiplayer works flawlessly in my experience playing with 3 friends everything outside of the match engine is significantly improved over last year the match engine is worse than ever with odd goalkeepers lots of injuries and extremely glitchy gameplay when playing online its really funny to see how awful the stadiums celebrations and general gameplay is and its still a great rpg in single player its considerably more frustrating but it makes for some funny stories and there isnt a better alternative if you want a realistic footballsoccer simulation this isnt it its not even close however you really arent going to do any better and you will still get over 500 hours out of it if its your kind of thing
recommended
quite different from the earlier versions and will take some time to adapt some new fixes but all in all it feels more or less just like an updated version of fm14 with transfers etc would still recommand unless you have higher expectations to the game
recommended
started with football manager 2013 just out of curiosity one of the top played games on steam being a soccer management game lolwut since then ive been hooked though this series continues to be the best management simulation game ive ever experienced and this year only gets better match engine and tactics are far better than in 2014 from what ive experienced so far and its a great game overall like always
recommended
top game in the world  1111
recommended
overall fm15 is a good game different from fm14 providing different tactics and new ways of training there are also some improvements regarding press conferences they are shorter compared to fm14 and the question variety is greater touchline team talks was also a good addition and the overall general layout is technically easier than fm14 saying that though if you are an experienced fm player be prepared to take a while to get used some minor details such as making a player avaliable to the under 21 squad is under the development tab instead of a squad tab the 3d match engine is slightly better however sometimes the goalkeepers do not behave like real goalkeepers in the 3d match engine not diving sometimes the keeper slides across on his two feet to save a shot instead of diving other than that it is an improvement however the game by default does not have badges or logos or many player faces you have to download that yourself the tactics are technically more straight foward if your new to fm you may find them easier compare to previous fms however if you are experienced it will take a while getting used to the changes to conclude i would reccomend the game however it is not a big improvement to 14 and it may perhaps be better to wait for 16 or wait for more updates however if you do decide to buy it it is still worth it
recommended
i hate the issue of syc cloud for my save game i have been playing on 2 computers and i never get syn for my save file and do not tell me about setting that click on that little check box i have done hate this problemmmmmmmmmm
recommended
i have only played this game a little bit but its ok
recommended
enjoying the new layout although its taking a little longer than i expected to adjust the game does seem to be a bit harder than 2013 and 2014 which is good
recommended
i bought this game a little while after its release and have to say i had some issue initiallyi think its very very different from earlier games and that was an initial turn off but now iam abit more into it i think its wonderfulas addictive and fluid as ever time to change my underwear as before 
recommended
such an addictive game once you get in to it great fun getting a low team into the top league
recommended
great game
recommended
the game definitely has some issues but it is still your bog standard footy manager and i am enjoying it
recommended
i saw rather a lot of negative reviews for this complaining not enough has changed or been added from previous additions this is the issue with sports games we predominantly pay for the transfer window update and a new skin but with the return of the side bar better player interactions and the weight of your decisions being more important than ever  football manager 2015 is just as addictive before and im sure i will sink many more hours into this until 2016 version is released with updated transfers and a new skin ultimately this is the best thing to sink hours into and with no alternative and its much better than fifa for management sims this is as good as it gets
recommended
reading all the negative reviews of the game i thought id come and give my two cents ive played fm since the 2005 edition and fm15 is my favourite iteration yet the game makes you feel now more than ever like youre in charge of a football team that is composed of individuals not spreadsheets here are the pros and cons ive found so far pros player management has been revamped this year and players behave more realistically than ever you cannot sign a player on a key player wage not play him and expect him to be satisfied if you drop him for no reason additionally other players in the squad may side with him and make your position untenable resulting in you getting sacked for losing the dressing room or on the contrary complain about you treating him too kindly if you give in to his demands players going to the press will also get picked up a lot more and you will be facing insistent and often annoying questions on how youre handling the player in question this leads me to the next pro improvements to media handling anyone who complains about the increase in media occasions from fm14 must not know that you can give over control of media handling to your assistant handling the media is a key part of any managerial job and i appreciate the fact that si have tried to make it feel as real as ever having a pesky journo run after me in the tunnel after a  performance i found myself snapping at him which shows how effective adding these rather small features has been at enhancing the experience of managing a football club the match engine is a lot prettier than earlier versions the interface while it takes some getting used to is great and feels a lot crispier than earlier versions small decisions like splitting staff and player searches into the staff and scouting categories make the game easier to navigate scouting has been vastly improved and it is now easier than ever to make the scouts suit your needs rather than them giving you reports you dont want to see the option to have them scout leagues for specific player types such as a replacement for an ageing first team player or a promising youngster also add to the organic feel of the game cons although the match engine has been tweaked since the release it still needs a bit of work crossing and long shots by players who given their attributes really have no business hitting 30 yard screamers 5 times a season still exist although theyre being worked on injuries seem to happen in waves where youll spend 6 months injury free and then have 5 players get long term injuries in the same week its frustrating but again the last patch did introduce changes to injury probabilities it just needs to be tweaked a bit although i enjoy the new interface the tactics screen absolutely sucks and needs to be changed in future patches the star for the players comfort in that position and circle around it to indicate suitability compared to the rest of the squad in particular is hideous if its that difficult to describe in writing then it shouldnt be a feature those are the major gripes i have on the game the losing against promoted teams when youre on a 5 game win streak may be frustrating but if you look at real life football thats often what happens teams who perform well against strong opposition may get complacent and slip up against minnows the fact of the matter is that if you love football no game out there will allow you to experience the beautiful game quite like fm15 does the changes arent perfect but theyre there and si has patched issues that the playerbase found with the game and say what you will about them theyre passionate about football and really care about their game which game dew do you know who would go and get written permission from a 15 year old wonderkids parents just so they could put him in the game and let players see how he turns out the game is far from perfect but ive put dozens of hours into it so far and have enjoyed every second of it i cant review fm classic as i dont touch it but the fully simulated experience is as close to managing a football club as youll ever get without going into the profession yourself 910
recommended
its ok  it can sometimes make you happybut alot of times really really angryi would reccomend it but the most id pay 4 it would be 25$
recommended
this game in a word is addictive i find myself losing hours to this spreadsheet simulator which to all my better judgement seems to be a random number generator which calculates football scores completely detatched from the rest of the tactical managerial business behind the scenes and yet there is a chance that the tweaks you make to the team that lost 21 last time away to brentford would transform the team into chelsea beaters and take you to the fa cup final and win glory for your beloved team and that emotional empathy this game creates is as close to the real thing as watching a real football match on the tv superb
recommended
football manager needs strong rivals just like a serious football team while the fm isnt the most innovative and most impressive game around its still the best football management title 810 would recommend
recommended
best football manager experience you will ever get worth every bit of your money
recommended
buy luis suarez for chelsea for 110m scores against liverpool at the kop end and celebrates in front of the liverpool fans brilliant
recommended
football manager 2015 is extremely addictive one of those games you can play for hours and still have fun and is very easy to work with even if youre a beginner id suggest this game for those who enjoy football as a sport of just watching it
recommended
this game has been a massive improvement on fm 14

football manager 2015 does feel like a siginificant improvement from 2014 which respectively wasnt that much different from 2013 or 2012 they added more animations when in game which is cool but i still dont understand how on my save messi has not won the ballondor for 4 years he isnt like he is in real life which is strange whatever still good you should buy it probably or dont like i care
recommended
where do i begin i have been trough it all lately inevitable injuries to key players constant leaking goalies the ridiculous crossing goalies 74 defeats to nonleague teams that i should have stomped on and of course some disasterous defending by my players ai but still i come back to it again and again hitting my head against the same bloody brick wall day after another and for some reason it has worked i have had couple of saves which have gone fantastically so far the ai still is kinda  but way better than at launch new additions such the sidebar and more indepth scoutin have taken a another small step towards realism and i feel like the abnoxious pre and after game journalist mlestations are easier to handle so i am going to give it a recommendation for what it is but please make the game properly and dont leave it all for beta testers to get trough i had one save on the beta and it was abnoxious and almost unplayable it might have ruined the game for some players before it even came out
recommended
better and easier to use ui better match engine with more realistic movement more tactic and role choice
recommended
as always a briliant game never fails to impress at all
recommended
enjoy it a lot much better than fm 14 all problem has been fixed

its horrors arent to be taken lightly the obsession the addiction the wasted months the sleepless nights as you strategically weigh up transfers and tactics and finally that tearstrewn crackofdawn moment when you realise you just cant take it anymore your finger trembling over the mouse as you finally click delete football manager is nothing more than page upon page of statistical data offset with the occasional virtual match that you cant actually control but to the many fans of the sport it inspires an infatuation unrivalled in the world of video games a feeling of power and control not unlike that of the civilization series but on a more realistic and micromanaged scale you take charge as head manager of your favourite football team and through player and staff purchases regular training plenty of tactical planning and the occasional bit of luck you can guide them to fulfilling victory  or frustrating loss unlike its playable football counterpart in the fifa series developer sports interactive has year after year ensured that its latest iteration is always a significant overhaul of the previous edition bringing back compulsive fans not just with updated rosters but through key feature changes and additions this years fm2015 release has a host of updated features aside from the updated 3d match engine graphics on game day the true highlight is the option to choose between being a tracksuit manager and a tactical manager the two often overlapping in previous editions here the choice between getting deeply involved in either the training or strategies is an important factor not just in the gameplay but in how players and staff react to you as a leader the only real problem with this truetolife recreation is that accuracy is occasionally taken too far such as in the unfocused but essential meetings regular chats with your staff and press are required to place your team at the forefront of this moneycontrolled world but it often comes at the expense of entertainment its true that realism should be the goal but a balance is necessary especially when repetition starts to set in fm15 doesnt break new ground but it does build on a decadesold formula to ensure your life will soon be dominated by a delusionfilled virtual world of fictional players fake matches and simulated football management

awesome game never fails to impove year in year out
recommended
great game very addictive played the football game for a while now and they only seem to get beeter each time
recommended
i am a big fan of the fm franchise and this game is just as good as the others
recommended
first time ive been addicted to football manager since it changed from champ man
recommended
the game was great if you play 20142013 its fm2015 basically the interface change roughly like it by the side but i got a question is it grey and black because its in beta hahah
recommended
only minor changes from last years game match engine definitly needs fixing as defending is nonexistantoverall though i would still say this is the best football management sim out there
recommended
steam is the worst platform ive ever come across on the internet its criminal that eidos make you use it ive paid for a game but for some reason am not allowed to use it completely useless

footballs not just about scoring goals  its about winning alan shearer the moment when i become the best manager in the world with my beloved team  priceless <3 after 700h pros  lighter engine  significantly fewer crash dumps  managers profile  rest cons  sidebar  so stupid muddled management options  crimean national team a great shame for the sisega subjective rate a but still this is my beloved game series except baldurs gate <3
recommended
it is footballl management game very rarely are there bugs in the game new ui is good and some cool features added to this game enjoy football want to try your hand at management try this it is worth the investment
recommended
i personally have found football manager 2015 to be a much better game than 2014 on the whole positives more realistic gameplay the footballers dont repeatedly try to shoot from impossible angles the game flows better and feels much more like a real game of football negatives certain bugs on linux hotkeys and window switching issues the game feels a lot easier than 2014 ive started as southampton and went unbeaten for 2 months not impossible but this did include competition like arsenal and liverpool who i beat 41 and 42 respectively i would reccommend this game definitely it is very fun and well worth 30 while it feels slightly unfinished it feels like it will be perfected next major patch though
recommended
great game
recommended
pretty good game
recommended
good game to play with friends hours of fun for the football fanatic
recommended
this game has stole my life
recommended
the ui takes a lot of getting used to even if youre a veteran fm player even the best players in the world seem to struggle to play properly for some reason i dont believe they really went above and beyond with fm15 but it is still an addition to the franchise its decent but not leaps and bounds above fm14 if you are just getting into the series pick it up if you already own fm14 and want a new challenge its pretty good for that too i would recommend it
recommended
great game love it <3
recommended
great game
recommended
best version ever no matter i set up the team defensively or offensively i cannot win the game to add insult to injuries literally injuries
recommended
good game i kinda agree with goals coming from corners but all in all i like it 
recommended
football manager 15 at its best
recommended
great game tooo many people crying on here on how its a bad game some have valid reasons but others are just being sore losers

i spent a whole damn half an hour sitting in menus with my friend doing absoutely nothing because there was no tutorial or anything we just sat in menus for 30 minutes doing nothing wanting to play some freaking football apparently football is too much of a complicated sport for people to play on the computer this game should be called menu simulator

possibly one of the worst games i have ever played biggest load of  going i wanted to manage bristol rovers but i got ing afc telford which must stand for absolute ing  telford i got it for free but i would pay a single ing penny i wouldnt even give it to some one as a joke  joke might as well be corrupt like fifa

not as good as fm2014 but still a good game
recommended
this is the worst fm of all time i think the designers should burn in hell

it gets better every year very addictive
recommended
one of the best football management sims out there actually challenging to get a team to work properly together a proper simulation game also i love it how si still improve the game how they listen to peoples complaints about bugs on their forums and actively seek to improve their game not all companies would fully support their games for a whole year
recommended
great game its improved alot
recommended
this game is like more complicated than the real management of football and also more enjoyable although i havent managed any real team yet 
recommended
so i have played fm15 after previously having the 2013 and 2008 versions when i got my self on the 2013fm i saw a lot of changes between it and 2008 the 2015 hardly brought any changes at all there are maybe 2 or 3 new speches in team talk some more advanced conversations with players which are actualy harder to talk to and overal the personal chat has been developed yes theres also a 3d game play shown rather than 2d which actualy does not add anything to a manager expirience and in my opinion is nice but unnecesary there are few minor bugs with the game theres also a fair play requirements to get into european competitons but other than that theres not a lot of new suprises this is still my favourite football manager game but other than few little changes updated squads and competition rules this game is preety much the old 2013 manager to me its still a good game worth a buy if your upgrading your football manager 610 just because i expected a bit more new features 1010 if this is going to be your first one or much older than 2013
recommended
love this game will steal your life
recommended
takes a while to get used to but still a good game
recommended
best simulator in the universe

not the best verion of fm but certainly not the worst yes there are bugs and irritations but still playable
recommended
thoroughly enjoyable and easy to get stuck into great game for me
recommended
if people are terrible at this game they shouldnt be allowed to write reviews for it which is what 90% of the negative reviews seem to be great game so immersive and a real challenge when starting at the lower leagues 1010
recommended
great new features too add to the classic fm game

most indepth manager game i bought this game reading all the bad reviews and not expecting much but it really is an improvement if you love managing your team then this game is for you

people should learn the game before crying about it if the way you used to do things dont work maybe its time to do it differently instead of crying about it i like it im happy with it new scouting system is awesome
recommended
i have to disagree with the majority of reviews i have played the franchise for years also and i am loving this edition may be it is because i have just brought it and it has been updated but everything including the match engine have been drastically improved the injurys are nothing out of the ordanary and i am playing with arsenal goals per game are very realistic and i have had only 2 big wins out of 10 games yet i have lost only 1 friendly and the charity sheild against city which ended 20 what ever the other reviews said negitivly about this game i have seen none of so far and to think i almost took note of what people where saying and almost never brought it and i am so glad i did cdkeys sold it for 2091 and it was well worth it already didnt think i liked the dark skin and i was disappointed that it was the only one but after trying a few of the custom light skins i soon went back and love the original dark skin now my one critic so far is the pitchs look slighly blocky and not smooth enough
recommended
ive only put in about 20 hours not much considering its the fm series in the beta so far but i just feel that i have to counter these complaints about the game engine being worse for the first time since fm09 i feel that the game engine has improved from last year im not experiencing these random results at all and the goals that are scored are can almost everytime be traced to a tactical flaw or strength as opposed to fm14 where that percentage wouldve been about 50 im not experiencing this whole thing with vast amounts of goals being scoredconceded either nor the comeback issue people have been reporting i feel like these issues sound like typical beta issues remember it is a beta youve been playing that will be resolved quickly but will see either way im good corners have been improved where tactics and player attributes actually make a difference for once and it is now finally possible to score on free kicks and longshots again it was of course possible before  but not even the best players in the world would even be close to a realistically decent conversion rate
recommended
awesome game as always football manager 15 is the best fm so far  keep it up d any old fm fan should get this 
recommended
this game deserves the nobel prize well it should deserves a big awards of some sort the main reason is because of its compelling nature no one will be able to hop off the fm15 train once they have set foot in as a big football fan it is an honour that i get to play and experience one of the most intricated and dedicated football simulation ever so please if you are ever wondering what to do on a wet and stormy tuesday night the best solution is to immerse yourself into what is known as fm15
recommended
love football manager since the cm series too bad i can not use my steam wallet for in game purchase this time keep give me error code 1
recommended
fairly simple to game to play my son loves it
recommended
yes i do recommned this game yes it needs a lot of work and got back to the old style as not big fan of the side bar it is a pain to buy players offered arsenal 150m for gibbs and they said know im like whaaattttttt apprently its not a good offer dw i wasnt gonna spend that much i was just annoyed because 36mil wasnt good enough so pretty much taking the  match engine is fast but very poor at same time its they just improve what they got and stop adding new fetures in an till its compleatly right i think si will go down if they dont make it bettter

this game is just amazing  if you fan of football then buy this you will like this

i have absolutely no regret for buying this game although it is quite difficult to start with for some people it takes considerable time to delve deeply enough into this game before you can get the hang of it but the rewards are far more than you can expect as for me i totally love this game and i would encourage every football fan to try it and give it a fair shot you wont be disappointed in most cases
recommended
latest release of football manager have to say have really been enjoying it well adapted to let you to control as much or as little of the team as required new developments such as having areas that you are a appraised on as a manager are minor tweaks to the game on the surface but all put together they make some major changes also the game play when watching seems more realistic and believable than previous versions

the graphics is great it more realistic than fm 2014 the engine is great a lot of cool stuff and great look but it still like older fm and not quite change a lot there are still bugs the most thing that make me hated is the shots in a match my team scored 18 but 9 on target and 3 goals when they shot 10 6 on target and 5 goal and the second thing is injury why is injury happened a lot and crazy like 67 months 35 months 67 weeks but this game is still cool i really like this game if you like football and like manage football club i recommend you to play this for me this game is 7510

what is going on i started 2 new games and in both stoke are unbeatable now correct me if im wrong but there not a top 6 club never mind top 3  and what can i say about the defending it is a disgrace my central defenders are probably top goalscorers with all the own goals and top of the asists would be my keeper all in all a great game but still needs alot of work and theres only 4 days tto go  sort it out si
recommended
so frustating i dont know whats wrong i feel like i lost my ability to play this game i am noob all over again been playing since 2001  my team keep shooting didnt score the enemy 1 bullet to the heart and of course i lost the game  my wing back keep dribbling until byline wont cross and if he do the crosses hit enemy foot and goes corner kick frustating  my goalie is dumb enemies goalie is all neuer unbeatable i need or we all need major fixes please 
recommended
generally its a good game but there is way too many unrealistic results in the game for an example i played a game where i was man utd against spurs and i won it 107 i also think that there is scoring way too many goals by crosses and rebound goals but i also think that they have improved the game there is a lot more features in football manager 15 for an example i think that it is great that i can see my own manager skills and i also think that the jobinterviews has gotten a lot better and more realistic but there is still too many unrealistic things in the match simulator that i really hope they will improve from a scale from 110 ill give it 6 
recommended
ive put the beta version on my laptop but now ive purchased the actual game on disc but after i install the game it still says this is the beta version on the bottom left of screen  so does this mean my disc hasnt installed or how do i play the disc version
recommended
ive played most the football managers over the years and to be fair this is a big step up from fm14 which was awful i have actually got into this fm and enjoyed every minute of it i like the new press and scouting features and can see a difference with the game engine even if its small for everybody saying its awful just remeber its still a new release and comparing with last year its pretty descent i havent had the trouble of to many goals from crosses to me this game is enjoyable and fun

so i really hated this game at the beginning when it was a beta there were many errors was less realistic than the fm14 goals would be scored easily for or against you players mentality was very bad and weak that there were 4 goal comebacks everywhere however after they fixed all that the game is awesome now like always its amazing a realistic life experience for your dream job with the new feature now you feel more in control of your team how you communicate with your players and media and of course the new amazing feature of setting your style of coaching and what kind of a football manager you are which i find just brilliant and the studying for licenses as well i could go on and on for days but i wont because there is a new season about to start so get this game put on your suit and get busy

still astonishingly addictive and now the match enigne performed reasonably and as expected update i would recommend this game at the current state yeay the match engine is more polished and work as intended the ai of long shooter minded has been reduced thank you sports interactive good job what i wrote on 15 nov however the match engine is a real culprit how come i can play tikitaka feet to feet football in this fm 2015 iteration would like to recommend this game if the match engine and the artificial halfintelligence is upgraded into proper ai 1forcing me to use crossing and old kick n rush strategy to win the game which means my full back either left or right have create minimum 4 assist up until quaterhalf of the season i do love winning a game but obviously by playing beautiful football like arsenal real madrid barcelona and bayern did not a kick n rush oldish football 2 when my striker or inside forward is moving to channel rather than he passes to the team mates who has better chance to score he fires the ball and you know way above the woodwork simply dumb even when i set to shoot less often it is still often occur move into channel > shoot rather than pass > bye not a single goal my arsenal usualy have 2030 shots per game with only 58 on goal and rate of conversion below 10% 3fm 2013 match engine is better than 2015 simply said

gotta say the game has heavily improved from release completely playable and still a great game

updated after the big patch original review my first and only game review i was that  off is below i was negative ill hold my hands up now though and admit that while still not perfect the game is playable seems to be fair better balanced and without most of the big game breaking faults ive done about 8 seasons now mostly offline so forgive the lack of played hours its a decent game its not the best i still prefer fm12 and cm0102 in terms of hours played but its matured to be a decent entry cheers devs cheers tactical genius people for the mutley tweak formation cheers to you for reading i recommend the game original review im a big fan of fm games been playing since 0102 and have enjoyed many hundreds of hours of game time ive been playing fm2015 since release mostly offline i have a lot more hours than probably shown and i have more than one account this is the first time ive ever reviewed a game im doing so because its just so broken i feel i have to for every person saying the game is broken theres another saying its because of bad tactics etc well for me its just a rage inducing festival of disappointment yes theres going to be bugs yes theres going to be the odd quirk but when you reload a save and replay the same fixture a dozen times using different squads and tactics and still concede an own goal in the 90th minute after conceding an 85th minute wonder strike something is up nothing i do seems to make a difference to the evidently preplanned scoreline you could edit in the best players in the world and theyd still lose 21 to sheffield flippin wednesday everytime on my save i can live with the slightly mad bits of the game players demanding to leave then moaning when theyre transfer listed or your only expensive purchase always getting a long term injury in first half of his second match for example but when you get the impression that youre merely following a preordained set of results theres kind of no point its a terrible shame and although i expect itll all be fixed eventually its the one game i feel absolutely cheated by 30 can get you a fair bit in the steam store do think very carefully before spending it on a game that actually makes you for the first time ever angry at playing if you find otherwise if you find it to be brilliant good on you i know the developers are active in the forums trying to sort stuff out which deserves some credit but theyve got their work cut out of that much i am certain
recommended
this game is excellent
recommended
its that time of year again where sports interactive release their next installment to the football manager series and without question it is the best one yet theyve completely overhauled the ui to make it much more simplistic when nagivating and searching for vital information about your squad and club one of the biggest features to football manager 2015 is the tracksuit & suit manager this adds a roleplaying element to the game which allows you to choose your stats this will affect your team mentally and physically depending on which of the two you prefer or perhaps you want to be a mixture of both which is fine as well as minor improvements to media tactics etc theyve also improved the 3d match engine to make it more realistic with over two thousand new animations using reallife player movement capture technology it now feels like youre closer to the reallife game more than ever my verdict is this game is fantastic and if you love past football manager games im sure youll really enjoy your time with this one
recommended
i enjoyed playing this game only with a friend as it introduced a competative side to be the most succesful manager the game has improved alot over the years but the 3d animations on the pitch still looks like garbage players skate around the pitch goalies make poor attempts to save the ball and overall it just looks horrible im still keeping my fingers crossed for a football manager game that has a great looking 3d match view

still world leading soccerfootballmanager game out there however in my opinion the lack of competition in this market makes the fm crew more lazy and instead of evolving the game adding features and so on they choose to make it more user friendly for each year mainstreaming it as much as possible to get more people in to it i havent read other reviews but for me fm 2014 was bigger and better more integration with players and other managers still a great game tho with the game engine getting tho marginally better each year i guess whats annoy me is that they most likely allready have the features for fm 2018 but are saving them until they have to make bigger changes cause of competition

you know football manager is good when you suit up for the cup final
recommended
improvements made over fm2014 have made game even better and more realistic i love this series of game
recommended
i only played for about an hour but this game doesnt seem like i am going to waste 100 hours on it
recommended
i am so happy i never paid full 3000 for this game this puts me in mind of championship manager 05so many injuries penaltys the format is a joke the database is good however gonna now continue with my fm14

most addictive game i have played this franchise is so amazing
recommended
completely worth the money i have spent on it when the preorder became available i brought it since the beta i have had many saves for many people football manager isnt just a game but a way of life i started in the beta as watford manager my favourite club i played this save through the beta and in this time won the triple the prem fa cup and capital one then i moved on to a journey man save my manager had sunday league experience with no coaching badges and over the 15 year period i managed 7 clubs in 6 different leagues winning 7 pieces of silver ware then i am currently playing as stevenage manager with the aim to make the club selfsufficient with currently being in 2026 and one every competition i have been in in the last 4 years would be 5 but thanks to arsenal i lost the fa cup moving onto the game going from fm14 where i have over 760 hours the ui was very different seeing the task bar moving from the top to the side was very weird but unlike first thought takes up less room as well as makes tasks easier personally i dont use skins but with the community out there finding a perfect skin is easy with badges and kits i always mod the game in this particular side although when i first loaded the game i was happy to see nearly every league had the kits and badges except for germany and the english premier league due to licenses the match engine is extremely better than the previous years and this makes the game so much better with the fm community the badges kits and more is available to combat the license issues with finding regens and making them world class you can easily create bonds with the players overall i have over 1150 hours playing this beautiful game and i have extremely enjoyed the game and will continue to enjoy fm15 for many of the players they will agree football manager is a way of life this game is completely worth its price from regen hunting where you look for good young players to develop to just straight up winning games if you love football this game is for you

just like the rest of the fms they just keep getting a tad better each year only thing is for a yearly update and just a mild upgrade im not sure why it costs so much after all these years of cm and fm i might finally start doing an everyother year purchase just so im a bit more impressed and not spending so much on mild upgrades

when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold dyes and ivory take my advice ready all your tanks and nukes arm them and shoot them like your life depends on it they are evil traitorous demons never trust them however genghis khan is my best friend he came up to me and was all like de full do bu la chi mendo and i said okay lets be friends i can never understand that guy but something about our relationship just works ghandi hating simulator 2014 1110

gandhi declares war on bismarcks german empire soon after gandhi strikes berlin hamburg and essen with nuclear missiles the ottomans concerned with gandhis warmongering denounce the indian leader they soon lose their capital bismarck his economy and army in ruins pleads for peace with the indian empire but gandhi will only stop with full annexation of the german reich an alliance of poland gengis khans mongolian empire and the aztecs turn on gandhi in hopes of stopping his rampage warsaw falls karakorum falls tenochtitlan falls gandhi reins supreme the world is in his grasp he is on the verge of doing what men for thousands of years have dreamed of conquering the world under one banner but none of that matters because the babylonians have just won a space victory by launching a single little rocket into space it makes too much sense 1010 but be warned gandhi will find you gandhi will kill you and gandhi always gets his kill
recommended
civ 5 is the kind of game where you can try to be nice and befreind everyone but you will get denounced they will murder your people and pillage your cities when you attempt to fight back you are labeled a warmonger and obviously the only way to stop getting warmonger penalties is to slaughter all those that oppose you right if you destroy 1 civ might as well destroy them all because they will not let you live that down also ghandi destroyer of worlds will wreck you if you dont give him all your uranium for him to build nukes to nuke you with 1010 would fight ghandi destroyer of worlds again

a typical scenario every civilization player will experience i the great general washington led my courageous troupe of yanks to victory after victory  our muskets were far more advanced then anything our foes could muster moments after wresting control of a pitiful citystate i am alerted to the sudden appearance of a man  coated in war paint made of buffalo feces clad in nothing more than a loincloth  who brandishes his bronze spear at me and proceeds to launch a barrage of nuclear missiles at new york 1010 i failed history class because of this game

if youre new to civlization this is where to start everything is simplified for the better even if youre new to stradegy it has a lot of difficulty settings this is one of the best most complete stradegy games once you buy its 2 expansion packs gods & kings  brave new world not needed but recommended there are 5 different types of victory they are cultural domination space misson 2055 and diplomatic they are all fun to go for this is a stragey with some thinking involved and a lot of mapgame options and great mods are on the workshop so you could end up with hundreds and hundreds of hours eventually withnout noticing basically you start in anicents times and settle your first city with nothing you have to then guide your cilization to stand `the test of time` right through to da future only one civilization can be victorious so aim for victory ahead of everyone else there is multiplayer but i prefer not to stick to that due to people not finishing games a standared game can last litterly a full day recommended to anyone who hasnt played civlization
recommended
good game needs more stalin
recommended
i did all i could to be peaceful i then got nuked by gandhi im not sure if that says something about me or the game anyways yeah

the first time i tried civ at a friends place the smooth start followed by a rush of adrenaline and a wave of pleasant warmth washing over my body the mouse trembles between my fingers and drops to the floor with a tink rolling away from my feet as my eyes pull back into my head thoughts bounce around the inside of my skull at a madmans pace you alright man i hear somebody whispering behind me they might as well be worlds away for just an hour or two i was god and just like that a cold snap of clarity whips across my consciousness and brings me back to the world of the living my vision has not yet adjusted to the darkness of the room a feeling of emptiness swallows me whole ii want more laughter echoes off the grimy stucco walls youll get another wait your turn friend i am standing opening the door walking out of the room but my body remains in that chair a shell of myself will always be in that chair as i passed through the doorway and was assaulted by the bright light of an austrian afternoon my friends greeted a ghost and escorted him to their car how was it man is it is crazy as they say are you going to try it again youre wild dude i just stare off into the distance and think about the sound that mouse made when it hit the ground tink i wish i could go back there and pick it up civ not even once
recommended
what else to say than just one more turn the legendary seriesfranchisetimeconsumingvoid that is civilization continues to conquer the hearts of all us wouldbe world leaders who lacks the ambition and are too lazy to strive for power outside of the digital realm to ascertain whether or not to play civilization there is really only one question you need ask yourself how many days off can i afford before getting fired if the answer is below five you should probably leave now im serious leave anyhow if you have never before played civilization you owe it to yourself to try it you will not regret it except for when you get fired of course it is simply aweinspiringly brilliant an epic journey through history rewriting history

nuked japan while germany watches grabbing a hold of rome as their precious ally turns into dust before their very eyes germany looks to rome and asks them to push their giant death robots towards my capital dubbed temple prime obvious reference the robots march their way into a mountainous area where a wall of mountain protects several missile launcher platforms mrls basically who launch a barrage at them rome pulls back the robots but then whats this an army of xcom soldiers rip the poor robots to shreds the robot survivor reported to rome that russia has taken over the middleeastern regions and pushed toward europe with rome being the meat shield of germany caesar looks at his ally and goes wait what and was suddenly silenced when a reign of nuclear warheads wipe out his only defending army cities tremble under russian troops who then surround the german capital germany goes and askes if there can be peace catherine then gives out a lol nope then proceeds to demolish the capital with its main army on the other side of the continent great game nice ai interesting terrain awesome gameplay

so finally nearly 600 hours in civi v and finally i believe i can give it a fair review so lets get the obv out of the way is civi v good  yes otherwise i wouldnt have spent 600 hours in it and still booting it up now and then civi v lacks nothing on graphics or gameplay it is top of the line and there it is 100s of mods for those who wishes to change their gameplay in anyway possible civi v is not as detailed or brutally hard as the former games in this installment however that is a great thing in my eyes as it gets a lot of new players to test out the series that the rest of us have enjoyed for so many years the dlc`s gods & kings and brave new world adds a lot of the things we are use to from ealier series and is diffenetly worth getting for anyone who likes the more complex version of the civi series that beeing said the other dlc`s is mainly just new maps or new nations to play with and really only something you should pickup if you are a huge fan or on sale so civi is as it always have been you start with a settler and one more unit and here you go form a nation that will stand the test of time there is multiple ways to achive victory and it is important that you play to your nations strenghts and use your enemies weaknesses through the different time periods of our planet this is classic civi after all tho do not let it fool you civi is a game that takes a long time often 6 hours pr map and often one nation is just gonna hate you more than anyone else in my case it was poland wich wanted to nuke and kill me no matter what they did a good job sometimes too all in all a great game and a great installment of the civi series that brings a lot of new players and a lot of life into the series so if you like complex games that takes time and patience then make sure you pick it up

id appreciate it if you checked out my blog where i do reviews giveaways and more httpsgandhigamingwordpresscom note this review includes the brave new world addon it makes the game alot better trust me alexander the great greece reviews the components needed to make the spaceship he notices that he needs the engine but doesnt have the proper technology to obtain this piece for a scientific victory angered at this he asks his remaining friends for some research agreements to get the tech he needs to win he gets two from his friends ramkhamhaeng did i spell that right anyway siam and also pedro ii brazil but it wouldnt go into effect for about 30 turns alex just groans and begins to switch up his productions and his science so he can aim toward getting that engine oda nobunaga japan then begins to take down ramesses iis egypt last city which was his capital siam gets angered by seeing that oda is taking down all of their allies and attempts to charge at him japan was able to sweep his army and destroyed all of his cities with his deadly ability where wounded units still fight at full strength pedro ii sends a spy to odas capital to see where he will strike next him or alex alex and pedro set up some defenses and attempt to build a wall to defend themself from this unstoppable force oda decides to hit pedro first and slowly takes down all of his cities one by one and took down rio de janeiro the greek forces began to hold the enemy marines and paratroopers off after a successful ambush by an xcom unit alexander had some time to finish up the engine technology the next turn sparta and all of the other cities besides athens were destroyed by odas unstoppable force however right when oda was about to charge in and destroy greece both research agreements were used and got the technology needed alex quickly moved all his units away from athens and used his remaining gold to purchase the engine it was pricey but he was able to attach it to the spaceship japanese units were closing in fast and the greek soldiers started dying quickly but right when the artillery was about to fire they all see the glorius sight of a spaceship flying in the sky and going to space oda looks at the spaceship and starts yelling in defeat knowing that he lost to greece with a scientific victory right when they were about to get a domination victory in civilization v or civ those events are actually pretty common it takes a little while to get used to but once you get into it it becomes very addictive to the point you havent slept in days yep days my head is pretty rotten right now from playing this but god you need this game if you got to purchase any game on steam for free make it this just buy it you will love it and i guarantee it even if the ai can be annoying but yeah just friggin buy it why are you still reading this why havent bought this game yet gandhi is going to nuke you so hard he could just whack hello gandhi here you better buy this game or else im willing to nuke you and your cities and your family and your friends and everyone you know and just about everyone else on this planet 1110

arguably the best strategy game to ever come to steam due to the amount of content and endless replay value  in the verge of winning cultural victory until gandhi napoleon and alexander the great declared war against me in the last minute got angry and ended up wiping out the entire planet with nuclear weapons and unintentionally dominated the world with military might dont fck with me 1010  you may encounter genghis khan during your civilization experience and hell be your best friend even if your civilization doesnt have the great military strength also has a cool personality and usually got your back in the midst of trouble bestfriends4life 9510  want to do a historical reenactment with your selected civilizations go ahead it may be historically inaccurate but you ended up enjoying a lot more than you originally intended 910  dont have any allies with other civilizations you can gift a unit or send gold to citystates to become your friends and allies at least youre not lonely in a hostile world where everyone can backstab you like a sneaky btch im looking at you gandhi hey its a good thing when citystates will fight and die for you 8510 theres something wrong when you have the freedom ideology and ended up dominating most of the planet by the information era 8510  in the middle of war you would most likely hear depressing orchestral soundtrackand ended up making peace with your enemies not because that you lost interest in war or you feel bad for wiping out enemy units and annexing cities its because the soundtrack will make your heart cry 1010  the best political simulator ever 1010 with endless replay value and unlimited ways to deal with your friends and foes in a hostile world civilization is still considered as the gamers cocaine from many owners who own the franchise still dont have the game go get civilization v or genghis khan and i will declare war against you

civ 5 is a game where you are the leader of a civilization obviously you can destroy your foes in a domination victory with your army you can use education and science to win in a science victory or maybe try for a different victory whether your more of a warmongering player or a peaceful player civ 5 is a great game to play with friends family or maybe just randoms you can make allies enemies or maybe just friends that may or may not backstab you with other civilizations you can explore the world and settle more cities to expand your civilization more research technologies to unlock more features make money by trading luxury resources and other stuff and make wonders that will help your civilization in different ways the game is also newbfriendly as the guiders will help you grow your civilization through your first and upcoming journies if youve played the previous civs youre probably going to like civ 5 the dlc brave new world makes civ 5 a whole lot better such as it completely changes culture victories which makes it more interesting and fun overall to acomplish a culture victory it adds more civilizations and wonders and changes the way you make money by actually making you make trade routes with other civilizations or citystates to make money however the vanilla game without dlc is still pretty good i personally believe the game and dlc is worth the money overall i rate this game 1010
recommended
perfect thing to waste whole your life

created a city as a military holdout base in a secluded area surrounded by mountains with only 1 population in it for the entire game 1110 would not do that again
recommended
this is the first turnbased strategy game ive ever played so be aware that this review does not come from a connoisseur at first the game can be very intimidating you have no real idea what to do and you just go with the flow you soon realize the mistake youve done as you get crushed by your opponents after a couple of games versus the ai you start the comprehend the way you should go about playing and the game starts shining its very fun to play alone ive personally never played against another person and theres no timer or anything forcing you to rush and make irrational decisions so its very relaxing theres a lot of different countries you can play as each one having different traits to bring to the table making it refreshing to play over and over to try different play styles believe me you might say  just one more turn  but we all know youre lying to yourself

this game gave me a boner

one of the best 4x turnbased strategy games yet made deep and enjoyable particularly with gods and kings and brave new world expansions

i love to nuke ghandi in this game bacause he is a warmonger  rhymes with punt

its all fun and games until gandi starts sending missionaries over the next thing you know hes knocking at your door with his false promises of friendship and his army of missionaries carrying nukes you want to start that awesome new religion bejebus cheist hindu missionaries want to get rid of the hinduism religion thats spreading throughout your cities hindu missionaries you want to spread bejebus cheist to delhi hindu missionaries with nukes gandi dont mess around

i played 38 hours my first day

one day while i was walking down a serene path i encountered a grave evil that i myself could not have possibly defeated alone there they were the great khan and the great ghandi marching side by side down a path towards my empire i the great paccal of course could not let this great transgression aside so i talked to my great correspondent frezdful calfrul and asked him for holy advice he by smoking a green plant and drinking the blood of sheep had great premonitions and then told me only by sacrificing my relatives that i could defeat the great evil headed towards my empire my unbreakable belief in my correspondent lead me to an awakened power deep within the bottom half of my body and there i was flaying my relatives and sacrificing them towards the great sun king this of course manifested a great power within myself i became ferrocia the great lizard king i uttered a few words feerotoa aoiasjiogjoiasj and by doing those measly acts i increased my kingdoms science output to >9000 and construction to >9000 and built many troops over my 5 city large empire truly it was something to behold  as i built an army of xcom and death robots to shatter the power my opponents held they were at my mercy and that is the story of me the great gozz

can anyone tell me how i can tell when this game is over ive been looking for the boss for a few years now and havent seen hide nor hair of him im about ready to give up on but need a few thousand more hours to complete level v

my favorite part of history was when ghandi built the great wall in 4000 bc for his jewish army 1010 helped me with history class
recommended
lacks a little depth compared to its predecessor and the ai is beyond stupid in battle but this game remains a fanstastic strategy title and a good introduction for newcomers to the series
recommended
theres something deeply wrong with ghandis ai the fact that he nukes everyone when he gets the chance makes this the most accurate representation of historical events on steam

great time consuming game hours of fun

civilization the bread and butter of turnbased strategy games the absolute pinnacle of eyeneedling backbreaking thousand upon thousand of turns over the course of what i think are the longest games youll ever play the only game thats longer than a civ marathon game is life itself as a huge pirate player of civ4  expansions i must say i am pleasently surprised with civ5 i though it was lacking the depth the fourth had but in reality its just overall better everything probably due to the fact that death stacks are no longer in the game  910 strategy  if youre a fan of anything that involves tactics macromanaging resourcemanagement general strategy youll feel at home in this game everything is so smooth and straightforward youll be dying to pass the test of time and try your best to emerge victorious as the greatest civilization skill roof is damn high and its one of those games thats hard to master definitely a collosus of the strategy community cons ai in the game is barely pottytrained it just follows a given route most of the time and its painstakingly predictable once you played a lot  810 multiplayer  awarded a 75 because multiplayer as a concept for this gameis impossible without dedication and a group of friends to meetup around the clock at various points during a week to pick up on the last save its hard to set up but boy its so much fun really worth going for multi singleplayer rocks a lot if you dont manage to find friends cons time consuming difficult to maintain a game or find people who will  1010 game mechanics  combat and tactics are just so satisfying compared to old civ games tech advances are meaningful territorial management makes you feel like you own your civilization balance is properly set with the exception of the spawn roulette that will obviously give random locations with random benefits and resources maps are great modding community went to space and theres a lot to be imported from their work learning curve can go through your regular linear graphs everything is intuitive and easy to learn one game that has a whole lot of depth cons havent found any negatives on the game mechanic side  910 ui and graphic style  everything is smooth as butter the devteam have done a great job with this game and everything is polished graphic style fits beautifully with the nature of the game and it doesnt distract you from the important part the game itself cons i would love to have more data and info instead of this minimalism but thats just me  dlcs arent that great the only real advantage for me would be the modding community that usually moves fast towards modding the expansions cons dlcexpansions they cost money and divide the community  big fan of this game and the series few games have managed to make me wish for one more turn until the sun rose the second day and my clock showed me 7 am and this is one of those games the great heir to the previous stellar game and i recommend it to anyone with any of the following  time on his hands  great love for strategy  great love for turnbased games  some playful love of history  friends you can play with  money to spare check discounts if possible     9  10

civilization v wasnt played in a day at least its good for curing insomnia though edit truth be told the game can only appeal to gamers with a lot of patience the way the turn based gameplay unfolds its just too damn slow and boring and its that much worse if you want to go aggresive with the grind that moving units around turn after turn is after i beat it on deity i decided that was it for me never loading this one up again i got other stuff to play

updated 2014 originally i said in my review in 2011 pretty good but lacking a lot of features from civ iv reminds me more of a remake of civ ii at its core still as super addictive as the rest of the franchise with a few new twists lots of dlcs to waste your money on too fast forward to 2014 with more than a few hundred hours played under my belt the game is officially complete with multiple small dlcs & balancefix patches plus the 2012 & 2013 feature expansions in gods & kings and brave new world which have significantly changed the gameplay there are now a massive number of civilizations to choose too not to mention a massive number of tailored scenarios to challenge you the major expansions particularly have really rounded the game off nicely reintroducing many of the earlier missed features from civ iv introduced more new things like world congress advanced trade routes tourism & cultural great works to complement previously missing features like religion & espionage along with this content there was also balancing out all civilization victory paths providing some unique gameplay options to explore there remains a more simplified approach to all of this streamlining many features meaning less micro management this does make the game more accessible to newer players but in some ways feels perhaps too simplified now it would have been good to still have more advanced micro management for those that are up to the challenge although more simplified game design you will find more things to keep you busy more end game content for example to cover those dull periods where things become stagnent then there is off course the huge number of achievements to unlock many of which offer a true challenge and sometimes a bit of luck overall even 4 years on from my first game it is a game i always end up going back to that is rare in the current generation of disposable gaming it is the most enjoyable & rewarding strategy game around bar none just one more turn

i had a family once a life then i discovered civilization 5 come outside daddy its snowing my child would say in a minute honey id reply monty is threatening me with war unless i meet his demands and i cant look weak in front of byzantine weeks passed centuries my empire had grown large powerful i had it all in the palm of my hand the pyramids had rose before me the secrets of the nuclear age were but a click before my command my people were happy lively i had created not a kingdom but an existence but alas all things must come to an end the wife got sick of me not paying attention to her the kids had already grown up and started going to school i checked my hours on steam 4102 hours on record nothat cant be right i announced loudly i arose from the chair my sweat had partially ruined the leather seating at this point and the smell made her gag i begged pleaded please i love you we all make mistakes take me backright after i finish this last turn one turn my army was in place for the final strike all enemies friends allies would fall with this one swoop all i needed was one final turn it was my legacy my life my dedicationor my family in the end looking back i believe i made the right choice civ 5 is a hell of a good game after all and love comes and goes much easier than an alliance with austria that doesnt end in a backstab

this is a pretty good game when you want to retell history so that the aztecs ed over the germans and then the united states joined forces with the russian queen pretty good i like hurting history books

civilization v is great id definitely recommend this game to everyone also buy the expansions for more fun enjoy xd
recommended
civilization games keep getting better and better civilization v is the latest and arguably the greatest in the series lots of leaders to pick from and every expansion has added a lot of depth to the game with several victory conditions and different civilizations with their own strengths and weaknesses to choose from replayability is endless playing with friends in a ffa against ais civs for hours at a time is also fun highly recommended if youre a turnbased strategy fan
recommended
this game is just perfect as a total war veteran i was a bit put off by the lack of tws real time combat i thought that id loose interest in managing a single map well i was wrong this game is so amazing that even if theyd scrap the combat entirely id still love it being my first civilization game i found it really easy to get into and enjoy the expansions are great too although i didnt have much time to play brave new world yet i wholeheartedly recommend this game to veteran strategy fans and newcomers to the genre alike

dwarved by the expectations of featurehungry fans and a remarkably successful history the civilization series is one of the last bastions of traditional turnbased 4x strategy games perhaps acting as the sole major life support for an increasingly whittling genre in retrospect it is a game that initially failed on many fronts upon launch it was rightly heavily criticised for underperforming in many aspects that civ 4 had proudly refined  trading religion and diplomacy amongst others however with the addition of both expansions brave new world and gods and kings civ 5 recovered most of the features it had lost or underdelivered on regardless issues regarding bugs illogical ai poor performance online connectivity issues and abusively priced dlc remain open wounds to this very day firaxis has now had 4 years to deal with at least some of the games remaining problems but have instead neglected them preferring to focus on civilization beyond earth overlooking the aforementioned issues however will reveal a deep rewarding well paced game in which planning ahead is rewarded with the chance to steamroll enemy civilisations victories can be achieved either using culture tourism science military force or diplomacy laying the groundwork for daylong matches that can twist and turn whilst simultaneously providing endless intrigue machiavellian scheming and gargantuan military campaigns rushing to build the next world wonder is often equally as thrilling as pillaging a hostile citys tiles whilst trading with allied civilisations for emergency gold supplies in order to purchase those last few bombers needed to take the heavily fortified city should you prefer to take a more littlefingeresque approach spies can steal technology manipulate voting and even provide political intrigue and military intelligence embargoes can cripple tradebased economies even international congress votes can be traded for luxuries resoruces and cities allegiances are frequently earned and lost ensuring the game is never predictable and with the seemingly endless policies technologies units and ways to turn your initial settlers into a sprawling international empire civilisation 5 provides plenty of replayability to be a staple of your gaming time for years just bare in mind that if you want to get the most out of the game you will absolutely have to read its builtin wiki to make up for the needlessley steep learning curve and often infuriating lack of vital information
recommended
if you dont like going outside you dislike having friends and want to either be nuked by ghandi and his legion of death robots or conquer the world as ghandi this is the game for you if you want to rewrite history and lead atilla and his huns to religious dominance by founding christianity as a peaceloving people this is the game for you if you want to find out what itd be like if a civilization had discovered how to make rifles and tanks while everyone else on the planet is still waving pointy metal sticks at each other this is the game for you if none of these things apply to you youre probably dead inside and even then this is still the game for you

when i was a young lad attending school a friend of mine approached me he said hey do you play civilization v feeling insulted by the lower life form i took a  on his chest and began repeatedly punching him in the throat as i did this i came to the realization that i did not in fact play civilization v seeking to correct this miscalculation i walked to my house and purchased the game after playing a few matches i knew i was destined to be the civilization v champion what does this story mean you ask well it means that you may look at the screenshots of this game and see some worthless crap but if you purchase it youll realize the true meaning of friendship that  isnt meant to be plopped on someones chest but rather in a toilet so stop  on that gentlemens torso put that  where it belongs and purchase civilization v its a pretty good game

this is a game where you kick in the door to your cave and tell everyone to stop sucking their own  for a ing second so you can get some real  done then you meet genghis khan or some other   and they ask for all your ing whales well theyre my whales genghis so get your own ing whales once everyone pops their  out of their mouths and genghis s off back home to build a thousand horses you can tell your dudes to build  like ing roads and ing libraries and ing circuses and all other kinds of awesome  nobody had ever dreamed of before you then you tell them to build some in thing like a giant statue of an awesome guy or balance some ing rocks together because everyone for the rest of ing time will remember that time that legendary king of men balanced some ing rocks together and just as youre about to unveil it some mother ing  piece of   on the other side of the ing world finishes balancing some ing rocks together and everyone remembers him forever  you ghandi and then you nuke the  out of thousands of years in the future now nobody has any ing rocks are you happy ghandi eventually you will nuke the entire world or drown in horses and then you start a new game and eventually your brain tricks you into thinking you stopped playing and went back to work but you never did robert youre still playing civ 5 right now wake up wake up wake up wak

sid meier really is a crazy guy he divided the world into hexagons to make this hexagon warfare simulator peter molyneux mustve rolled in his grave when he saw this anyway this is civilization v which is a game where you have a city and then it expands and you steamroll other cities its more of a colonialism game but then only people who look back on colonialism fondly use the word civilization what bugs me here is that indias leader is gandhi so when i built loads of trebuchets and annexed paris my brain literally exploded into tiny pieces because i couldnt comprehend it either way gandhis likeness is pretty well imagined here much better than ben kingsleys weirdly long head good hexagonal tessellation game

play the game mod the game read guides on the game play the game some more this has become one of my favorite games if you love history or like strategy games or both like me than do yourself a favor and pick this game up pros good graphics detailed leaderscenes simple enough mechanics to grasp in a few hours but complex enough to take a few hundred hours to master i have nearly 600 hours and im still learning new stuff and mastering old stuff good variety of fairly balanced civs a lot of civs have unique and fun playstyles like venice only having 1 city but double trade routes polynesias incredible naval recon and warfare and brazils amazing modgame tourism output come to mind good amount of history to learn its also made me look at other cultures hawaiian and plainsnative americans completely different and made me more interested in them great mods ever want to conquer north korea as beavis and butthead or patrick star you can do that the modding community is not as awesome as civ ivs but its still amazing ximicacan ximicacan ximicacan cons serious con vanilla civ v isnt that great the game becomes truly great with its expansion packs so try to buy the complete edition if you can unit variety could use some major work it just doesnt feel right using polynesian trebuchets mayan frigates and zulu crossbowmen etc tech tree isnt quite as expansive as in civ iv some civs are just boring and uninteresting like america or iroquois game has made me neglect my other games

> alexander started hating me for being a friend to his enemies and then ended up denouncing me to the world > after a few turns i had enough of his crap and took over every single city he owned > a moment later i felt sort of sorry for him > as a merciful ruler i gave him a tiny crappy city in the south pole of the world > he was still flipping me off > destroyed his city and eliminated his units > he was never seen or heard from ever again you could have just bought the game but instead decided to waste your time on reading this unnecessary review thank you anyway  910 the best strategy game on steam

definitely the most engaging strategy game i have ever played but it is not for everyone to start off with the cons this game will take a couple hundred hours to learn to a decent level and if you are considering buying it do yourself a favor and buy at least the brave new world dlc with it or you will be missing about half of the game and will have to deal with an unnacceptably broken combat system also the multiplayer servers are extremely unreliable it is very difficult to play out a full game with random players if everyone in the game is your friend you can save the game regularly and reinvite everyone when it crashes unlike most strategy games civilization v is much more than simply military confrontationcombat every player leads one of histories civilizations from the start of time when military combat is limited to club warriors and ancient archers and your empire consists of a single small undeveloped town until the information era by which time the players in the lead would have nuclear weaponry modern armor helicopter gunships internet and stealth fighters and your civilization could have over a dozen cities each up to 50 times larger than your original village the success of your civilization depends not only on your battlefield prowess although it is a necessary component but in your ability to build your civilizations economy science and culture faster than your neighboring civilizations and in keeping your civilizations population happy a serious setback in any of these parameters will affect all of them and will allow other civilizations in the game to bypass you and eventually either destroy you or win peacefull through science culture or diplomacy a major positive about the game especially in singleplayer is the diversity of the strategies you can use with each particular civilzation usually suited only to one or two win conditions

civilization a series of computer games as synonymous with turnbased strategy as the old tabletop board game risk i got to play the original civilization in its hayday on an old ibm using dos to fire it up in wonder the following seven nights were spent doing nothing but playing civ and civilization 5 embodies nearly all of the same traits and innovations that made the original so great ive spent a couple hundred hours last year in civ5 with gods & kings and loved every minute i recently purchased the newest expansion but havent completely explored the additional gamemechanics much since even after this long im still trying to master to base games mechanics and the religion that gods and kings introduced but overall civ5 is the turnbased strategy game to currently end all turnbased strategy games if youve never played a civilization game before thats just fine civ5 can be a perfect introduction to turnbased strategy or if youve played all the previous games nearly to death like i have this game will completely kickdown the door to almost everything you wanted from the other games the hexagon tiles took a little bit of getting used to for me but since its something i remember from the first big tabletop games i ever played i dont mind it at all and think it adds a bit of an old school feeling to the board there are a few hangups in the animations  unit movements aircraft orders need an overhaul because they drastically tie up your time in late game in comparison to any other unit but other than that graphically civ5 is beautiful and the board features and resources are about as detailed and distinct as your computer can handle the sound and music is immersive and high quality as you might expect from an alist sid meier game the interface and controls are almost perfect in my opinion a couple datacharts are a little bit buried down through the menus but i cant really complain about that since even buried down in the menus at worst only means 2 or 3 layers into readily accessible options anyway so nothing is very far away testament to the games refined user interface i think would be the fact that many gamers have easily played civ5 with a consolegaming style controller with the upcoming steambox livingroom pc and thats definitely saying something substantial when talking about as complex a turnbased strategy game as civ5 ultimately id say this would go on my top 10 of all time definitely worth purchasing and supporting the developers who brought it to us

with many games more and more emphasizing adrenalinepumping action playing a slower paced strategy game like civilization can be refreshing indeed civilization v is the kind of game you can sit down popcorn and soda in hand and become completely engrossed in political crises border tensions and epic battles while it may not train your reflexes or aiming abilities youll certainly find yourself performing insane feats of balance as you try to maintain your civilizations military defense culture scientific advancement religious development and economic power youll find a game that is admittedly not immediately exciting but which will involve the player in incredibly complex situations never playing out the same way each time always offering a new story however there are some valid criticisms worth considering i will address two primary problems with the game that are connected to smaller issues others have brought up firstly much depth and complexity present in civilization iv has been stripped from the game and it shows in civilization iv leaders acted very often according to their historical personalities  gandhi would have an aversion to war wheras genghis khan might be attracted to the possibility  in civ v gandhi will happily crush your entire country to seize your spice resources the hostility and viciousness of the ai in civ v by contrast detracts from the games believability besides the hostility of the computer players they are also gloriously stupid they make insane trade offers demand whole cities in wartime when they are losing and capitulate in war when they have the advantage as deep and involving as the game is the ai manages to detract from the experience often enough to be worth mentioning the second criticism worth considering is that too often it breaks the spell of depth and plays more like a strategy game it is a strategy game yes but the game is also about civilization and how complex and wonderfully intertesting human society can be and sometimes the play to win mentality that is inherent in the game especially its ai as well as many of the players can weaken the games ability to absorb the player into the story of human civilization beyond these criticisms the game presents itself well the interface is much cleaner compared to previous iterations in the series and the warfare much more interesting in previous titles units could be stacked on top of one another so often the winning of wars came down to who had the most material power to build the biggest unit stacks as a result of the removal of unit stacking material power will help but an ability to position units correctly and actually strategize will win you the battle even in the event you are outnumbered thus civilization v may rightly boast of having the best combat and warfare the series has seen however shallow the game can be at its worst its intensely engaging and dramatic in the most positive sense at its best  every action that is simple or basic in one game is dramatically important in civilization for example moving units close to another civilizations borders somewhat tedious and uninteresting at face value raises the tension as you prepare for an epic war against their evil imperialistic civilization in the context of world civilizations all actions become pronounced and important  helping the game tell a story of warring global civilizations in crisis rather than simply telling the story of a competitive match between two players each trying to win that dramatic worldly context is what allows the game to tell such interesting new stories upon each playthrough and definitely what makes the game so incredibly addicting involving and engaging despite the admittedly valid criticisms i couldnt possibly recommend this game more

firstly and most importantly i have never played a civ game before secondly the first time i sat down and played civilization v i played for almost 8 hours consecutively the game is that addictive and i havent had that kind of hook on a game for years there are many ways to play and ultimately be the best civilization the game might look unappealing and boring to some but the game is really easy to understand yet extremely deep at the same time im mostly an fps person but this game is some of the most fun ive had playing a game ever
recommended
i believe this game is great but many would disagree its the marmite of gaming up there with the well known monopoly board game its massively time consuming your friends will get angry if you keep asking them to play and you have to be a diehard fan of this form of game to bear with its tedious time consuming yet magnicificant piece of gaming masterpieces but it proves to me and many others as a shining beacon of which pulls you away from the painful dull and necessary work of life and into the gaping greatly lit tunnel of procrastination and determination to those ready to civ i salute you

higgsfamily09 is a big fan of civilization we got three four and five  this one has some problems but in all it a great game if you are new to the game get this one it is user friendley love all the new leaders and civilization this game has  the graphics are great so do i recommend this game yes i do it is a great game fun to play the multiplayer is easy to learn

due to the fact i havent written any reviews for a long time i feel it is about time i started again with this unanimously magnificent strategy title what civilization v constitues is the climax of a renowned series to begin with it looks stunning and its world shines with beautiful and well designed environments futhermore when you start immersing yourself deeper inside its universe you will begin discovering more of its many virtues not only has this game one of the most sophisticated ingame mechanisms i have ever seen in a strategy title but also it can maintain your interest for years trying to offer a detailed insight into civ v could easily make me write pages over pages though i dont want to become tiresome just keep in mind that this game needs patience in order to unfold all its features on the whole i have no doubt that especially stategy friends are going to adore it

sid meiers civilization v is a 4x turnbased strategy from 2k games once you start playing this you cant stop civilization v is just a good game it has one more turn factor which makes you want to keep playing even when you already won sid meiers civilization v has very deep and challenging gameplay you start from scratch with only a settler and a warrior build your first capital city then keep building up your nationempire from the dark age of 4000 bc the dawn of human civilization to the modern globalization age of 2000 ad you forge your empire from a single capital city and then expand and build more city do research to strengthen your empire in all aspect create military power for defense purpose or go on a global conquest and manage your national economy culture and diplomacy with other faction every unit can be leveled up just like an rpg games which make every unit is unique and count you can even rename those unit when they level up to make them a little more personal choose your own path for your civilization war peace culture science all will lead you to great victory sid meiers civilization v has good graphics quality overall the maps are beautiful unit and city has quite good detail the ui is also great you can switch between tactical and world map view this game is very great and addicting sometimes which is most of the times even if you already won the game you still continue playing it i recommend this rating 910

theres no other game quite like it even eu ivck has a lower learning curve in comparison but its still a sizable beast to conquer there are lots of intricate mechanics and strategies you can find yourself learning hundreds of hours into the game oh and it takes forever to finish a game even on quick so if youre the impatient type this game may not be for you unless you go duelquick every game mp is fun ai becomes much too predictable so introducing the unpredictability of human thinking into the equation naturally mixes things up the team mechanics for coop are interesting at first but besides sharing beakers for research there really isnt much to it and you often end up fighting for things like wonders land and citystates like any competitor would also no achievements can be unlocked through mp except the one which is mindboggling as someone who dislikes the ai it is annoying having to jump back into sp to get the achievements i would otherwise have received through normal play balance wise there are some aspects that could be improved there are obviously superior wonders civs even resources im looking at you salt as well as obviously inferior ones like angkor wat denmark and most of the plantation luxuries some units also have pretty crappy ugprade routes  pikeman the most accessible and strongest medieval melee unit suddenly becomes an atbest situational anticavalry lancer and the crossbowman also the most accessible and strongest medieval ranged unit becomes a one range gatling gun range is huge in this game so increasing the damage in compensation for the lost one tile of range is like cutting someone then offering them a bandaid technical specifications wise the graphics are a nice upgrade from iv and for a game released in 2010 its fair some of the music is pretty awesome but theyre easily forgettable and as i already listen to other music while im playing turning off the music hasnt impacted me at all all in all a 910 i know most of my review has been negative but anything not mentioned here i generally endorse these were some more pedantic gripes and very subjective so as always take everything with a massive mound of salt those op ers ps obligatory one more turn

it is always fun to play but not alwaya easy to win the two major add ons make the game much more difficult and enjoyable if on sale the game is a steal and will be for years to come even with new civs on the horizon

conquer the world outsmart the world outculture the worldthere are so many ways to play the game before i start i just wanted to say that its a very slow game it takes lots of hours to finish single games this doesnt necessary mean anything bad but a lot of people want quick paced games so just wanted to give a warning you build your civilization from the bottom to the end you make deals with your neighboring civs and conquer others or do whatever it takes to be the dominant civ build an empire pro the god of replayability tons of ways to play and win beutiful graphics decent ai with different personalities gandhi con very time consuming annoyingly slow loading screens if you are interested in the game make sure to grab the dlcsexpansions aswell to make the game as fun as possible

civilization v is the newest installment in the series and is perfect for someone new to it such as myself from what i have seen civ5 seems much more suitable for newcomers with a less overly complicated ui and overall gameplay its not too simple though as 70 hours in im still using new tactics by using new aspects of the game to reach my goal this is the best strategy game i have ever played and without potentially 100s of hours of content with dozens of civs maps randomization mods and more this is a game i would recommend for anyone strategy fan or not easily a 1010 a gem of a game

civilization 5 a game that made me feel irate and hate a lot of nations this is a game about building a kingdom and acquiring fame or in my case fear because i always ran in from the rear and torched the enemies buildings where upon i was quickly botched and murdered while me mate john watched it certainly requires tactics which fills my gaping cassum of desires like a big bottle of cider this type of gameplay is simple and soothing like a plane pilot before screaming mayday at least at first before youre cursed and find yourself coerced into huge wars that go on longer than my drinking at any bars with multiples nations that dont have much hesitation one awkward gaze and youll be bashed into a haze by five of the loons when youre just armed with a pair of spoons but with some mates in sight things became alright at least while they survive sometimes they wouldnt be alive long the blood thirsty nations flood you with all the troops they can spare in large scoops all because you have the kingdom that is up roaring in applause or you made the mistake to rake one of the smaller nations for their creations that everyone hated and requested to be berated anyhow no such thing as peace in this huge game of chess that you are at cease with 1 piece on the board of the many stored that are civilizations that resulted in nothing but huge cremations if you make nice and not threaten anyone but before youre beaten theyll practically speak some random squeak and before anything can be prepared you see it pop up war has been declared but dont worry with technologies at hand aided by the religious doxologies from downloadable content that adds a congress that is not flawless the leaders gang in times where id prefer them to hold a revolver to my head with a loud bang unless youre rich and not stuck looking like a dip switch you have not many delegates from a few city states to aid you because you got in heated debates to embargo you or not with friends of course in the end it is fun just sometimes extremely laggy but seemly unnoticed when the turns take longer everyone gets stronger each person having a massive army which makes the enemy become quite barmy moving them all sometimes lasts until next fall but we never cared because we shared each others help while hearing the enemy yelp while the staffing got left to clean up the mess we were laughing and heading to the next target thatd inevitably have a bloody carpet otherwise can recommend

this game is remarkable get this instead of the garbage that is beyond earth for those unfamiliar with this series you pick a great civilization from history rome china aztecs england etc and start with a single city from there you will be playing for hours and hours as games take a very long time and its fun as hell exploring making allies and enemies with the other civilizations going to war making more cities managing resources to fuel your conquest and racing against the other players in an attempt to win the game winning the game can be complex as there are several ways to win you can win by destroying the other civs through war win scientifically by making it into space culturally with social policies or diplomatically with the united nations the game is very dynamic not a single playthrough is at all similiar with another leading to great fun that never tires the pros too many to list the game is beautifully structured and well thought out the cons buggy ai but not really an issue point is rather reading this wordy review you should be buying this game with all the expansion packs i cannot praise this game enough

civilization v would be a very good game if it were not for the shoddy multiplayer and the money grubbing dlc practice firstly the average multiplayer match freezes and crashes even if you have less than four players in your match you will still crash frequently multiplayer is not designed well on this game there are too many gamebreaking glitches to name of which can only be done in multiplayer games this is because the developers did not pay much attention to polishing this portion of the game since they seem to have been very busy releasing the 15  pieces of dlc which were made for this game this dlc has only divided the very tiny multiplayer community further because it can be hard to find a match of people who have the same dlc as you the singleplayer is where this game shines the developers obviously spent a huge amount of time polishing this portion of the game and this is what gives it replay value you can easily spend six hours on a single game of civilization v and still want to play more there are a few balance problems however these are relatively small overall civilization v is my favorite game despite some of the games shortcomings
recommended
 hours of addictive turnbased glee  fantastic new tactical combat system  excellent interface makes it easy to keep track of every aspect of the game  great automation features allow you to focus on the big picture  lovely visuals and classical soundtrack  ai too aggresssive  limited policies  might be too complex for some strategy fans

do you like stategy games do you like board games well then look no further friend welcome home civilizations 5th iteration is a great entry in this franchise and is addictive as it is fun prepare to loose many hours some may tell you this one is a weaker game than 4 or not worth playing without all the dlc i am not really in that group i had a lot of fun with the vanilla game the expansions add depth to mid and late game stages and provide more options for victory along with new civilizations each which has its own perks if you have even a mild itch for strategy games then press buy also note this game is very moddable  all supported by steam workshop which couldnt be easier to use

honestly civ could very well be one of the best strategy games ive played though im more a fan of the rts type stuff if im being completely honest picked this up randomly due to a friend talking about the previous one and although the early game is a bit dull and repetitive its well worth the time invested multiplayer is amazing giving you more than the stereotypical kill your enemy by purchasing units approach that c&c and stronghold went with however that rush attack is still a really viable strategy for the warmongers like myself ^^ as much as ive fallen in love with civ its diverse victory conditions and its generally good gameplay it falls a bit flat for me at points the graphics will sometimes bug out randomly though rarely enough to break the game also if youre playing offline against computers you may as well go solely for domination or a quick cultural victory as diplomacy is nonexistent ai will attack you after you give them trades return units and declare friendships which takes away from the overall experience  so play either hotseat mode with a couple friends or find a few players in the community online to play with if you want to get the most out of it prepare for a long game as civ can last quite some time the learning curve isnt so bad but its not a jump in and play game for sure  you really need to get the nuances down and read the tooltips that say what things can do fortunately the advisors arent half bad at keeping you posted all in all worth the purchase so go ahead pick this game up and see if your civilization can withstand the test of time pros awesome gameplay can win through multiple methods graphics are typically good barring some random sporadic glitches not a steep learning curve  you can get the basics in one or two games tops has a hotseat mode for a more oldschool multiplayer approach big deal if you have no internet or want to play with people who dont own the game tons of options to change the game as you please no barbarians victory types etc lot of modded content for those looking to spice the game up cons ai is frustrating other leaders will go from allied to at war in a matter of seconds for no real reason loading times can be long with multiple players graphics can bug out at times could use a little more variety across the board just my opinion montezuma go play a round against him and youll get that

sid meiers civilization v is a magnificent turnedbased strategy game you select a civilization start a city and build your empire in many ways unlike some strategy games civilization v can be won in more than one way these victories are cultural scientific diplomatic time and domination with the several different types of victory this in turn shapes how you play the game giving way to some unique strategies while the base game may not come with nearly as much content as it would with the two expansion packs its still sufficient enough to have lots of fun with it would be in your best interest to get one or both of the expansion packs for civilization v they add much new content ranging from civilizations to changing some aspects of gameplay ie traderoutes in brave new world i find myself playing for hours on end even if i play the game on quick theres no shortage of gameplay here and youll always be coming back for just that one extra turn the modding community it exists its great always an added bonus to any game modding support and a large modding community as you may have noticed in the tools section of the steam library civilization v comes with its own sdk source development kit to assist you in making mods and maps maps are very simple to make and modifying the games xml format files requires merely a text editor xml is a fairly simple data storing language and can be modified quite easily if you decide to get more into modifying the game and get lost there are many guides online to help you through your journey i whole heartedly recommend getting sid meiers civilization v for yourself especially when on sale its a bargain you cant beat there are some minor setbacks to the gameplay such as experiencing slightly elongated waiting periods after pressing the next turn button during the lategame period this may or may not be because of my older hardware going on 7 years and more often then not doesnt show up at all ive not been experiencing any elongated waiting periods as of approximately july 2014 i currently run the game on maximum settings at 1920 x 1080 resolution

quick summary of the game build a nation from the ancient era to the present day warning never play this game at night you will keep telling yourself this just one more turn and then ill go to bed well that turn could turn into 20 turns and before you know it 3 hrs have passed seriously this is a brilliant game for anyone who likes risk every playthrough is dynamic and awesome also there is a wide variety of civilizations to choose from though each civilization is simile they have different unique units that are a ton of fun to control in addition each civ leader speaks in their native language now thats some impressive research something that may be a problem is that even though now the ai in brave new world has been tuned down a bit they were too agressive in the earliar dlcs like gods & kings and probably wont provoke you into unnescessary war  it feels they are too passive as no bot provokes you anymore except when you deliberately do so when the main content gets boring the comunity has done some great mods that keep the experience ongoing such as maybe a new civilization or a new map design like middle earth from lord of the rings in conclusion i recomend this game highly for anyone who is a big fan of history

in sid meiers civilzation v you can play as one of the many historical nations of the world from both past and present from there you build expand make war make deals adopt policies and research lastly maintaining your economy and the overall happiness of your citizens you can also play as a mod civilzation some like sparta for example vlad the impaler the three kingdoms of ancient china and also play on player created maps ranging from the elder scrolls series to game of thrones and also with online you can play with your friends andor other players but be warn if you make any save during that match it is highly wise you know the people first last thing you want is an epic matching occuring and then suddenly the player no longer shows up after a day or two there are many things to do in this game from customizing your match playstyle both online and on singleplayer plus testing your skills in scenario modes another cool thing as well is the animations in the dipolmatic menu when dealing with other leaders although if you dont have a hig rig pc it is wise to turn that off completely and dont play for too long in my personal experience with this game it is always wise to have the autosave saving at least around 3 turns you make a slight problem with this game is the ai sometimes they make really odd choices like for example instead of surrending they fight it out till the end or if you take down half of their cities and embargo their civilzation from making trade instead of making peace and trying to find comproise they will still act like idiots and still wage war even on the lowest setting as i find out also be warn as well if you play this game on higher diffculty my advice take your time and plan everything out if you dont plan very well you will be crushed at this point it is wise to get all of the dlc since the majority of the mods rely on them other than that i recommend this game

sid meiers civilization v is the kind of game that almost anyone can get into even if you are a diehard fps player you will likely find some amusement in this game civilization v offers a vast variety of ways to play the game ranging from a campaignesque scenario mode to custom games where you pick and choose your opponents and possibly allies what kind of map you will be fighting for and what you will need to do to win do you want to conquer the world get a giant earth map add a dozen or two opponents and fight for world domination do you want to start your own religion and watch it spread across the globe like a true pandemic well start one send off your missionaries and start an inquisition you will be supreme pope of yourcultnamehere soon do you want to play out historical battles throughout the history well not much else to be said than you can some people might enjoy setting the difficulty setting all the way down and steamrolling their opponents others might do the opposite and try for the challenge of beating the game with a severe handicap playstyle plays a huge part in how you will enjoy civ5 but once you start a map it is as if it will never end the multiplayer aspect of the game has both upsides and downsides when playing with others you need to coordidnate who does what and it can trim parts of the game from your own experience as in you have to share certain wonders it is not beneficial to have multiple religions and it will suck fighting for superiority beyond that it can be great divvying up an opponents land between you and your friend for example get civilization v it is definitely one of my alltime favorites one more turn

just one more turn is civilizations unofficial motto anyone who played the game and enjoyed it will understand known as the biggest turnbased strategy game today with its rather unique hexagon tiled playfield civilization has entertained many throughout its lifespan  myself included i used to play a bunch load of civilization iii as a kid and civilization v has done a wonderful job of replacing that for the past 4 years back in the days turnbased strategy games were pretty common but today it feels like most games are realtime turnbased means you take turns to make your move rather than everyone making them at the same time like in every traditional board game evidently sid meiers civilization v is the fifth game in the series and it has really just gotten better and better by every game the core mechanics are always there but with some variation between each game the fanbase is rather scattered when it comes to agreeing on the best civilization game a lot of people still prefer civ iv personally i love civ iii a lot but civ v takes the prize the main problem with civilization v when it came was the lack of content compared to what civ iv already had today 4 years later tons of dlcs and 2 expansions have been released for the game and it finally has more content than its predecessor the game is about to create reign and fulfill a civilization throughout hundreds of years and overcome the obstacles alongside either online or vs computers explore expand exploit and exterminate  4x  is the best way to describe the typical steps when playing a game of civilization explore is for the first section of the game where you settle your first city and scout the surounding area for resources or opponents expand is when your small settlement becomes several either through settling another one or through conquest exploit is the description of diplomacy treaties spionage and rigging elections to make your cause the ultimate exterminate is pretty obvious if diplomacy or expantion does not work take the matter by the sword or the nuclear warhead there are 4 way of winning and becoming the master civilization cultural diplomatic scientific and by domination along those victory types are also paths for your civilization to easier obtain said victories for example you could focus your empire on trade and become a superpower through riches essentially buying votes for a diplomatic victory units for domination or technology for science you could also be the founder of a religion and slowly but steadily gain your trust from the people of other civilizations that way i was hoping to see a pure economical and religious victory condition but sadly there are none it feels like i have done pretty much everything in civilization v since its release but i still get really tempted to get back in there and just let the hours disappear suddenly you sit there 5 am in the morning and be like what the hell just happened i am not 12 anymore i have a fcking job i remember when i used to plan my next move during bathroom breaks i couldnt even think of something else for 5 minutes just one more turn i am really looking forward to civilization vi and civilization beyond earth i recommend civilization v for everyone not just strategy fans but everyone interested in having control and making decisions for an imaginary empire or if you just have a lot of time to spend i ensure you that you wont be disappointed
recommended
great game i reccomend having patience if you are going to buy this game a beautiful strategy game of whatif for example what if the great wall of china was made by america the great wall of america well thats possible watch yourself holding history in your hands and bending it to your will 1010 great game d

being a strategy game it is one of my all time favourite games of all time after the hours i have played i have become hooked and cant stop playing good things the gameplay is fun you have so many things you can go into but being the obvious science and domination are the main two things to go fourth to i like that if your computer can not handle the full graphics of the game or you just want to have a faster and better view so you can see the resources around you you can always switch to the strategic view pressing f10 bad things it is very time consuming yet addicting the amount of time it takes to complete a full game requires you to play with friends most of the time and not random people so you can always save and go back to it any time you want to

civilization v let me just start with this is an amazing game coming from a vetran of the older games i was at first scared to try the new stuff but once i got into civ v i never looked back btw civ iii is like a rage game try it at your own risk here are my pros and cons pros crisp clean modern graphics that still follows the look of a civilization game the leaders animations and looks are outstanding no unit stacking first i frowned at this but began to love it in previous civ games cirtain battles felt like my stack vs the other guys stack of units which felt sloppy in a since in retrospec combat takes strategy now not numbers advanced diplomacy and city states diplomacy in the origional civ v is meh but gods & kings and brave new world fix that easily city states makes the world feel more alive even if your on an island by yourself a city state there gives it life diplomatic victory is just as entertaining if not more than a domination victory the political struggles to hold delegates and get your proposals passed is a blast and cultural victory with the tourism bnw is very very thought provoking the add mod feature encourages its fanbase to be creative with making fun senarios pc master race ftw probably so much more pros that i cant think of atm so ill stop here  cons the only cons i can come to think of is happiness until you get an ideology or of the like your happiness seems a real challenge to keep up expecially in a war game but yet again i play on prince on lower difficulties this isnt a problem warmongering most ai seem very quick to neclect trading and deals with you if they suspect you of a warmongerer i go to war with france with the persians and take no cities and the arabians are denouncing me already if you resonably go to war for a cause they are responsible for you become the joseph stallin of the world my only complaint would be to tone this down a little other than that this game is a blast like the addict i am ive played over 1k hours of this game so i hope this helps 1010 would restart account and get achevements again

probably the best strategy game to approach with a group of friends with the intention of partaking in a saga of epic battles and journeys to conquest and probably the best strategy game that amounts to simply flubbing around with your friends in merely a matter of minutes games are rather slow even on the fast game settings stay away from epic if you value your lifespan and playing with that one guy that always takes at least 5 minutes to finish his turn can be very much agonising think five player chess wait times the payoff however more than makes up for it the feeling of carrying your army across the continent to royally screw over your friend who you were suppossedly allied with is like none other as is launching a nuke at every neighbouring country and bribing chengis khan to mount an attack at the vatican rounds may take a few hours but youll be talking about them for the next week fans of the previous civ games may however be a little disappointed with this edition as it seems a few majorly awesome mechanics have been removed along with with a whole bunch of not so awesome mechanics even religions are nowhere to be found within vanilla but thankfully both brave new world and gods and kings restore all that was missing to make civ v as great as its predecessors between some fantastic dlc and steam workshop functionality you can play as cthulu in the world of tamriel and found pastafastarianism civ may not be a perfect game to please all but its certainly as close as it gets in terms of civilisation

overhelming holy master of strategy [kamgustas review] i always tried to play civilization but the outdated graphics and the 2d squared tiles never managed to catch my interest with civilization v they finally introduced hexagonal tiles and a rich 3d world so i grabbed the gods & kings expansion and gave it a try at first the game is overhelming with informations and details but it will take you hand by hand and introduce all the mechanics step by step after 30 hours and 493 turns i finished my first play and i was able to manage almost everything this game is simply gargantuous there are tons of things to do and manage there are dozens of leaders each one with its strenghts and weaknesses there are 5 different ways of winning a game and you can customize the map in even the smallest detail there are also premade scenaries steamworks support and a very populated multiplayer simply wow just three advices 1 do not read the tips and tricks or they will ruin your fun showing the best strategies there arent so much so knowing these may lower your fun of trying new ways to beat the other civilizations 2 buy the expansions these are not moneysucker dlcs but they really improve the base game 3 always keep an eye on the clock i started playing it at 2300 and i left the game at 600 with conquered cities allies powerful armies and frozen legs it sucked 7 hours of my life without me realizing best played with keyboard and mouse recommended buy price < 50$ score 910

sid meiers civilization v really changed my opinion about strategy simulation games this game is very diverse and no two games are alike you start out as a civilization with one city and you slowly build your way up to be the dominator the diplomatic leader or the first to finish the space race not only all this but it is historically accurate

just look at the amount of time reviewers have spent playing this game yeah its that good as other reviewers have mentioned the game is newbfriendly i was brand new to the civ franchise but thanks to the advisor system in the game i was able to pick up the basics very quickly after youve started feeling comfortable or if you are not a newb in the first place those advisors can easily be turned off in the options this is a fantastic strategy game that will keeping you thinking for hours even when youre not playing the gameplay is rich deep and complex ive spent over 400 hours with this game and i still notice new things and consider different strategies i started playing games on warlord difficulty level 3 of 8 and ive advanced enough that i feel pretty confident on emperor now 6 of 8 i recommend watching some deitylevel lets plays to help develop your understanding of the game and to consider some new strategies civ 5 is also stunningly beautiful however you can play it on older systems when i got the game i was running a 2006 dell dimension e521 with an amd athlon 64 3800 and an nvidia gt9500 which i put in specifically so i could do some gaming and it ran just fine on low to medium settings it just got more beautiful when i built my new rig with a 4th gen intel i7 and gtx760 and could run it on max settings the music is also spectacular im still listening to it not muting it like some other games i play during gameplay even after 400 hours i have all the dlc and i would highly recommend you go ahead and get the complete edition bare minimum though get the brave new world expansion it adds so much richness to the base game enjoy building a civilization that will stand the test of time

sid meiers civilization v is the best strategy game ive played the new hex grid tile system works extremely well for combat allowing for a much more strategic intellectual battle sadly the game doesnt fully feel complete without both the gods & kings and brave new world dlc packs g&ks revamps the technology tree adds more buildings units and civilizations includes an espionage system and adds a religion system to the game bnw adds a new cultural systemvictory new civilizations ideologies trade routes and a world congress both dlc packs are a musthave for the full complete experience be prepared to be a victim of just one more turn

this game is great for ruining reltionships dropped a nuke on my buddy he wouldnt face me for the rest of the week 1010 would nuke again

the depth and replayability are unsurpassed it took a couple of expansions to catch up to the enjoyment i felt playing its predecessors but now with all of the new systems in place it has become one of my favorite iterations in the series thank you sid meiers brian reynolds jeff briggs microprose hasbro infogrames atari interactive taketwo 2k games firaxis and any others i am forgetting for providing me with years of such boundless entertainment i can only imagine what the future holds for such an amazing and storied franchise

for those who are not familiar with the civ games sid meiers civiliazation is a simulation of how and why the political statusquo is as it is today in randomly generated map though its not your only option play the leader of a slightly to heavily flavoured nation and quest for world dominition either kill everyone make them love you make a utopia or be the first to send the rocket to space sometimes youll be the baddy sometimes youll the curse the vandal leader who will play purely combat while you build your latest wonder this games realism is really informative and there are many things to learn from this simulation its replayability is one of its strongest points since youll definitely want to try again for a better setting resources and other civ placement different map size different nation etc for those familiar with previous installments is there anything better than a resuscitation of a game you already love with new graphics newdifferent nations and a slightly different approach to some of the mechanics i cant say this is wholly an improvement or a deterioration in terms of realism since although the diplomacy is much better and a diplomatic victory is actually an option now the religion mechanic for example is more of game nature than the more realistic civ 4 counterpart this is less blocky and repetitive than civ4 and much easier to play though you may not like all the changes no more stack of doom p

i have been playing civilization since it first came out  even back when the games units had white backgrounds to distinguish them from the maps assests it still held that special something that made it one of the greatest and deepest strategies of all time civilization 5 is the perfected version of civilization especially with the sales that steam has for the complete version you would be crazy to not pick this up regardless of your flavor of genre this game like all of its predecessors will have you up at 3am saying just one more turn

your average civ game gandhi has completed the manhattan project quit game without saving exit civ 5 exit steam delete civ 5 delete steam shut down computer punch the screen in break the computer with a hammer throw the computer out of the window burn the computer with a flamethrower dance on the ashes naked buy a plane ticket to india go to a missile silo launch a nuke leave india watch and laugh as the rest of the world pulverizes gandhis smug face with nukes kill yourself alexander has won a diplomatic victory come back to life repeat 88 gr8 game m8 gandhi with the pro b8s 420 nukes

this let me live out my lifelong fantasy of being a warmongering dictator i was able to govern an empire with an iron fist and crush all of my enemies with a horrible wrath 1010 would conquer and rule all with fury again
recommended
this game allows you to unleash the inner sadistic dictator that we all are underneath burning cities and ravaging the countryside engaging in a preemptive strike against gandhi i was able to keep him in the renaissance era while everyone else moved on into the modern era preventing him from nuking me or anyone else in the future in the meantime i took part in the very practice i claimed to condemn and sent two consecutive atomic bombs to amsterdam this game allowed me to engage in a foreign policy similar to the usas without the real life worldwide scorn and condemnation 1110 the only thing i would add to the game is the ability to stage false flag terror attacks to further the realism
recommended
in civilization alas is assumed that the neighboring power much hate my country and then also much begging me not to destroy their city but im not offended no its fun in my opinion this is the best turn based strategy ive ever met i recommend
recommended
pros i can play this game casually and competitively all the civs mean you can have alot of replayability i personally find this fun and can play it in long sessions mods are fun simple learning curve cons if you plan to play multiplayer games then you have to buy dlcs which is expensive bugs are rare but they can be game breaking and barely fixed overall a great game 910
recommended
the best game around the universe that can stand the test of time 1110 would waitjustonemoreturn i rule by world domination

sid meiers civilization v vainilla sucks hard but with both expansions its a pretty good game i suggest you to buy the whole thing or not buying it at all since without the expansions there will be no religion no espionage and the diplomacy will be pretty broken too making the game kind of unplayable three weak spots 1you can not found companies like in civilization iv beyond the sword 2edit warmongering is super tricky and difficult now 3the empire happiness system was improved a lot but its still illogical since every city should have his own level of happiness like in civilization iii or civilization iv you could have an empire happiness level system but it should be regulated from the individual level of happiness of every city lets say you have an empire with 2 cities lisboa and oporto if oporto is under siege its logical that the happiness of oporto drops and than that deteriorates its growth commerce and productivity but why should lisboa which is very far away from the warfront be upset about it lets be real every city has its own problems should there be factors that deteriorate the happiness of all cities yes like nuclear war declaring war against civilizations with the same idiology or religion but happiness should not be only global the fact that you build a circus in oporto does not make lisboa any better it makes no sense if lisboa is overpopulated let lisboa be upset and unhappy about it but its madness that because one overpopulated city the whole productivity of your empire drops said that this game is good stuff good graphics good combat system even better that civilization iv decent diplomacy no bugs at all very nice multiplayer all civilizations are good but england and france

i really like that part of oldest sitcom in history of game development  so guys just try and enjoy that stuff if u will play with friends u will find great timekiller and funny moments in that game  civilization v back us to classic hexagons rather than civ iv its first good sign 2 great multiplayer mode 3 great scenarios for lone wolves 4 extended settings for your own game 5 recommended by time  6 of course i love that soundtrack great work by composers 7 i think that game have balance all nations have own bonuses choice what u like and beat your opponents 8 for newbies  easy to learn omg its just civilization what i can say more and only one bad sign i can say about civ v  cropped release version because if you want religion  you will need to buy dlc gods & kings nobody like that marketing politic cheers mazy

really addicting gameworth the money
recommended
i am a fan of turn based strategy games i know a lot of people find these to be the antithesis of fun but for me i find the slower pace to be quite enjoyable it is just a blast to watch your civilization grow and finally envelope the world the game can be challenging but it is just so fun to watch your guys who have developed to the freaking space age tearing through the medieval armies of your foes it is one of those games that is difficult to stop playing i have played games from start to finish in one sitting those familiar with the title can tell you that can be a long while cannot recommend this game enough
recommended
solid game like civilization series before but you need complete edition to explore more potential of this game

one of the best games i have ever played especially if you get the dlcs

just in case playtime recorded doesnt count as a recommendation on its own i ing recommend this game seriously do you like strategy games okay buy this we dont have anything else to talk about the expansions are well worth it too though if youre only going to pick up one id say grab brave new world if you can even get the second before the first i wouldnt know the trading system gives you a lot more to think about but its really the update to cultural victories with tourism museums and artifacts that make the expansion for me if you like nonaggressive play the changes are amazing there isnt quite as much to offer for you warmongers but moving resources around with the trade routes is still going to be important not to mention it added venice which is pretty much the only civ you will ever need to play as ever again the religion and espionage systems added in gods and kings are definitely fun but i felt both systems couldve been a little deeper i really wanted to set myself up as a sort of 16th century vatican city puppetmastertype civ but alas both systems are integrated in the changes to brave new world though and i found that worth it as well get them both dont even wait for a sale buy them all right this instant
recommended
freaking amazing best topview strategy game i ever played i love how you can control who is in the world and the difficulty level map type etc i felt like i was competing against real players when i was faced with the ai leaders in the game i actually checked to see if i was in multiplayer somehow by accident 1010

with the expansions civilization v is one of the best strategy games ever made i cant recommend it highly enough
recommended
you can play this game for 12 hours and still not finish
recommended
this game is brilliant my pc isnt the best so i decided id give the demo a go it gives just enough to make you really want to see more i picked up the gold version of the game and had a lot of fun with that but i would really advise getting the brave new wolrd expansion too it adds great new systems to the game there isnt really anything else i can say that a go at the demo wouldnt say other than if you get this game get brave new world too
recommended
civilization v is a very fun strategy game you choose a country which you are the great leader of such as george washington for usa and elizabeth for england you try to build a strong civilization you can win five different ways using diplomacy using millitary using science using culture or just having your civilization have the highest score by 2050

one of the best strategy games ive ever played so many hours have gone into this game its ridiculous highly recommend getting the expansion pack because it completes the game where the original falls short if youre a fan of turn based games this is a must

with only a thousand pounds in my pocket i was just able to afford sid meierss civilization v and the gold edition and the dlc and the limited edition sid meierss keychain at first i was fairly sure that i had accidentally bought farming simulator 2014 but then i realised that they have not released that game yet the defining moment of this game was when i made an artillery cannon and blew up most of spain i dont have anything against people from spain i just think that their country is really hot and once i went there and asked for a glass of milk and was given a shot of vodka i was going to complain but the man behind the counter was really scary so i didnt my favourite sid meierss civilization v to play as is russia because it means i dont have to look at the russian lady who is not very pretty i think they could have stepped up their game and bit their lip and hired someone better because she is negatively portraying russians as ladys who dont have legs but instead have strange domes which need massive dresses to hide my verdict overall is ok but i think if sid meiers took care of his civilization he wouldnt have to keep replacing them

this is definitley one of the best strategy games ive ever played and the fact that its modable just makes it so much better i might be new to civ but if you love strategy get this game its worth every cent although if you want cuz its pretty expensive with the expansion packs then wait until there is a sale then you can buy the gold edition having an expansion pack adds so much to the gameplay either wait or buy now but once you do buy it well enjoy
recommended
civilization v is an immensely popular steam game and rightly so its just one more turn brilliance is down to lots of brilliant options to customise your game and an abudance of great mods to add for further customization no playthrough is ever the same i would recommend this game to anyone interested in history geography or just strategy games in general its realism is sufficient yet not so much as to be boring firstrate game in my opinion i would recommend that you buy the goldcomplete edition if you are serious about playing the game it gives you the nice dlcs that are really worth their money
recommended
really fun and really addicting once you really get into it
recommended
this  game  is  epic its complex at first but really fun
recommended
amazing game not only does civ v rise up to the expectations of series it exceeeds themwhile the army stacking may be a small flaw other features including simplified diplomacy and improved interface make the issue almost nonexistant if you played a perivous issue of the series or are a fan of strategy in any sort pick up a copy of this game asap
recommended
buy this and the brave new world expansion 710 civ v 910 civ v brave new world
recommended
this is an awesome game
recommended
buy it just do it tis worth every penny from the hours of gameplay you gain from it
recommended
i thoroughly recommend sid meiers civilization v as it provides literally hundreds of hours of captivating entertainment at the expense of a mere 40 earth dollars you can have endless fun attacking your not really best friends with nuclear weapons of mass destruction destroying all of their tiresome efforts in one fell swoop i dont recommend doing that last part too much as judging from personal experience it can tend to provoke suicidal thoughts in the victims mind other than that its pretty  and overpriced
recommended
the words just one more turn have a different meaning in civ v  one day i wanted to do a fast and short matchit took 9 hours 1010
recommended
great strategy although some glitches if you are running an extremely long game my friends and i hotseat alot on his computer and i finally bought it for solo play great game
recommended
do you like playing games for >10 hours on end without stopping because you just have to build that last road or take down that one city or finally stop gandhi from his scheming tricks then buy this game 1010 best turnbased strategy all time
recommended
this is quite possibly the worlds best and most addictive game and i highly recomend that you buy this game right now
recommended
its just so hexy i love it
recommended
you will lose countless hours in taking another turn
recommended
just buy it its very good game cant stop playing
recommended
ive whiled away many an hour playing every version of this game civ v has its detractors among those who want a highly detailed wargame along the lines of civ iv but i like its focus on immersion and versatility its still not the perfect version of the game it wants to be but brave new world is a giant leap toward that ideal the layers of possibilities for your civilization have never been so diverse and interesting all hail the king of turnbased strategy
recommended
just one more turn before bed just one more man just one turn 6 hours later still playing civ 910

ghandi may look goodbut it will be bad when the manhatten project starts

i can be gaben lord of the pc master race i love the workshop other than that good game especially with the dlcs
recommended
i made a giant death robot and then an unoriginal comment 1010
recommended
since its release civilization 5 has gone through a long period of developement to reach the point where it is today if this were a review of the original game before the brave new world expansion then no there is no way i could honestly reccomend this game it was by no means a bad game beforehand it was just that it felt somewhat incomplete and it couldnt stand alongside sid meiers previous releases however looking at the game after brave new world was released and after it has been extensively updated sid meiers civilization 5 has truly become a game which just like its predecessors can stand the test of time as a somewhat more casual gamer due to my time constraints i really shouldnt like the civilization series but somehow i do manage to find the time to slot a few games in here and there but yeah i dont know what else to say about the game except that its ing amazing but you should get brave new world otherwise it kind of feels a bit incomplete
recommended
amazing a blast with friends conquering and crusading for your glorious nation and renaming every city something silly is one of the best things to happen to gaming 1010 would play again

i played it and gahndi nuked me

note i played a lot more of this during the elongated time my internet was down sid meiers civ v is an awesome turn based stratergy game rich in content and only deepened by the vast collection of online mods gameplay is simple at first but surprisingly deep and addictive you pick a leader and you rule your country you start with only a few units and anciet technology but soon amass yourself with large armies and highly advanced mordern technology forging alliances with leaders is fun but the ai is rather idiotic at times and that can be troublesome but its only a small problem for such a well made game just one more turn

recommended
this game has consumed 400 hours of my life no regrets
recommended
very good strategy game easy to learn hard to master
recommended
its not like this game is so obscure that it actually needs a recommendation but i thought i would add one from the perspective of someone who has never played a civ game until 5 i grew up on pc games and could have easily played any of the previous versions but for some reason just felt this wasnt really my type of thing well it took 20 years or so but i can finally admit i was wrong its a really fun and extremely addicting game that said there is definitely a bit of a learning curve for newbies i really had no idea what i was doing at first but eventually it all gels and you start to see why the series has been so popular i have no idea how civ 5 compares to previous games but from personal experience i can at least confirm that its most definitely a good place to start for those new to the series if you are like me and was never really sure if civ was for you i say give this a try youll probably be addicted before you know it just one more turn

civilization v is a must buy for any turnbased strategy gamers out there it allows you to grow a civilization of your choice through the ancient era all the way up to the information era if you can survive until then that is the vanilla game itself is decent but is lacking in some areas i highly recommend buying the complete edition which includes two major dlcs gods and kings and brave new world with some other small civilization and map dlcs

civ5 is kind of like a sandwich with all the ingredients its the best one youve had take out the mayo and cheese and its still tasty but you feel no satisfaction

well then the time has finally come to review what has occupied my life for the past months oh civ 5 how i underestimated you this past summmer when i saw your goty edition on steam how i was hesitant to buy you and thought your gameplay was boring if only i knew i bought this game out of pure review score which of course being a 90 i assumed was something special as many of the steam games that are bought during sales do it sat on my library quite some time while i was busy murdering teemos on the fields of justice when i finally got tired of that i decided to check this game out so i double clicked on the icon and went into the game with little to no prior knowledge of what lay in store ahead i booted up the tutorial grabbed my water and said well civ 5 do your worst i was greeted by a morgan freeman like voice telling me about america and its past along with some facts about george washington this narrator got me so pumped up the combination of music the epic dialouge the voice mother of god the voice i had so many goosebumps running over my body that i could hardly contain myself and then i did it i pressed begin your journey little did i know this would take me above and beyond what i believed was a true gaming experience it started out simple a settler and a warrior unit and some lady telling me to found a city i plop it down and start producing a monument moving my warrior around and reasearching pottery i found my neighbor soon after the incas and i was greeted by a stunning display screen with a great voice actor and interface soon enough i had made a declaration of friendship and one thing led to another and all i remember was me saying justonemoreturn i ended up playing the tutorial for 6 hours straight yes 6 hours on the tutorial and it was glorious i ended up panicking and  at the fact that i could not save my progress but i digress it was the tutorial after all nowadays i find myself using my spare hours to play this meth like game my grades were rekt my relationships were rekt my reading life was rekt my league career was rekt and my plans to play bioshock infinite were rekt all in all i give this game a 2010 and reccomend you pick it up now that it will be dirt cheap with the summer sale only and only if you would like to have some ghandi nuking you would you like to make a trade agreement with england cursing that damned jungle king monty and oh my god that wounder was one freaking turn away from being built i just wasted 25 days of production and only got a measly 100 gold saniadsufludsbasfjdsbfjsfdslfa filled afternoons then this is the game for you life status rekt   not rekt   tyrannosaurus rekt

i have almost all the civ games and they are all similar but have their own feel civ iv is my personal favorite but civ v is a close second
recommended
i love playing civ v graphics are great though there are some loading issues and sometimes slow game progression the new additions from civ iv are really good and adding some mods helps bring back some of the removed content

just one more turn civ 5 plus both expansions is the best civilization to date in my opinion great user interface best tactical combat of the series fantastic looking graphics wise and most importantly very fun and addicting all eras now seem wonderfully fleshed out thanks to the expansions and the game now feels as complete as civ 4 did wth beyond the sword
recommended
very fun game to play if you are into a turnbased strategy game that can take up to hours to complete then civilization v is the game for you you can choose different paths to win the game if its increasing your culture or researching new technologys you will always be watching your back for other civilizations who might attack you out of jealousy or hate very addictive game that can keep you entertained for hours a must buy strategy game

an all around fantastic 4x rts game civilization v once it has the two major expansions gods & kings and brave new world is an amazingly engulfing game so much of it is designed to pull you in and keep you wishing to advance your empire one more turn winning the game can be completed multiple ways with large or small empires and on higher difficulties victory can be a mad dash to the finish combat is fun and offers enjoyment in outwitting your opponent or holding off large waves of enemies at a choke point the units are are crafted in high detail and each civilization plays a slightly different way letting you try a vast array of different strategies the game is not without its faults however the biggest of these issues is the ai which can be confusing or downright moronic additionally while the shift to tacticalstyled combat is a nice change of pace in the series the ai doesnt seem to grasp how to make the most of its units and can make obvious tactical blunders with startling regularity the games netcode and stability are also questionable at times once larger maps come into play but when it is working play is smooth and almost seamless from one turn to the next all in all an excellent game in a series full of wellmade games

probably the best game ive ever played very addictive fun with mates

sid meiers civilization v is really one of the best strategy games of the genre and the best of its series clocking in countless hours i still find myself frequently playing the game and still discovering new content and strategies that only add more depth to the game graphics  detailed enviroments and units  beautiful terrain and water gameplay  dozens of civilizations to play as with unique units and traits  hours of features that bring you back to play  not to diffucult of a learningcurve  easy to set up multiplay that allows you to play easily with friends  buggy multiplayer overall this is one of the best games i have in my library and one of the best i have ever played i also recommend others in the series as they add their own unique spin on the genre and provide even more unique gameplay 910

a very complex game that has a slight curving point for noobs though it takes a while to master it it is still by all means my favorite game the things i like about it it has very fun scenarios such as the american civil war scramble for africa and the fall of rome to name a few there are a lot of countries to choose and master it takes true strategy you cant just build a city and say youll win you probably wont with that overconfidence a very good wide variety of maps too choose from the multiplayer is amazing except for the fact that if you go to war with another human player you have to play in sequential order the graphics are quite astonishing aswell the things i dislike about it there are no multiplayer scenarios  overall i give this game a 9510 please leave any critizism in the comments thanks d

50 hours into your latest save all is going well only 3 leaders left gandhi caesar and washington you draft an end game plan in your mind you will make friends with gandhi for obvious reasons hes chill then procede to befriend caesar then you will take out washington because he is a  and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior he must pay 20 turns later all is going to plan we are now on washingtons doorstep gandhi and caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation all we need to do is eliminate the pesky americans and ith all our military now on american soil this should not take long then after the swift invasion of america we will make a vote for world peace at the un in rome of course with our new found indian and roman brethren it is a sure win but all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start quickly they become louder and louder what is this you think to yourself a false alarm you shrug it off maybe caesae bombing a city state the game pauses gandhi appears on the screen with a sinister grin he shouts war in your face only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight the camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy the capital of your glorious nation you then hear a rumble just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine you realise it is too late you can only watch as the missle closes in as your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people then silence before what had just occurred had sunk in before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears suddenly countless stealth bombers appear seemingly out of no where soon the sky is blackened by planes the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains you faint from the shock of what is unfolding you awake shortly after gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire now with giant death robots making the most of his seemingly never ending turn as gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes whats left of your broken nation all you can do is weep your people hacked down in their prime and your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn why oh why did you turn of autosave did it really speed your game up was it worth it ghandi is a complete  he acts like your friend but will nuke the  out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself 1010

i am the peaceful nation of the celts we shall be the nation of religion and of diplomacy this went well we ended up next to the babylonians and we expanded nicely in peace however i have always believed in dibs so i placed down glasgow onto the land between us to provide a little buffer they seemed annoyed by this a few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years but otherwise nothing too bad happened in order to spread our religion further because we were known for our confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster we begin to invest in boats soon we covered the oceans in missionaries inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies babylon was making friends with a local city state genoa however they were trying to spread zoroastrianism those heathens despite both our religions being known for their peace we passiveaggressively sent missionary and inquisitor to genoa over the course of about 700 years we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions those same warriors had been given spears now but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders i offer babylon some sugar for their spice they wanted my sugar iron coal and all of my money i then asked germany if they wanted sugar for spice they accepted north of me rome had begun a war with france due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade i found myself with a huge amount of money everytime france and rome made peace i knew that rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes so i bought i gifted many city states my religion and gold and then i bought gifted france and germany enough money to declare with with rome while they fought my spearmen now musketmen continued to glare with babylons and we continued our 1500 year religious passiveaggression over genoa they said i was spying on them i said i wouldnt when my spies returned i sent them back to babylon a squad of 5 great prophets charged into babylon converting left right and centre babylon complained i was being a bit aggressive i apologised i then sent more missionaries to babylon i had now found every single civilization we decided to have a united nations meeting in 1600ad i as the host gave everyone a single vote except myself i gave myself 16 due to my popularity i declared my religion to be the world religion every one opposed i listened to their opinions and then passed it anyway when rome got angry about this i then paid france to declare war again when babylon got angry i then paid rome to declare war on them my civilians were amazingly happy hugely more than any other place but because i was an emperor they declared me declis the terrible despite my universal healthcare happy citizens peaceful religion not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word my army consisted of mostly my friends my city states and my musketmen now great war infantry continued to glare at the babylonian great war infantry after 2000 years a great duty to my nation their descendants shall continue to frown at the babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall eventually we reached a grand united nations meeting i sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 city state friends and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side i said that the peoples confucian republican empire of scotland was the best nation in the world they all voted against me i smiled and then declared i won anyway democracy is overrated freedom of religion only applies to my religion i dont need to be stronger when im more popular and my people are probably more beautiful and if you dont like me ill pay your best friend to backstab you through this i came to understand american foreign policy so civilization is if nothing else an educational tool

a very relaxing game to play once those achievements start racking up it becomes very addictive the multiplayer takes the game to a whole new level as well either playing against friends or on the same team

amazing strategy game it is the child of aoe ii and starcraft even though it is turnbased i would highly reccommend playing with a group of friends as playing ai can get monotonous however it is still very enjoyable dont feel bad if you lose on higher difficulties though it will happen often before you find your favorite civ and playstyle
recommended
a great game you control a country of your choice with a historical ruler and it puts you in a randomly generated map where you develop your civilization construct buildings research technologies recruit units and interact with other nations while trying to achieve either a military cultural or science victory i would definetly reccomend to those who are fans of strategy games

civilization v is the first game i played in the civilization series recommended by my friends the game slowly robs you of your time absorbing you into its gameplay until five hours have gone by and youve gone from trying to not be overrun by barbarians to blasting foreign cities with cannons while building the lourve brave new world made the midgame a lot more interesting and balanced and its fun finding which nations suit your play style burying your problems in gold researching faster than everyone else converting everyone to your religion etc in my first playthrough i was a militaristic japanese nation who nuked washington dc for some meta humor 1010
recommended
just all around fun game to play when you are in the mood to be nuked by ghandi 1010
recommended
sid meiers civilization v is a game that will keep you intrigued and entertained for hours on end be warned however that this game eats time the tutorial itself is eight hours long with both the base game and dlc the game never feels repetitive and is always entertaining

i really really really like this game my friends forced me to play starcraft ii it was good but i thought it should go slower and this is more relaxing so its perfekt

mustbuy strategy game this game when it has all the dlcs is way too addicting and is a blast to play through your own alternate history its way too easy to spent 8 hours simply building up your own empire and then several more in a devestating war for more land only buy this game if it is with all the dlcs particularly brave new world because the dlcs add some great features that the base game missed just buy the complete edition really right now

be prepared to have a 12 hour gaming session set the game down for 46 months and then pick it up again for another halfday session this game is a good way to sink a ton of time but gets repetitive fairly fast

gandhi built a city just to try to steal silk away from me i dont like when someone tries to steal my silk 1110 would nuke him again

one of the better games that i have played after you get started in a game the just one more turn mentality is insanely addicting i highly recomend this game even if you are new the turn based strategy genre
recommended
awesome game cant wait for civ beyond earth
recommended
really good game
recommended
civilization vs appeal comes from its rather humorous and endlessly entertaining historical scenarios and simpletograsp mechanics that allow any casual strategy game enthusiast to sink their teeth into ive sunk hours upon hours into this game because of it and i keep coming back for just one more turn of this long but incredibly enticing game give it a shot no matter what game genre you like its for everyone

civ 5 is a game which there is much fun to be had you can easily get 70 hours with this game 1010 must buy
recommended
civ 810 this game takes so much time off your day and it is still so much fun even though you just sit there and use one hand just like watching adult filmsone game takes hours and that is when your settings are on quick mode well i am not really sure i am a casual gamer not really competitive fun with friends it is always so much fun building your own empire whether you overpower your enemy or just simply build a utopia for your people and win through peace the game is awesome ps just press next turn already
recommended
normally id start this review off by saying something like if youre into strategy games this is a must buy but ironically i myself am not a big fan of strategy games so i think it speaks volumes to the entertainment value of this game when i have logged over 600 hours into civ v yet dont identify myself as a lover of the turn based strategy genre if you can grab this for a good price its absolutely a must buy
recommended
very addicting game really intense and i reccomend people buying this game
recommended
made hentai a religion 5 stars
recommended
oh ill just finish this turn 5 hours later youre still thinking the same thing

ghandi pointed a nuke at me and told me to rate this game good 1010 would nuke again
recommended
truly a great game relatively slow paced at times but so full of content especially with the expansions brave new world  gods and kings
recommended
i had to uninstall this game to keep miself from playing it
recommended
to me this game is fun i can go for hours on end sometimes playin this game not the best at it but there are so many options and goals there are like 5 ways you can win for s sake you can spread religion gain culture science and a bunch of other  its ing awesome especially with the workshop it has huuuuge potential only beat 1 game in 20 hours but its definitly a great time consumer were u to play on your plane flight i will never do online as that  would take days but still good game if you like long matches with tons of options probably the most changable game with workshop on steam
recommended
fun game multiplayer works fine 1010
recommended
472 hours in and the game is still as dynamic and engaging as ever
recommended
every game is different thats why i enjoy this game so much
recommended
i enjoy playing this game however i wouldnt rate myself as a serious player for it i like that you can attack other players however i prefer much smaller games as opposed to large games as unfortunately i get bored after a while im much more of a skyrim girl good game though and my husband loves it he can play it for hours
recommended
ignore all the griping you hear about civ 5 being dumbed down or too different from civ 4 its still a great strategy game and with the gods and kings expansion just around the corner its going to get even better
recommended
genghis we could have ruled the world

great for a bigger lan with your friends there is no stopping mid game you play it all in one session got it you think you can just stop the game and socialize with people no the game eats you whole without a warning
recommended
this game has eaten too much of my time you can start a game at 5pm play for what seems like an hour then check the time and have it at 2am highly addictive and amazingly well put together this is a must for all game strategists library
recommended
when played with all the expansions and dlcs quite simply the best pc game ever at least in my opinion
recommended
hart vidogam make it fun at time i many lik it

ive been saying to myself this is the last turn i swear but im just not able to quit these are the problems that show up as soon as you begin understanding the fundementals of this game sid meiers civlization v is a turnbased 4x game where you manage you cities and make sure your people are well fed and happy the goal in this game is to be the most progressive population on the planet you start out with a city that fits the population youve chosen from here on out you start exploring and building things with the first unit you will find things like ruins and barbarian camps the barbarians are your first real enemy you will have to try to fight them off while progressing your first city when you start expanding alot you find out that the barbarians are not a real threat anymore in fact you will be alot more busy with the other populations on the map the other populations can be friendly but also an enemy this is where diplomacy comes in some leaders of the populations may trick you and create traps to backstab you after a while so you have to be carefull on what you decide whats best you also get to trade and discuss with these leaders for instance you could trade a luxury that your population wishes for after a couple of hundered turns youll get the hang of it and start liking the game alot for me its the progressing that makes me hooked to this game its the mentality of just finishing this one thing that makes it soo addicting to me i find it to be one of the best games i have every played this is the first civilization game i ever played but now i regret that i never played the previous parts of this series all in all a great game i highly recommend it
recommended
if i had to choose between this or satisfying my heroin addiction i would choose this

i love this game its very realistic allows you to change history with each action in each time period or stick to the books on what really happened in the past the various ways to win the game gives a lot of choice in how you want to become the greatest civilization in history there are a ton of mods that add many new ways to play aqnd win also you can invite friends and have massive battles or simply be peaceful with more then 10 players overall this game is amazing and is 5 out of 5

recommended
in four words  best of a kind totally recommend it
recommended
i think it is the best iteration of the civilization franchise yet letting no more than one combat unit occupy a space expands the tactcal strategy of the game a must by and excellent expansions
recommended
hello this is very good game pls jones and ellstrm buy this game it is very good and also tres bien as the french often say gg wp

great game nor as much depth as civilization 4 but combat has improved tenfold with brave new world the game is great and almost matches up to its predecessor almost

recommended
this is a really fun game that you just have to own i love all the dlc and its an amazing game dont question it just buy it
recommended
this game is awesome and diverse its very lengthy to complete a session

without any of the addon packages civ v is still a decent game but somewhat of a sidegrade from civ iv add gods and kings and brave new world however and you have yourself a heck of a game thats very rich in content very deep in gameplay and very very addictive my complaints are few namely i wish the barbarian levels were adjustable theyll wreck your civ in multiplayer and i wish multiplayer were a bit less buggy however these are minor compared to all the amazing gameplay
recommended
this game is very fun it is stratigy based and provides loads of game play d
recommended
best strategy game ever created
recommended
i really really really like this game my friends forced me to play starcraft ii it was good but i thought it should go slower and this is more relaxing so its perfekt
recommended
dont play this game before you go to bed
recommended
i played quite a bit in lan so far in coop mod against ais its alot of fun and quite addictive and well you tell yourself after lunch ok lets play half an hour then you look outside after 15 minutes and its getting dark well you get the picture i guess i  we are gonna train a little more vs the ai taking over the entire map and then do the same in online mp yeeeeaaaa right p on a slight downside though your view constantly jumps around to units needing orders or your allies battles this can get very frustrating after a while since you can not do anything while the battle is going on either there are ways to stop this from happening but often this causes the nice battle animations to not show at all i have not looked at anything from the modders community perhaps they got a solution anyhow the game is an overall very awsome experience
recommended
a great game and easy to get in to just dont start on deity if you are new to the civ series 1010
recommended
best global strategy youll never find anything better in this genre
recommended
great game good graphics i would recommend this game
recommended
civilization 5 is addicting and fun
recommended
great game
recommended
as a new time gamer i really enjoy this game there is definitely a lot of strategy required in making sure your civilization is victorious i cant wait to delve deeper into the game and experience more of the strategy
recommended
one of the best time wasters i have ever played can easily zap away the day one of the main reason i try not to play it too much as i have too many games to catch up on endless space is almost like this game just in space and a steeper learning curve that sucks up alot of time if you love strategy games andor turn based games i highly reccomend this game to you watch these hilarious civilization commericials httpwwwyoutubecomwatchv_ojpzokafu then my favorite for the fourth game httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvkrnsv69_tmg
recommended
awesome game but a super time sink
recommended
amazing and addictive game a must buy
recommended
fun game a strategy with a turn based system gamers that enjoy slower pace should go for this game 810
recommended
words cant describe how much i love this game but numbers can 810
recommended
in the words of many civ players just one more turn
recommended
great game
recommended
by far one of the greatest strategy games of all time the addictive nature of civ is in its unique ability to completely invest you into the civilization you create and grow through violent conquest or peaceful cunning the games near infinite number of ways to be played adds a replayability unrivaled by any game before it save some modern fpss as one of my top 5 games of all time i cannot recommend this game enough
recommended
its a great stetegic game
recommended
amazing game definitly worth buying
recommended
amazingly good strategy game if ure looking for great turnbased strategy game u dont have to search any longer this is the masterpiece of strategy games and with its 2 big dlcs its even better than just the base game if i only had more time to play it  it would be a great game if youre in prison ud have a lot of time to improve your strategy score 1010

i thought games like this wouldnt be something for me but i played two games so far and even tho i got my  kicked by gandhi im hooked now

recommended
just one more turn
recommended
this is the greatest game ever if you can develop a strategy to play you will not stop playing i play this and i cannot get bored their is no op things that can ruin the game even unique abilities that are called op have a small downside that if exploited is perfect i cannot think of any gaem breaking mechanic that will destroy it any time to come please buy this game and maybe i may be competing against you to build an empire that will stand the test of time another side not is that you will need to buy the expansions as they are worth it and are brilliant i brought them then couldnt go back to playing without them
recommended
great game love it a uniuqe expirience that requires stratigic thinking and planing turns wisely overall a fun game
recommended
this game is the best game i have ever played i just cant get enough
recommended
the gold standard for strategy more userfriendly and prettier than civ 4 with some great additions but lacking the stunning fall from heaven ii mod gods and kings is also recommended
recommended
this is the best game ever better than minecraft can spend many hours playing this amazing game get it now you can be many civilizations like poland russia germany england spain france rome greece venice babylon japan china mongolia askia zulus shoshone ireqouis mayans korea indonesia portugal morocco incas siam denmark austria netherlands ethiopia egypt america arabia carthage brazil and some i cant think of at the moment
recommended
definately worth the money when played with both the available addons
recommended
i have owned civ v now for almost two years and it has always been nothing but awesome even more awesome now with the brave new world dlc and the addition of religion spies congress tourism trade routes etc this has made the game even more interesting i lose track of hours on this building my economy while trying to build my army and not breaking the bank in the process watching other civilizations machinations with my spies and increasing border expansion to an alltime high without  off my neighbors it is indeed very complex and i am always learning new tips and tricks besides skyrim this is most definitely my favorite game on steam i give it 1010 cupcakes
recommended
spent hours building up greece to become a super power in the modern age only to be backstabbed by gahndi

civilization v is my favorite installment in the civ series especially with the two expansion packs buy them play them you will not regret it
recommended
sid meiers civilization v this game is the absolute best as far as realistic strategy games go the amount of depth they have put into the mechanics is mind boggling i will warn though that historical documentaries will never be the same for you after this game i cant tell you how many times i have been watching something on wwii and found my self pulling apart and analysing their strategies and in some cases implementing them into my own gameplay strategies
recommended
this game eats up my whole life i have stockholm syndrome for civ v
recommended
best game ever you are missing out if you dont have it dont be fooled by the price it is worth it
recommended
amazing game that consumes time
recommended
the best way to get rid of few days a week or even a winter be careful though
recommended
great game where you can play at your own pace
recommended
good game as it stands but the dlc makes it a much much better game
recommended
totally worth every penny
recommended
im addicted to this
recommended
this is my first civ game and let me just say that its made a great impression me and my friend just havent stoped playing dominating whole countries and having your whole empire crumble from one mistake this game is a must have the multiplayer is also a wonderful and fun time just make sure you bring friends and a glass of water cause things can get stressful 1010
recommended
its really good despite it being a turn type of game it is very fun and addicting to play <3 especially with friends

this game ate away my life 10 whoopi goldbergs

ghandi stole everything from me i attempted to please him with my gold and resources in return for mercy and peace it was not enough however after his conquests in america and mongolia ghandis bloodlust targeted my puny pathetic civilization he nuked all of my cities and razed all those who survived his giant death robots marched towards my capitol as i pleaded the great one to spare me he simply laughed and pillaged all the remaining land i had with my people starving and unhappy i had no choice but to vote for ghandi as world leader in the united nations in exchange for oranges gg ghandi gg 1010
recommended
its a good game why it takes away 3 gb free space from your hard drive it makes you experience feelings youve never experienced before as you watch the city you spend 9 hours building gets destroyed by enemy forces what real life is that a server you can get nuked by ghandi you can nuke ghandi back so overall great game should play it
recommended
historical figures controlling countries and living for thousands of years with nukes and giant robots from the future 1010
recommended
this is a good starter to get into the strategy based games its enjoyable and will suck up allot of your time without you realising it i dont feel that the addon packs are all that worth it though what is included with the game is more then enough
recommended
this is my favorite star wars sequel
recommended
do not play this game seriously its so awful if you value your time you cant play this its just too god dam amazing never ever ever play this game the one more turnturns into one more hour then one more afternoon stay away
recommended
the best turnbased strategy game i played they keep updating the game with large dlcs it costs money but that makes the game durable you never played a turnbased strategy game before well civilization 5 is a lot easier to play than the civilizaition games before just try it its awesome

good game as it stands but the dlc makes it a much much better game
recommended
totally worth every penny
recommended
this game is superbly time consuming and highly addictive indeed this game is a time machine game do not play this game it has high chance to ruin your life dont tell me that i didnt warn you
recommended
certainly one of the best strategy games from one of the best strategy game companies civilization 5 is a strategy game about controling an empire throughout human historyfrom the settling of the first towns to the near future and is fun in every part the game manages to have the same concepts at all times but still having different flavors depending on how far into a game you are great incredible amount of contentdoing everything the game has to offer is next to impossible on top of this the game is very addictive with stuff going on constantly to keep you hooked good game concepts are very well made with one exception and the game looks very nice and has a fitting art style combat is much more refined than past civ games ommiting the stack of death involving placing 30 units into one tile and bashing a city for minutes until one unit happens to win bad vanilla version of the game is lacking not to say its bad but the complete version for 50$ is far superior and 50 dollars is a lot compared to some other options also the happiness concept is a bit flawed having an unhappy civilization all but stops expanison causing cities to not grow and also giving you a economic and military penalty in order to keep a civilization happy you must find luxury resources which may be inacessible to you without a crazy amount of effort or trading or may be right on your doorstep also the ai seems to get a happiness bonus who rarely have a problem with the unruly masses its kind of unfair ugly the game is a bit unstable and is prone to crashing i cant play on full screen as my gpu becomes overused and the game needs to shut down other crashes are seemingly random with little to no explanation on why tldr its good crashes sometimes but its good 910 oh yeah id get the civilization sdk whatever that stands for along with this in the game tools section of steam its a game editing tool that allows for map creation and making your own mods
recommended
just one more turn said everyone who has ever played civ v played just one more turn no one who has stated the previous quote oh yeah and f ghandi

recommended
awesome game buy it and come play against me
recommended
this game is handsdown my favorite game ever created
recommended
ive never played any of the previous civ games and im a huge fan of catan a boardonline game it reminded me of so this automatically won me over civ 5 is more complex than catan in that it has more features to offer and its more organized less random and more relaxed whereas you can never predict what your opponents are gonna do in catan so it gets pretty intense you play a historical leader each civ comes with perks and choose how you interact with other leaders and their civilizations you can build whatever you want from armies to cities as the technology and resources become available to you throughout the centuries its addicting and so much fun i can only imagine the shenanigans and how awesome itd be to get a group of friends to play plus im really diggin a lot of the references made with the achievement names cant believe i didnt get into this sooner
recommended
imagine being locked in a room with big gaz g and razza while mr west films it all this is the opposite of that situation
recommended
i have a very soft spot for the civilization series civilization iii is to my memory the first game i ever played i have since played 2 the snes version of the original and this like the rest of the series its decently polished easy to learn has a lot of depth and is periliously addictive i didnt get into it as much as i did iii but thats probably just nostalgic bias if i had to complain i would say that the diploacy is rather limited and not being able to trade communications blows thankfully the rest of the game does it also i nuked beijing eleven times in a row and it still stood with two citzens who refused to die district 13 style 1110
recommended
if youve never played a civilization game before expect the learning curve to be a brick wall you may be a seasoned gamer whos used to playing on normal or hard on other games right from the getgo but if you are brand new to this series play on super easy mode first to learn and experiment before trying harder difficult levels that said once youve learned the basics of the game and are ready for more challenging experiences you will be greatly rewarded games typically last between 1 and 12 hours depending on the type of victory you seek and the pace you set in the beginning and you will never have the same experience twice giving this game a massive replay value there are always new maps to play on new allies to make new choices that will decide the games outcome and new diplomatic challenges to face civ v does a great job of landing you into a new game and you always feel satisfied by the games end even if you lose that by itself always leaves you wanting to play more even if you somehow get bored of playing in singleplayer vanilla mode multiplayer is offered and there are a plethora of mods out there to try so if youre patient and willing to learn i highly recommend this game and its expansion packs
recommended
just look at how many hours ive spend playing it
recommended
       total war

ive been saying to myself this is the last turn i swear but im just not able to quit these are the problems that show up as soon as you begin understanding the fundementals of this game sid meiers civlization v is a turnbased 4x game where you manage you cities and make sure your people are well fed and happy the goal in this game is to be the most progressive population on the planet you start out with a city that fits the population youve chosen from here on out you start exploring and building things with the first unit you will find things like ruins and barbarian camps the barbarians are your first real enemy you will have to try to fight them off while progressing your first city when you start expanding alot you find out that the barbarians are not a real threat anymore in fact you will be alot more busy with the other populations on the map the other populations can be friendly but also an enemy this is where diplomacy comes in some leaders of the populations may trick you and create traps to backstab you after a while so you have to be carefull on what you decide whats best you also get to trade and discuss with these leaders for instance you could trade a luxury that your population wishes for after a couple of hundered turns youll get the hang of it and start liking the game alot for me its the progressing that makes me hooked to this game its the mentality of just finishing this one thing that makes it soo addicting to me i find it to be one of the best games i have every played this is the first civilization game i ever played but now i regret that i never played the previous parts of this series all in all a great game i highly recommend it
recommended
this game is ruining my life
recommended
gandhinukedgermany10 would play for all eternity
recommended
if you are going to buy this game you need the brave new world dlc once you have that it will be great expirience i recommend this game extensivly 910
recommended
one more turn i swearthis time its truwait  ghandi has a  load of tanks at my capitals border
recommended
where did all my time go
recommended
great game really good community behind it it has a massive amount of replay value i have spent countless hours playing and am still not bored
recommended
civilization 5 is possibly one of the most diverse strategy games to be released in the past 10 years often you are faced with killing everyone in the game just to win but sid meirs civilization 5 lets you choose how to win let it be cultural diplomatic science or if youre a fan of eliminating the competition domination civilization 5 puts you in the seat of historical leaders with unique building or units and also unique traits that relate to how they ruled or dominated in the past replay value is a huge strongpoint for this game the randomly generated maps with customizable options will drop you into a fresh experience every time you play a match the game also features maps such as europe mediterranean and earth the maps have accurate placements of geographic features that correlate to the real world landscape most importantly for me about civilization is the huge knowledge you can earn from playing the game learn how leaders commanded their armies and how they rushed for continents to settle on natural wonders and world wonders have descriptions that tell you history about them all in all civ is an amazing game that i would recommend everyone to buy even if youre not a huge strategy buff this will definitely make you think twice
recommended
love it
recommended
this game will entertain you for hours 
recommended
this game made me hate all countries availible
recommended
you ghandi are you serious trying to declare war on me you
recommended
once you know how to play you could basically spend hours playing without even getting bored but if you think that the game is still missing a little something the workshop is full of mods that could spice your game up
recommended
if you want to spend all of your life on a game that you probably wont like at first but end up getting addicted to get this game
recommended
just one more turn then ill write the review
recommended
well i got this game expecting amazing stuff and what came out of what pure amazingness and it made me poop like litteraly all over my walls i had hire 400 men to clean off the poop it was so deeply stained into the wall like they didnt think they could save the house but i told them to believe just like i believed in civilization v they cheered they roared in the awe i was presenting of amazingness then they got to work and within 4 years they cleaned my house into a palace of versailes and then and then only did i poop all over the walls again knowing of the legendary of amazingness civilization v  it is also teaches strategy which also helped the men clean the walls good luck players 
recommended
very entertaining like a good facebookgame without hours of wait
recommended
i really enjoy civ 5 it is a good mix of strategy and action i think anyone could have fun with this game
recommended
i enjoy playing civ 5 you can take you time you can also win by timewar etc 1010 good game to play when you get bored and when you have nothing to do so you should try to enjoy it as much as i have
recommended
at first i really diddnt think i would like this game it just diddnt seem in my style the only reason i bought it in the first place is because all my friends bought it on the humble bundle anyways i tried the game out and i was immidiently hooked in the first week i had more game time on it then even tf2 the game is extremely user friendly and real easy to learn if you put your time into it i absolutly love the content in the game even though the dlc may be a bit pricey all in all i highly recommend this game to anyone who has enough time on there hands and loves strategy
recommended
this game swagalicious
recommended
thanks to the streamlined experience and some simplification civ v makes for the best multiplayer experience out of the series unfortunately for the same reason civ iv is probably the better single player experience as there feels to be more depth and you have all the time in the world to finish your turn vanilla can feel too restrictive and frustrating due to some of these changes but brave new world brings around some exciting end game features meaning that runaway civs arent always guaranteed to win past t150 or so if you got a group of likeminded friends who like strategy board games like risk or axis and allies i cannot recommend this game enough
recommended
this game ruins friendships
recommended
what more can be said about this game than what others have already said this game is a massive time sink and thats a good thing its a just one more turn type game that will leave you realizing that its 430 in the morning
recommended
sid meiers civilization v what can you say about game or the civilization series that hasnt been said already if your a fan of turn based strategy games this is a no brainier get it if your thinking of getting civ 5 and havent played the others get it this game probably has to be one of the most addictive games of all time
recommended
definitely tons of fun with friends its very time consuming so sometimes its hard to keep a large group together in one save let alone complete one despite that though worth every penny and tons of enjoyable hours spent on this game
recommended
i have spent over 400 hours playing this game and it just never gets old it is especially engaging once you by gods & kings and brave new world dlcs which add religion ideology and dozens of new leaders this game is simply a must buy
recommended
civ 5 is one of those games were you will say oh i will play for 5 or maybe 10 minutes just to see how your empire is doing 8 hours later youve just won the space race and have to get ready for school this is what this game is like its always just one more turn alright just one more turn please and you keep going because you want to discovere flight so you can bomb your enermies from the sky and so on there is just something magical about the game the soundtrack is just divine and the graphics if youve got a good enough pc are amazing in terms of gameplay massive changes have made since the civ 4 days for example you can no longer just pile unites on top of each orther and in stead of sqaures you now move in hexes these new features that may seem small but change the game in a big way the game is with out a doubt is worth your money i give sid meiers civilization v a 1010 enjoy
recommended
an amazing game and great dlc recommend this 100%
recommended
its really fun

people who are actually good at reviews will have already done a better job at explaining what makes this game fun me personally i just like ghandis method of acheiving peace through a scarcity of living enemies

incredible game full of strategy im really impressed by the game it is fun and never gets boring you can retry the game loads of times with another nation you can play with a friend you can grow your town to be the feared and most destructive country or as the most peaceful and calm country do buy it its an amazing and well made game
recommended
really really really really fun strategy game turn based if you need a singleplayer game that will keep you busy for as long as your brain remains inside your head this is it singleplayer offers nearly limitless gameplay youll only quit after you realize your strategy is the same thing game after game however if you mix up your strategy its like playing a whole new game or at least something like that eh worst part of the game is its slow load screen to the main menu even and all the paid dlcs still its worth whatever the initial asking price is at the moment its worth at least $30
recommended
great turnbased game amazing graphics and infinite possibilities and endings
recommended
while i still think civ iii was the crowning achievement in this series i cant dismiss how good this iteration is start it up and get ready for hours to fly by

recommended
a very addicting and absolutely fantastic game if you can pick up both map packs with the game itself for a reduced price it is definitely worth getting the content and ai tweaks and changes make a big difference when playing even though i have played only 103 hrs when writing this review there are still many many different civilisations i have yet to play if you are new to civilisation games there are many tutorials on steam to look through the ingame tutorials are pretty decent as well

recommended
addicted i need help cant stop just one more turn im a renewb to the genre so i wont go into technical and comparison to any other newbs i recommend checking out the steam community guides if you find yourself overwhelmed by the plethora of setup options and want some frustration saving strategy hints totally worth a little reading time very few games out there keep me playing after the main objective has been met i cant even properly describe why why i cant stop once you get past the initial learning curve it becomes seductively simple and almost hypnotic youll be all like hey i can have this running and do a turn here and there while im getting on with something else 4 hours later ill do it in a minute just one more turn graphically its a pleasant enough mask for the clever mechanics many ways to play and win nice array of buildings and units stealth and nuclear missile being my favourites oh hello looking round my border are we boom shiq ill melt your faces off and rub my butt all over your tiles the ui is uncluttered and easy to find your way around tooltips and tutorial messages and ingame help are surprisingly helpful the community is active and awesomely creative the achievements are plentiful but stretched across dlcs recommended for people with time to spare

it all started when our protagonist civ 5 woke up in a pumpkin patch it was the fourth time it had happened feeling ridiculously exasperated civ 5 groped a sock thinking it would make him feel better but as usual it did not unexpectedly he realized that his beloved  of truth was missing immediately he called his friend leroy jenkins civ 5 had known leroy jenkins for plus or minus one million years the majority of which were sassy ones leroy jenkins was unique he was intelligent though sometimes a little dimwitted civ 5 called him anyway for the situation was urgent leroy jenkins picked up to a very happy civ 5 leroy jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating yet otters usually earnestly grimace after mating he had no idea what that meant he was only concerned with distracting civ 5 why was leroy jenkins trying to distract civ 5 because he had snuck out from civ 5s with the  of truth only four days prior it was a saucy little  of truth how could he resist it didnt take long before civ 5 got back to the subject at hand his  of truth leroy jenkins sighed relunctantly leroy jenkins invited him over assuring him theyd find the  of truth civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately after hanging up the phone leroy jenkins realized that he was in trouble he had to find a place to hide the  of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully he figured that if civ 5 took the truck he had take at least eleven minutes before civ 5 would get there but if he took the  then leroy jenkins would be alarmingly screwed before he could come up with any reasonable ideas leroy jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his  of truth leroy jenkins sighed not again he thought feeling frustrated he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them apparently this was an adequate deterrentthe discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket squealing with discontent he exhaled with relief thats when he heard the  rolling up it was civ 5 o0o as he pulled up he felt a sense of urgency he had had to make an unscheduled stop at walmart to pick up a 12pack of pencils so he knew he was running late with a calculated leap civ 5 was out of the  and went indiscriminately jaunting toward leroy jenkinss front door meanwhile inside leroy jenkins was panicking not thinking he tossed the  of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano leroy jenkins was concerned but at least the  of truth was concealed the doorbell rang come in leroy jenkins sassily purred with a careful push civ 5 opened the door sorry for being late but i was being chased by some funnysmelling maniac in a vette he lied its fine leroy jenkins assured him civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where leroy jenkins had hidden the  of truth leroy jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness uhh can i get you anything he blurted but civ 5 was distracted without warning leroy jenkins noticed a selfish look on civ 5s face civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak whats that smell leroy jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when civ 5 asked this in a moment of disbelief he realized that he had hidden the  of truth right by his oscillating fan whwhat i dont smell anything a lie a insensitive look started to form on civ 5s face he turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place thththose are just my grandmas mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies she uhdropped em by here earlier civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgementthen before leroy jenkins could react civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it the  of truth was plainly in view civ 5 stared at leroy jenkins for what what mustve been four seconds unexpectedly leroy jenkins groped wildly in civ 5s direction clearly desperate civ 5 grabbed the  of truth and bolted for the door it was locked leroy jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle if only you hadnt been so protective of that thing none of this would have happened civ 5 he rebuked leroy jenkins always had been a little insensitive so civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option he needed to escape before leroy jenkins did something crazy like start chucking mittens at him or something all of a sudden he gripped his  of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window diving headlong through the glass panels leroy jenkins looked on blankly what the hell that seemed excessive the other door was open you know silence from civ 5 and to think i varnished that window frame nine days agoit never ends suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for civ 5 oh you okay still silence leroy jenkins walked over to the window and looked down civ 5 was gone o0o just yonder civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind leroy jenkinss place civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident and was starting to lose strength another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared having caught wind of the  of truth one by one they latched on to civ 5 already weakened from his injury civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his  of truth about seven hours later civ 5 awoke his butt throbbing it was dark and civ 5 did not know where he was deep in the humid desert civ 5 was abundantly lost a few minutes later he remembered that his  of truth was taken by the aligators but at that point he was just thankful for his life thats when to his horror a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield it was the alpha aligator civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into civ 5s face with a faint groan the life escaped from civ 5s lungs but not before he realized that he was a failure less than two miles away leroy jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the  of truth my precious he cried as he reached for a sharpened spoon with a heroic thrust he buried it deeply into his neck as the room began to fade to black he thought about civ 5 wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him but he would die alone that day all that remained was the  of truth that had turned them against each other ultimately causing their demise and as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawns reddish glare all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come our heroes wouldve lived unhappily ever after but they were too busy being dead so no one lived forever after the end

this game was surprisingly good i dont like strategy games but this one was awesome

this installment of the civilization franchise has the best gameplay you will find in any civilization game guiding an empire from fledgling tribal city into world spanning empire is amazing and does not get stale even over many iterations of founding and building nations excellent graphics help add to the game and the fact that leonard nimoy does loads of voicework in the game is great overall highly recommend the game and the expansion packs for it including gods & kings and brave new world which add new civilizations scenarios and units that keep the game interesting

couldnt write an articulate review have to play my next turn

civ 5 is probably one of my all time favorite games though not as in depth as other civ games civ 5 is an amazing game worth playing reply value is incredible every civilization is unique and different in many ways and never seems to get boring thanks to a wide variety of difficulty settings and expansion packs i highly recommend this to anyone who is new to strategy games or to any experienced veteran out there i also recommend the expansion packs to improve gameplay civ 5 to say the least is a truly remarkable piece of art and quite addicting at that the ai may be a little funky at times but that is to be expected for nearly every game i would pay 50 dollars for this game evidently that was the price when it first came out it is just that good and that is saying something for myself because i am quite frugal and prefer to only purchase games when they are on sale this is one of those games that you will be up till 4 am in the morning telling yourself just one more turn

sid meiers civ 5 is the latest forray into civilization building from this acclaimed series it is also the first in the series that i have played so my review of the game is unbiased by the previous installments many have said that civ 3 is the best or that civ 4 is the only one to play but ive found that civ 5 is an excellent game that stands quite easily on its own merits and is definitely worth a play by anyone that enjoys a long drawn out turn based civilization management game pros wonderfully polished many civilizations to choose from great music extremely variable gameplay cons some dx bugs resource intensive laptops tend to lag might spend too much time playing this game a relaxing game that you can dump hours into this is one of the best multiplayer games that ive had the joy of playing and singleplayer is also a blast the expansion gods and kings while expensive is totally worth purchasing the other dlc is good but since theres so much of it wait for a sale a

ive played csgo for a thousand hours plus i think ive clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughtsinsightsfeedback of the game if there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game it would be for two reasons firstly i have to say that the csgo community is horrible people show no signs of mercy to those who are new including myself at times there are plenty of rude people of course ive met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob  not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they dieddidnt get a killfor fun secondly the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now these people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual fps and also in competitive mode especially for smurfs i know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them and as for hackers there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services these people are simply a real pain to the csgo community need i say more csgo honestly is good fun i do love csgo i have spent many good hours with friends meeting new people and killing chickens however the harsh reality of the csgo is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that youre no good along with a good bunch of hackerssmurfs who ruins your gaming experience if you cant handle the harshness of the csgo community dont start playing it however if you choose to enter the csgo world alone good luck i hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades until valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs especially in competitive mode i will not recommend it suggestion to counter smurfs if the ip address has been in a csgo server before heshe will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode edit valves implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins additional note to the few who have disagreed with my review because its the community youre unhappy about not the game heres what i have to say i strongly believe for a game like csgo in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not it is the community that makes the game whole and who it is especially for a game like csgo i highly doubt people buy csgo to play offline modebot matches though i understand your point of view and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanismsfuntionalities like movementgun bullet mechanicsmatchmaking however for my review my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surfacetrailers at first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all however once you get into the game i believe youll change your opinion if you still disagree i think its either you havent been exposed enough or youre just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches @shadowdance youre welcome you gave me the push to write this reply cheers fellow comrades

the review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings notice i have 3k hours i have been playing counterstrike since 15 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the grand theft auto series or the battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love if you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that cs has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there unlike games like call of duty or battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times yes it happens but to be good in counterstrike global offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective this is the ultimate teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them i stayed up all night til 7am to watch either dreamhack or esl forget which one that one match alone had about 300000 viewers whereas cs source was barely keeping their head above water with professional tournys and teams in their day so whats the problem the up until just recently awesome people over at valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins cases keys taxes on items we sell on the marketplace passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15 i dont think you will find a single player in cs that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even equal to cs and its replayability for $15 that being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking ie wallhackingaimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 499 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem now you think about valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be many people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game just to hack and boost their friends this is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me i literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians i am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in csgo everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on always be a new account on the other team what is their excuse oh im just smurfing you can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not 612 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins nowadays 910 overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or 20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt possibly be hacking hackers do this because they know there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever valve states that anyone vacbanned will not be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever so tell me why during one of the major cs go tournaments that just passed pasha from the pro team virtus pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match simply said no i am not hacking and got his account unbanned if he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right wrong it is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshopnot exactly certain on the details even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away the major point i am trying to make on this subject is that valve makes millions on us for each skin key case tax on the items we sell in game operation pass and copy of the game we buy and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system thats like the nfl making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught if you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 123 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being smurfing smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have fun its pathetic and lowers counterstrike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on pc we must not forget it did pave the way for games like cod valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game if that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would not recommend counterstrike again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to cs its not something i can easily do valve knows this and valve is taking advantage of us end of story

dear counterstrike players after a long period playing this game 1000h i think i have the advantage to write a better review than my last first i want to say thank you valve for making a nice game like counterstrike global offensive but there are some things valve has to change really fast 1 cheating there are more and more cheaters every fu day the vacsystem isnt as save as it should be i hope valve is working on it 2 ddosing i think the valveservers should be very save but then there is the ddosing how is it able to get the ips from your opponents this fast and ddos them please fix the serversecure 3 smurfing through all those steamsales you get more and more smurfs highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it i think they should make an ipbased system where the rank is linked to the ip or something like this 4 patches patch after patch the game is getting worse they nerf every weapon till the weapon isnt playable anymore with the maps you have the same problem 5 serverproblems also steamserver steam and valve arent able to fix their serverproblems so the game isnt playable because of laggs and disconnects also the cooldown you can get is very unfair this is fu s 6 community the community isnt as good as i hoped most of the people are pretty unfriendly over all counterstrike isnt playable anymore and the higher the rank the more hackers you get please fix the things i listed above and make the game playable again and i know that valve cant fix the community but i hope the community will get better ps im from germany so there are maybe some spelling mistakes

counterstrike global offensive is a brilliant game there is no doubt about it defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today however a game should be played purely for the sake of fun counterstrike global offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun but whether or not you actually manage to get any fun out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state simply put counterstrike global offensive is a modernised version of the counterstrike everybody knows and loves only this time it has a ranking system and balanced matchmaking so that you always get a fair game regardless of your skills  sounds awesome right too bad that at the moment matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair  i will elaborate but first i just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic i am not here to dispute that fact but rather that a game that relies heavily on its community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game see the people that dishout endless tutorials and tips such as warowl & 3kliksphillip for example 9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating lets not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anticheat measures are making very little difference especially when some of the most proffessional and famous counterstrike global offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had vac bans in the past and while that doesnt necessarily mean they are still cheating it is not out of the bounds of possibility another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that arent hormonal teenagers or prepubescent children that do nothing but give out grief racial and or homophobic slurs then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team but hey if you play this game with the right people it is still a great experience whether you win or lose i have met some great people in my time playing unfortunately these great people are outnumbered by the bad ones at least that was my experience i still believe that the good outweighs the bad just ignore the idiots if you can even though it will be hard if they resort to teamkilling and intentional friendly fire i guarantee youll be using the block communication feature a lot  i know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isnt very good or just new to the game altogether but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else instead of kicking and griefing them try helping them instead everybody was new to counterstrike at some point in time remember that so until valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game i cant really recommend it regardless of how much i like the game itself its situations like this that make me wish steams review system had a mixed option cause it really does pain me to click no for a game that is fun and competetive counterstrike global offensive is one to buy but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking if youre having a lucky day you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go but lets just say the odds arent exactly in your favor if one day the matchmaking has vastly improved then i will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves but until then im afraid i cant by the way to be genuinely good at counterstrike global offensive  you must own at least one expensive weapon skin or better yet a $300 virtual knife they seem to be the major factor in judging ones skills these days the short version amazing game but ruined by its community

they say that its easier to tear someone down than it is to build someone up its true its ing true how no one does anything about it they go with it and call you a  or ing garbage and so on no one cares about the kid who just sits there doing nothing wrong and gets called that no one cares about the one who isnt as good as the rest and sits in spawn while his team constantly calls him gay and a  head and constantly pointing every single thing that hes done wrong no one bothers to give lending advice or compliment what good hes done they just tear down the foundation of him they dont bother mending to the walls of the household theyd rather fire the cannons at it they would rather choke you with aspersion than give just one compliment the world would much rather lead the child to end of his short life and throw away all his progress and the [wonderful] things he would accomplish later on in life the world is sick to me i just wish people would cast aside the brutes club and wield the carpenters hammer the game itself is good however the community sucks

i want to like this game i really do but theres just a few quirks i cant get past nothing about gameplay or anything like that for whatever reason i dont feel like coming home and playing csgo for hours as i do with other games also the community is really mean to new players for some odd reason my first competetive game i had people calling me a  just because wasnt going to the right place when im the last alive and i lose a gunfight i get kicked for nothing in particular and when im playing with my friends and i dont understand how i havent hit the person my friends tell me dont question it and if you learned how to play you wouldnt get killed all the time the problem is how do you learn how to play when nobody is nice enough to help you out ps there are occasionally the nice ones in a lobby but they are not the majority edit i did play some deathmatch and i thought i did pretty well even some of my friends who are vets said that i should start playing competetive

first off im not sure when trolls smurfs and hacks began to become the norm but the game is broken they put it on sale for 500 kids buy it just to hack it valve knows they dont care and all we do is buy buy buy skins i mean 40000 for a knife skin wtf didnt we used to be able to get those for free the guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly hacking is big business they took 12 name tags from me all because of 1 offcolor gun name meanwhile vulgarity far worse than my gun name is allowed to cheat troll and make the game unplayable because its funny to watch people get  and valve does nothing but put the game on sale and kids rememer when you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 6500  35 or 50 for the season pass you set what the market will bear thus making games more expensive for us and limiting how much fun you can really have with it cuz if you cant afford the season pass you dont get all that content csgo is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money and make them happy they did it maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game 1 for rank 1 for smurfing and 1 for hacking

do you want a fastpaced multiplayer fps that is riddled with inconsistent crap netcode that readily bends over a barrel and presents a jasmine scented  which pooches open in anticipation for every twobit hacker on the internet well then this is for you do you enjoy an endless torrent of  hackers teamkillers smurfs gobshites with broken microphones who will readily spout an everlasting supply of foreign swear words while youre trying to listen for the enemy thats right nothing adds to the challenge more than having to watch out for  and traitors on your own team laggy noskill morons from farflung lands who are impossible to hit thats right hit your router with a hammer and fill the ports with kitkat wrappers because your half second ping will save you son thats called lag compensation which gives almost total invincibility to anyone with an internet connection that has no business whatsoever playing games like this this was once a good game these days kdr stands for kids s and russians toxicity from top to bottom but surely at the higher levels you get away from all that yeah check out the regular reports of pro players throwing matches for money using hacks at toptier tournament level and acting like 12year olds banwaves are good for about a day if that just to give you a glimpse of what the game could be dont even waste your time reporting griefers and hackers if you want to do something more useful open notepad type some russian swear words you will know them all by now then save the document and throw it into your recycle bin avoid at all cost play a mans game let the children have this one and buy arma 3 instead find a good well adminned server ping greater than 300 boom see ya vlad mouthy teenager boom see ya timmy coming soon yet another halfbaked cackhanded attempt at balancing the pistols

edit i cant completely reccomend csgo again because there are too many problems mm is still a ing joke casual is just a cluster and dm is  if you wanna play csgo go get cevo faceit or go on the community servers csgo is still broken as  with ladder hitboxes and other  that volvo doesnt care about because they are too busy making new animations for knives and creating new operations _ 310 rating still stands this is a honest review of the game counter strike global offensive or csgo lets just start off by saying that previous counter strike games really have been amazing now csgo is the newest installment in the series what seems and is a fun game is plauged with problems lets start off by the community the csgo community is one of the most toxic communities out there just as bad as the dota2 community they will put down new players troll and just overall have bm while playing the game really valve does nothing to punish griefers and others so the trolling will never really end another problem is hackers hackers plauge the world of csgo at all ranks and skill levels some may be blatant and some may be more conservative point is that valve has really not done anything to fight hackers vac sucks and takes weeks to ban a hacker while overwatch has been implemented its a time consuming process that cant always be accurate because of the low price of the game hackers can make endless accounts and continue to feed valve the 15 dollars for csgo so that they can continue to ruin other peoples time valve really has ignored the community in many ways aswell not implementing 128 tick servers adding stupid stuff like music intros to players and not doing productive things like fixing exploits or overpowered things like grenade tagging a massive problem is also skins they may look pretty but they ruin the game now i understand that valve will never take skins out of the game because it is a massive amount of revenue for them but skins really only lead to professional players throwing matches nothing can really be done about this as much as the big orgas organizations try to stop it from happening players will find a way to do it and will throw for skins when competing in small tournaments smurfs are considered a problem by some but i see no feaseable way to stop them so i will not be talking about that surrendering is also an issue teams playing competitive matchmaking can surrender a game but only if one of the players decides to sacrifice himself and abandon the match getting a cooldown when playing against a hacker in addition to getting aimbotted time after time 1 player must be punished for abandoning the match in order for the team to forfeit this game can be good but valve is not doing what they need to do to fix the issues and instead adds their cash grabs to the game the issues will persist and more and more players will leave the game this game had great potential and is fun at first until you play enough then you ake notice and you wait for every patch that is supposed to fix things just to see that it is a new set of skins for some new stupid collection today i will be leaving csgo maybe not forever but until they fix their issues i will not be coming back tldr great game with tons of issues that valve gives zero s about rating 310

its surely the best cs so far if you can overlook the fact that competitive matchmaking ranks mean nearly nothing as well as if you can deal with being kicked and consequentially put in matchmaking cooldown by a team of four people you can also invest few thousands of dollars to buy fancy weapons a good game in the end but only if you play it with friends edit 31 may 2015 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv54i480dw23g

please read before voting this down i cannot recommend it because this game destroys people its a good game but at a terrible cost no im not some antigaming freak i love games but truth said this is a great game but it will kill you inside matchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team when its easy and you wreck havoc its too easy boring unsatisfying if its challenging and hard or youre loosing you keep worrying about your stats skill and rank you are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry either at yourself or the rest of your teamthat other happens more often if you live in europe this game will only make you racist you will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you or refusing to communicate with you maybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually dont care but once you try competetive you look at casual with disgust the better you get the more hateful towards other players you will be you will not remember how bad you used to be you will hate all the noobs skrubs and casuals you will judge people by their skins weapons of choice and headshot ratio everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater where is the fun in all this i ask you can be proud of yourself when you win or survive in an action where you were meant to die but each and every accomplishment youll get will make you crave for more and at one point you wont feel much from winning but you will feel a lot from loosing

imagine after playing a game for almost 13 years watching it evolve get better finding skills to be better than the average pub player then the ultimate version of the game comes out it allows for competitive ranked play at the touch of the button you practically explode with joy and you play and you tweak  you find the right mouse sensitivity  you learn the guns you learn from your mistakes  you play with friends good and bad and then you notice during a competitive ranked game that 3 members on the other team or hacking speed hacks hacks that dont register direct hits even killshots can be ignoredplayers using programs and hardware to intentionally lag themselves back behind cornersyou feel like all that hardwork you put into the game has become worthless you feel let down by the people who brought you the only franchise youve ever put over 2000 hours of your life into you justifably feel cheated and thats why i cant reccomend this game its great it really is but the best part of it isnt secure from the same hacks that have been used for so long its heartbreaking valve you dropped the ball please secure your servers

dont play csgo if you cant tolerate cheaters racism hatred amongst players even your own teammates and under average servers focusing on the quality of servers my experience has been a 510 satisfaction with them even though my connection is less than 50 ping with minimal packet loss choke and var i have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a full clip now you might say im just bad but ive been playing this game for almost 2 monthsyes thats more than 1400 hours and the games physics are like my third hand by now this is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad youre better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as esea that have decent servers and more often than not cooperative teammates moreover the competitive servers are full of edgy underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own regardless of your skill there is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you cant communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round nevertheless thats bound to happen in any game but its been on the rise on csgo servers since its debut in august 2012 however if you can ignore all of which ive told you so far and youre fond of shooters different from call of duty and battlefield then this game is for you

i grew up on the series love and hate but it always had some magic and made me come back when i got the opportunity to play the csgo closed beta it was amazing top notch stuff guns had a great feel back then no stupid stickers or skins no failed updates even the final product released a year ago was good since the introducing of the skins performance went to the drain bear in mind the source engine is 10 years old now stability is a word of a past and the cod effect among newcomers is at an alltime high this is not even remotely satisfying if you find 16 or css dear dont swap otherwise you will live to regret it youll become a twisted shadow of your former self incapable of gaming on that proper level ever again when you go back out of frustration the number of cheaters and the way the supportdev team does not care about this product  makes me want to vomit welcome to community tested payed beta 71014 update if your behinds hurt i feel sorry for you focus on getting them random headshots we all get but never admit and no i do not mean the ones that kill us but the ones that we frag mid air mid run which should not even happen but yes you call that skill cause it hurts the ego

engine still broken after idk how long stopped playing when the buggy as hell css was released try to get back into it but the registry and netcode in this version of the game is still so awful that its nearly unplayable the community consists of diehard tryhards and people who havent the slightest clue as to what they are doing ranks are useless and baseless as it falls under a wl ratio rather than a kd ratio like its forefather cal with this release valve continues to make money off of other peoples ideas with stupid things like gun skins and lacks the originality it once had with its release of hl1 and 2 all in all this game is a huge waste of money and does not give anything to the modding community that once made this game thrive forgetting the average age of a gamer and turning its back on the people that made cs a once world renouned title

i really want to recommend this game its a more immersive shooter than any of the call of duty series and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates when the game goes well its buckets of fun unfortunately i cannot recommend this game to newcomers there are many reasons for this first of all unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesserplayed game modes so anything but casualcompetitive youre going to die a lot and then you wait you watch your uncooperative anonymous russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion if you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head literally tracing the bullet into their cranium only to see that it doesnt register the hit due to the substandard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers andor your west country internet connection thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation if your internet connection is not the problem you may try using esea or faceit to play your competitive matches with so you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers or faff about on faceit waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round after a few bad experiences ive decided that faceit isnt worth the hassle playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers but mainly these things called smurfs put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account then make secondthirdfourth accounts to play against easier opponents its that simple yet its infuriating and gamedestroying for us lower ranked players and when you discover this in a competitive game your only choices are to stay there and endure it gradually losing your sanity or take a competitive ban if youre lucky enough to have decent friends they may just kick you from the game sparing you of either choice having played almost 3 solid weeks worth of the game in total i have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain but we still play together for the social side this is when i can recommend the game when youve already played a lot of csgo and have many friends that also play the game if youre new and have less patience than a special forces marksman youre going to hate this game i hope that if you decide to play this game you can take my advice with a pinch of salt as i am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment however if you too go ape you only have yourself to blame also look out for skin collecting ive been caught by it it saps a lot of your money and is literally an addiction not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine one thats ultimately utterly pointless

over 600 hours on csgo over 13 years playing cs in general in older versions of cs if you are high skilled you can easily take down 5 low skilled players in this version you are lucky to get onto the 3rd guy game is all about luck not skill based like all previous versions of the game ranked up to dmg with over 200 wins in competetive and i can say this game should be released as a 5 person coop you should only play comp when you have 4 other friends who you know wont troll you regardless of their skill level its better to have that than random teammates the hit reg in this game is absolutely nothing compared to previous versions due to the low bandwidth allocated to the gaming servers setup by valve the skin system is nothing but a huge money grabbing scheme which no doubt has earnt a huge amount more than the game sales alone as with all games you can trade in this one is full of scammers constantly daily trying to scam your high value items from you procede with extreme caution when making trades with anyone you dont know this game promotes gambling to under 18s with the skin drop system costing each skin a certain price with a possible return on investment gambling sites are regulated and usually offer around 85% return on your gambling in the long run i believe there is no regulation of this system and theres plenty of 12yr old kids out there throwing away hundreds into this system alot of reviews have complained about cheaters this isnt such a bad problem nowa days as the overwatch system has taken over vac in the competetive section of the game blatent cheaters are caught and banned for 1 year quite quickly and the players that support and judge in this system are to thank overall the game its self has a great system but just isnt being used to its full potential allocate more time and money please valve rating vs previous versions 310 rating vs other fps games 810 community rating 310 price rating 310 even on sale this should be f2p with a subscription to comp games with vip benefits

ive held this view of csgo for quite some time but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts ive been playing cs for many many years  starting in the early 2000s through to present day this time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages enjoying leveling my character in wc3 mods smashing heads in deathmatch surfing backwards longjumping bhopping played in quals for wcg competed in cevo and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments ive enjoyed cs from 11 to 16 cz css and also csgo no this does not make me a better player than you and no this does not mean i know everything it simply means that i have spent a lot of time playing different titles of counterstrike have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases there are a handful of things that really upset me with csgo and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after i have first played the game these issues i consider to be gamebreaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play i enjoy cs because there is a skill curve if you want to be the best at the game you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent  this was certainly true in all other cs games i have played but not csgo csgo feels like it is a game of luck and chance as the game stands it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or mm is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game hitboxes are not lagcompensated to follow the model of a player when jumping hitboxes are not lagcompensated to follow the model of a player when crouching hitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb aimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lagcompensated if you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick server this is how most events will play out you see an enemy jump you shoot the enemy and get no hits you see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle you shoot thin air blood appears and you get a headshot kill you see an enemy standing there you shoot his chest you get no hit and then he crouches instantly you see an enemy standing there you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot because he was crouching on the server you see an enemy shoot first die and get no hits watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof you are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb you crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times slowly one by one you get no hits and die all of these aspects of the game i consider extremely gamebreaking the fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves yeah that has happened to me on a number of occasions just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed in its current state the game rewards people for not aiming  aka good players in the game need only aim at the ground run and shoot and theyll likely get a headshot because as long as you dont aim at the model that you see there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit the only one of these bugs that existed in counterstrike source pre2010 ob update was the hitboxes on the planting animation an example of a bug that i do not consider gamebreaking but extremely frustrating is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player for some reason after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this a feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch that is a huge disappointment people standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them but the players screen will be completely black this was an unintentional metachange when trying to fix oneway smokes and this new issue has existed for months now the game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them throw a smoke down wait until it starts to fade teammate resmokes  rinse repeat and run down the timer retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who cant capitalise on the blindcriple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible what a horrible meta change why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago 3d sound is nonexistent in csgo it is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind this game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny i find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems i see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable itd be nice if people were able to draw the devs attention to these issues and press for a resolution

counterstrike is a good game that is past its time the recent addition of weapon skins as prize drops does not improve it as much as it cheapens the overall experience as much fun as ive had playing counterstrike over the years i now feel that new games such as insurgency improve upon the formula and offer a similar but richer experience

no just no i love this game its really good but im giving it a thumbs down not just is the matchmaking system broken and the community is full of russians and 10 year olds there are countless cheater and smurfers oh you wanted to play a game without constant unbalance and wallhacking jerks well youre in the wrong place the community is toxic wanting to kick you because you decide to save or make one single mistake when you ask to get kicked for having to go or whatnot nobody gives a  and youre doomed with your ban make one small mistake like accidentically flicking your mouse and boom kicked the smurfers are stealing kills and ruining the game everytime i play with one im just planting the bomb while he gets aces and if im lucky i get to kill one player per second round or so when theres a hacker on my team and i insist to kick him my teammates give two  and wont kick him for the sake of winning also vac and overwatch ing sucks i see hackers everyday and vac takes it sweet  time and lets them ruin the game for as many players as possible before they get banned on which they create a new account to continue cheating dont even let me begin with knives ing $300 for a knife i do agree in the skins looking cool and all that but seriously why not spend that money on upgrading your computer so you can admire your knives in better quality and the case unboxing is ridiculous i cannot count how many negevs i have gotten from spending $50 on cases on top of that the matchmaking always puts me with 12 year olds im sick of kids saying fokk yau bish in the worst accent possible the workshop is also horrible theres nothing but awps aks and m4s most skins doesnt even have a purple variant and i honestly dont see why there are 6 covert awps and 0 covert mac10s overall great gameplay nice graphics and performace interesting game modes toxic community constant smurfers & hackers unstable matchmaking ridiculous anticheat system 410 im going back to tf2 at least people are mature there and hacking is pointless

in my opinion this game is still very young and undeveloped and all the hate against russians is stupid i mean im not one to talk here i hate them sometimes aswell i realised something when i was playing one day the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game where rank is more importand than having fun how valve changed cs for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing cs 16 or css back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the servers where flooded with ads i really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with now people only care about how big your rank is and how expensive your skins are where are the good old times to me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustnt recommend it for players from cs 16 or css sure there are different mods but people mostly play competitive and try to force their rank down your throat

i bought this game with high hopes and regards from the commmunity yes i may only have 8 hours into this game but that doesnt mean i can not give my opinion community i bought this game on a whim i heard from everybody about how good it is so i decided to give it a try my first game i had to listen to some guy yell at me because i did not know what i was doing i quickly just brushed it off and went to another lobby after the game i encountered the same exact thing the community complains about how outsiders look at the game and that is because the community drives them away dont get me wrong there is the occasional nice guygirl that will help new people but they are few and far between do not even get me started on the cash grab that they call crates and weapon skins gameplay  the game has a steep learning curve which i enjoyed at first but then the errors of the game became a little more clear there were obvious hitbox issues when i played which of course people will say is due to skill and the shot registration just felt sub par for a game held on such a high pedestal gamemodes  the gamemodes are simplistic and easy to grasp onto it took me a round or two to understand the objective i have no complaints about the gamemodes price  yes i understand thast this game was just $15 but you can not defend a game just because you didnt pay full price that is like if somebody goes out to eat and they have a gift card and then all of the sudden the food isnt as good as they usually make it because he is paying less there is no justifiable reason verdict  i gave this game a chance i would say that 8 hours is plenty long enough to come up with an opinion i never go home and think to myself lets go play some counter strike if i do play it is because my friends pester me about it i can see where people can enjoy the game but it is just not the game for me

an intense storydriven game written by the community brought down by glaring flaws the plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs hack wars commence scams are carried out and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible as one of the many players of this war you must choose your allegiances properly will you simply be another casual and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance race sex etc will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment unfortunately your character is outnumbered and outgunned he must be a hyperactive drug addict as he can run around at speeds that would make a ferrari blush with nearinstant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life he can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill god rather than the other humans shooting back at him fortunately your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy of course a lot of times much higherskilled players posing as lowtier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies these people are called smurfs they function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking of course there are also hackers some are possible to beat others are not they have added advantages such as xray vision computerized aiming and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds have fun with that the soundtrack is poor as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack dlc which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7 this is a very shameful business practice and one has to wonder why ea gets fluff for this but not valve the graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original xbox and lifeless environments this is said to make the game competitively playable but everyone knows good video games like call of duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision the optimization is rather poor as well on my stateoftheart 2011 laptop loaded with an intel hd 3000 the finest in graphics card technology it gets a pitiful 25 fps in menus with performance usually worse ingame this leads to frustrating deaths as i see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face or i suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face in which they will usually taunt me with expletives this is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade my computer can run crysis the loot system in this game however has much potential the guns you can get nearly rival borderlands the presequel in originality design and neon colors however unlike borderlands the presequel the guns cost real money on either the outsidegame service steam community market or by opening cases which cost $249 per attempt and usually only yield commongrade loot this is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base gearbox clearly has it right as unlike valve they never release overpriced dlc for their borderlands series as valve have shown they cannot design games they should hand off halflife 3 to gearbox software instead overall this game is outdated treats customers like crap has little content unintiuitive gameplay a terrible community bad level design and more stay away and buy call of duty modern warfare 17 instead 69420

this game was the best tactical game i had ever played the community was good people were mature sportsmanship was very well presented but all of that changed when the skins came the community of counter strike that we knew and loved got shattered in an instant this community is turning into tf2 but instead of hats it is skins its a pathetic excuse from valve to build an economy to make more money off of virtual items really valve you are turning this game into tf2 and its a joke more immature underage children are playing this game now and i dont like and i am certain that i am not the only one who thinks this way first off the community now is a disgrace you could be playing with someone become really good friends with them and then they ask for one of your good skins to borrow bam skins stolen and your hard work has meant nothing it increases the scamming within this steam community second the competitive mode is great it is challenging and very teamwork based but all that can change with a steam sale hackers banned well then lets price counter strike global offensive to 350 oh boy that was a good idea right a steam sale on this game is not only hurting us but steam as well people also buy counter strike global offensive on a different account so that means if you are a low rank in competitive not only are you against a higher rank but you are also at a high chance to lose its a complete and utter disaster when it happens it needs to end thirdly cases are ridiculous you literally have a 001% chance to get a rare special item knife people waste so much money on cases when at the end of the day its a virtual item you could go out and buy a real knife for about 50 at highest while the highest in this game is about 600 the economy is terrible community is terrible skins are a joke and steam are probably laughing at you as you go out and waste money on cases fourthly and lastly is the hit detection this game has a pretty bad hit detection system valve could go out and buy 124 tick servers but nope they go out and be cheapskates and buy 64 tick servers which is god awful i mean valve come on you make millions of  and $ why cant you actually just think about your game instead of how much money you take a bath in this game is great once you get into it and if you find a decent server 124 tick it is pretty fun one other thing i forgot to mention is when you play competitive there is a cooldown if you leave kill a teammate kick too many players or even if your power cuts during a match you only have 3 minutes to return to the match abandon the match ok sir we give you a 7 day ban a ban ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours to 24 hours to finally 7 days it is a bit unfair the banning system it is automatic so it cannot be revoked please valve fix your game and your community before it wrecks itself 610 for gameplay 210 for skins 310 for community 010 for competitive cooldown

counterstrike the game that lives up to its name so simple yet so much fun it could be considered the game that began competitive firstperson shooters or at least to my knowledge it is and compared to the other counterstrike games i gotta say csgo was okay graphics are nice oldschool maps and the new item drop system is a nice addition but now the only reason i play it is because im playing it with a friend or i just want a drop that i could sell no matter how pathetic it would be or i just wanna waste time you would find it awesome at first but at some point it didnt give me something cs 16 gave me and still gives today  thrill i wont say its bad but then again your moneys probably wellspent on this game on sale or wellspent on something else

this game was one of the best out there i repeat was cant recommend this anymore due to the immature community which reports you for every lucky headshot and then you have the possibility of getting reviewed by some idiot overwatcher and when youre having the best timevac ban please steam stop discounting this product and stop caring only about your wallet youre giving hackers and smurfers more chances to ruin this fine masterpiece of coop gaming ps i know 99% of you wont give a st on my opinion but who cares about you gamers anyway

i put a lot of time into this game and i got pretty decent at it but it got to a point where victories were no longer satisfying and losses were usually the results of really salty teammates or smurfingscripting enemies i have over 300 hours and i paid $15 for the game so i no doubt got my moneys worth but half of it wasnt even enjoyable it really comes down to what kind of matches you get put in but i think youll find yourself getting annoyed with the game more than enjoying it past a certain point

i have been banned for quite some time not because i hack or do stupid things but my internet disconnected and guess what valve think internet can recover in 3minutes how fast is it to know what to do when your internet disconnect and whats wrong with it please answer valve do i purposely disconnect my own internet when im in a winning position how idiot i am to do that and you reward me with 7days ban again valve oh please valve dont you say it cant be undone because its the system etc etc bla bla bla you create system to be controlled correct or the system control you please take my review seriously i am sick of this ridiculous ban

nice graphics new maps weapons and models but developers should listen to the customers a bit more developers you are focused too much on things that are not important at all you should focus on changing the tick rate of the match making servers to 128 and improving vac a lot those two are what customers really want and you should focus on not stickers ui and hud changes or skins and stop messing around with the weapons

i try to make this as short as possible but there will still be some lines of text i bought this game near the date of the release my account is more than 11 years old i bought more than 250 games recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them i joined them it was a hell lot of fun but  i was banned a so called cooldown for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an antismurf feature after winning 2 matches you will get banned they call it cooldown but you will actually get banned naming a ban cooldown doesnt change the effect valve faq says to you this is no big deal you can play the other game modes like casual or against bots yeah that changes everything not the competitive mode is the only reason i started playing csgo again and so will many others you have to keep in mind you bought the game and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around but they do the exact opposite i will explain that later in this review i cant say the words here i want to cause that would remove this review instantly i am so frustrated seeing my friends play all night long knowing it is so much fun yes the gameplay is fantastic intense fun but why in world isnt there some kind of filter i probably spent several 1000 of euros on steam the only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game and guess what thats what smurfs actually do to summarize smurfs buy several copies legit people dont so multiple accounts give an advantage to smurfs compared to legit customers this logic must come from one real brainiac at valve and the best thing i just experienced even the draws count as a win so if you would play very close matches which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system and you always get draws you would get banned everyday for 21 hours thats because you need 10 wins to get ranked and only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system this can take like forever even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session this would take at least 10 days beeing a normal worker you cant even play everyday having a family or other rl responsibilities makes this a real torture you have to play a month here and there single sessions for 23 games than quittinggetting banned waiting at least one day your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do playing another 23 games and this until you reach 10 wins this is absolutely rediculous a real shame by the way contacting the valve support ends up in getting an automatic response saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system maybe valve invests more time in counting money these days

ive wasted a lot of time in this game i think i finally can say my own opinion first of all this game doesnt have an optimisation even though you have a very powerful computer it still will be lagging as  as its possible secondly vac anticheat doesnt work properly there are many cheaters and whats very important valve doesnt give a  in addition the rank system in this game is totally unfair you can be deranked for no reason also there can be some people who have very low rank but they still can play like the global elite players i dont mean about people who have the second account with low rank furthermore the real community of this game consists of the ing idiots who cannot play well and they can only complain for some  as well as annoying and pulling whole team down can be made by them unfortunately its really hard to find someone who can play well and without any doubt show the real meaning of teamplay by the way about those things like the skins or something like this that dont make any sense valve is trying to get some money in the different ways especially its associated to the ing crates and keys i completely dont recommend you to buy them youll actually lose money in conclusion this game definitely sucks and it can lead you to get a brain cancer whats really funny that i will never stop playing this  probably i am already addicted here is a small advice for valve valve you are supposed to do something useful for this game that can really improve it

as usual there isnt a promosing gameplay behind counter strike  global offensive they hid all the bugs hacks mechanical issues and conectivity problems behind and cheap  microtransaction system in which they brainwash you to think that the problem with matchmaking connection and overall gameplay is regular and normal if you were looking for a competitive experience where learning from your mistakes aids you you really havent found anything of the sort here from direct hits with visual blood splatter not registering to lag hacks this game has it all youre gameplay will be as miserable as modern warfare 3s spawning was on release pitiful and a bunch of drivel their matchmaking system is as broken as michael jacksons face is natural youre being matched with people with far more experience than you its like their playing against bots your gameplay not only will be completely counterintuitive if you are not a regular in the fps world but it will be shattered by the amount of regurgitation you call the community people with 5year veteran badges to hackers claiming they trickshotz plz omg ur bad noob pros modern warfare in a nutshell cons counter strike source not only has better content but the gameplay is far more superior  connectivity issues  constant hackers with almost no patches to fix the issue ing hell at least nexon publishes patches to rid the hackers for a week or so mechanical issues in this game are so dumbfoundingly common and ridiculous youd have a better chance of getting a headshot if you smashed your  on the keyboard  microtransactions do nothing but cover up the wrong the game is worth less than counter strike source on sale at its current state the community is rambunctiously annoying egotistical and flat out mentally challenged

tldr dont play unless you can stand the hoards of idiots if you dont like getting kicked from matches that are 2 rounds off finishing this game may not be for you the game itself is alright perhaps not as good as 16 or even source but its solid the problem lies within the community which is the gaming equivelent of ebola for every decent person you pass there are 200 small racist children ive never heard the n word used so much in my many thousands of hour gaming as csgo players constantly kick you for being simply not good at the game even if you arent doing badly the kick function in both competitive and casual is abused to high hell in the competitive side of the game if you have no team to play with you are out of luck because of the shear number of blockheads and racists who scream while playing the community is often compaired to that of leauge of legands but im going to say that it is in fact worse i know this may be hard for some of you to invision but if you play this game you will understand why if you do want to buy this game i would suggest ignoring valve servers entirly and just finding some nice community server to play on dont get me wrong here the game aint half bad but jfc the playerbase

you call this csgo well i call it csbad cmon valve you should rename this game to cs stopplaying it cuz its bad bad things about this game this game is total trash out of all the variety of unique weapons people only use m4a4m4a1s ak47 or awp in this game the shooting mechanics and recoil is too much and mostly hard for newbies on this useless game the sounds of this game is a copy from mw3 cod engine and the gun sounds are too wubby and trappy 4 me smgs should be called small marshmellow gun shooters the damage of smgs are worse than trying to knife someone the damage point blank up close on the chest takes 10000000 bullets while you only need lucky headshots on these small tf2 hitboxes you can get more kills with the lowest tier pistol than an smg the only smg that is decent is p90 you see noob spray that pee pee gun around and spam it to your death mp7 should have no recoil like cod mw3 and real life unrealistic game shotguns are worse its the 100% nerf on cod shotguns it seems like the bullets are freakin hasbro nerf darts made from nike sweatshops in china up close point blank with any shotgun  no kill dont bother about using lmg why is it called light machine guns when its more heavy than a oversize truck full of my diarrhea ak47 is more op compared to the m4a4 with damage and 1 hit headshots from any range to even shoot accurately you have to stand still and memorize the tarded spray pattern if you move 1 mm the bullets fly up to the sky then the scout sniper rifle is a joke its only a hitmarker unless its a headshot the silenced weapons do more damage and are more accurate i seriously dont get how big the recoils are for every weapon its like the counter terrorists are some scrawny 16 year olds and can barely hold the gun and the terrorists are some recruited isis 12 year olds with towels on their head dumb talibans im surprised the terrorists doesnt have an rpg wouldnt matter anyway since it would only do 01 damage the bullets must not do damage or just dissapear in thin air since most of the shots doesnt register saying you only did 10 damage with 1 bullet gg this is the only game where you need luck and aim for headshots while shooting else where is useless with the armor ohand if you get shot at you move 100000% slower which unrealistic unless its your legs being shot at espeically with all that armor people use hearing like its sitrep pro from cod mw3 which is annoying to preshoot you and crap knfing is useless other than running faster idk why the camos worth 100000000000000000000000 dollars same with any other weapons and their stranges who even uses the zeus the recoil is so horrid it needs to be mentioned again why have a crosshair when you spray you aim the crosshair where should be on the player on the ground so the bullets fly up in the air is now at your target i think these ct were trained in the army so that the recoil and aiming is stupid and the osama bin laden squad is just naturally bad at aiming stormtroopers can aim better than these useless guns with its mechanics jesus the only recoil spread i can master is the awp this game has no killstreaks such wow lame why have the rest of the other unique and well made maps when the only map people play is dust 2 demolition is a new game mode that is trash and similar to gun game from cod casual is what people only play deathmatch is the even worse version of tdm in cod the spawns are worse than mw2 rusti would spawn infront of someone or someone 2 feet away from me and get graped from behind arms race is just plain stupid just a copy of cod mw3 gun game hostage is very unique but only have to rescue one to win how bout the other 2 guys thats right next to each other to pick up plus the terrorists push more than the ct gg competitive is full of tryhard plebians and casual is full of smurfs if you leave a competitive match thats unfinished you get consquences by cant join another comp match for 30 min then 2 hours 24 hours then week or something you get temp banned basicallyi can understand if people ragequit but what if i have to take a dump for 10 hours or my mom nags me to get off or even a sharknado came and hit my house and i got no power this is dumb last time i check this game isnt league of legends a genius way for wasting your hard working mcdonald jobs money they added camos and stickers to guns the only good camos for the only good weapons in the game are like 100000000000 bucks worse than buying hats on tf2 stickers are a rip off you only have 1 time to apply it with a terrible pov inspecting it before you apply it you can scrape it which ruins the quality idk why that is a thing since you cant scrape it off and put it back on with a different spot on your gun just have a remove button instead >> or at least let you reapply stickers the community is terrible you get kicked if youre bad or if someone calls clutch or kick with a lot of ghosters in casual this game is worse than all the cods especially black ops 12 and ghosts no wonder this game costs less than the old counter strike games and still doesnt worth 15 bucks i am a major valve fan owning l4d12 tf2 hl series etcand this game just dissapoints me hidden path either ruined it or valve wanted to took a crap on us and want money so gabe can eat it thinking its celery and losing fat i play video games 247 and never go outside this game makes me want to go outside and burn like the casper the friendly ghost white skin i have from the sun as the vampire i am this game created alqueada and isis groups blame this game for 911 this game gave me cancerous aids along with everyone else who bought the game changes game needs shooting mechanics like cod no mentally ill retarded recoil cuz characters in game dont know how to adjust recoil smg and shotgun buffs ak47m4a4m4a1s nerfed add rpgs killstreaks how do i aim down sights and run good things about this game none

fact have played cs series since the first cannot recommend this game very broken  you can do anywhere from 11 to 200 damage when shooting someone with a shotgun no matter how well you aim and how close you are you will see blood pour out of your enemies to have the game tell you you did no damage and you will shoot someone in the head with an assault rifle and do 2 damage when they do 211 with the same rifle despite them having no armour or helmet and you do opinion the recoil pattern feature in this game is also silly as you literally have to aim downwards and draw a t shape while shooting to keep your shots on target yes the patterns are essentially fixed patterns with the crosshair rather than do your best to keep it focussed on them guns which are the same calibre and similar barrel lengths sometimes have longer barrels by far will do alot less damage and penetrate armour worse than more expensive ones doesnt make any sense this game is very broken and i suggest you just play css instead as it is alot more accurate and features 100 tick servers over competitive 64 tick competitive css is also more expensive by 5 bucks because maybe valve knows that csgo is a complete mess tldr csgo isnt a cs about skill it is a cs about rolling the dice everytime you shoot someone if you dont believe me then youtube a video of csgo hit detection i assure you youll be amazed at how bad it is edit turns out the game was originally going to be made for consoles but then valve decided to develop it more for pc instead  game is a console port too

meh game so lacking in depth that the only gameplay in it revolves around exagerated recoil if you are prepared to spend hours shooting each gun at a wall to learn the spray patterns which arent even random then this game is for you this is one of those games that you actually have to study seemingly insignificant factors in order to enjoy in other words you have to work hard to find the fun that there is to be had its one of those games that you only enjoy in hindsight if you have won but you likely will not enjoy the bore of each repetitive round the strategy revolves around being blinded either by a flash bang or smoke so even if you happen to spend the thousands of hours it takes to be consistent with the various weapons there is the issue that this is a team game that is more intensive than dota or lol if you are prepared to deal with casual players in matchmaking claiming that its just a game its ok to lose every time then this game is for you other players will likely ruin your competitive experience or you will ruin theirs then there is the issue of registry there are many hackers many smurfs and many exploiters in this quite popular bore of a game beyond that there are players that exploit their exorbenant ping to get an advantage over you when possible if you are prepared to be a loser because of 64 tick servers ddossers laggers smurfs hackers and terrible teammates then this game is for you then there is the fact that this is a winners game remember when you played winners version of basketball where if you make the shot you go again this game is kind of like that winners get paid losers dont so when you lose you lose hard so hard that you cannot afford weapons the next round and must thus lose again these are called eco rounds when you are saving your economy for the next round which is a gamble as well because if you lose that round you will have to eco again you can understand the stress involved with this game at a competitive level it makes competitive starcraft 2 almost seem trivial yet its game mechanics and depth of gameplay is utterly lacking and uninteresting the reward for having invested 90 minutes of aging stress into a video game where 75% of the time your upset is that you may win and experience temporary joy until the next game that you lose this cycle continues and you always chase the high of a game won no wonder so many players play this game its sort of like growing weed 9 months of growing 2 months of curing and you finally get to smoke it only in this game 5070% of the time your house gets raided by the cops and you have no weed to smoke after your extreme time investment leaving you extremely upset in short this game revolves around blindng players controlling recoil like a 3 year old girl you literally cannot hit what your crosshair is aiming at kind of misleading and you certainly cannot hit what is directly in front of you if you hold the trigger down that being said if your aim is terrible and you arent aimed at your target and you still spray you will likely get headshots and random kills because the bullets dont go where you aim anyways this is why young children like to play this game there is a thrill to be had when experiencing so much luck so if you plan on spending 10000 hours to become an average player at this game with an average rank and win loss ratio be my guest you cannot become great at this game without a great team and the thousands of hours fiddling with recoil with various guns at various distances on various maps against various players who use various techniques that being said with the time investment that it takes to actually enjoy this game and have fun you could likely have gotten laid by numerous women dont be a virgin for life trying to learn how to have fun at a silly game tldr look at my hours i got to dmg thats when i realized this game takes way too much trivial skill to be worth my time ill be playing games like insurgency starcraft 2 gta v and killing floor 2 out of the 600 hours i put into this game i likely enjoyed 10 or so i dont see what all the buzz is about

csgo is easily the worst counter strike game in the franchise which is generally what happens when you toss it off to a new team that has never worked on the game before good bye turtle rock studio hello crap one with some of the worst players in any game ive ever played csgo has the absolute worst toxic community players i have ever witnessed this includes games such as dota lol and any other toxic mobas something i never thought i could say playing competitive is almost unbearable for this reason alone sadly however there any many other reasons why this game is unplayable and serves no purpose in a sane individuals library of games another great reason is from the latest update which results in anyone whom has over 50 ping wanting to rip out their own hair as the hit reg will be so abysmal that there wont even be a reason to play or to even continue living at that point this leaves high ping players deep in the dark not everyone can have great ping especially when you are essentially forced to play on valve only servers which sometimes are super far from your location not to mention the hit reg is just bad as it is to begin with did i mention the recoil system is invisible your gun does not shoot up into the air bullets just magically come out in random directions to the point where if you need to spray you have to aim at the floor to shoot in the sky at this point im sure the devs know this game is awful lets not forget the fact that every comp match has at least 3 smerfs and probably a hacker as well the devs dont care though this game is a money pot which its highly addictive economy with tf2 like skin system makes all the kiddies explode woo moms wallet has never been so empty 12 year old power yeah ok have fun kids everyone goes mad bat  on this game im sure it will continue to do well for many years to come nothing will change the pro scene will keep going and players will keep being awful do your self a favour and dont join the aids network good luck and may god have mercy on your soul if you buy this game 610

csgo chicken seeker guaranteed offbase is a game where you seek your lost chickens so that you can return to your farm using different mechanics to scare your chickens and herd them to different points on the map point a and point b is the objective of the game youll find that its both fun and challenging to get your chickens there safely unfortunately the multiplayer aspect of this game is full of people who find it fun to disrupt your game its almost impossible to spawn into the game without getting griefed by your fellow players they will try their very best to kill both you and your chickens the game itself is unmoderated and this behavior seems to go unpunished the makers of the game seem to think this behavior is funny and have indulged the joke by coding the bots to grief in much the same way until this very serious problem is addressed i will have to give this a thumbs down only buy this game if you enjoy not being able to play your game due to a toxic community and incompetent developers who think such behavior is funny

classical game gone wrong thats my summary at least if you think the game is even at any point as good as 16 or css think again ill list some pros and cons pros  good looking skins remade maps easy to invite friends to a lobbyget a team farily quick modes like arms race gun game or deathmatch has been made official gamemodes cons  community is rotten way through into the core and back on the other side ranking system is completly broken spraypatterns take long time to learn and master especially ak47 cant select playable character in casualcompetetive gamemodesneither any other people tend to buy the game on a different account leveling up themself with that one so they meet people who are new with themselfs as very skilled players cheating when you see it youll understand changed spraypatterns smaller and somewhat broken hitboxes wallbanging is rare if valve took time and developed a good ranking system this game could have been amazing but no the game is about 6 euros on a steam sale people buy it smurf and destroy for all the other players you need about 5 wins in a row to rank up one rank every god damn time it doesnt matter if you beat nip or heaton himself you wont rank up without 5 wins in a row good luck with that when the matchmaking isnt working properly because someone wanted to rank up twice until valve fixes this problem together with the cheating this game is a big nono stick with 16 or source youll have trice the fun you have here

i really like counter strike and this entry is no exepcion everything is good now and it has a lot more room for expansion but please create an east server so the rest of europe can have more fun while playing for more than 20 game in streak i only listen to russian and since a medium percentage of them hates america they refuse to speak english and this is totally unsocial and breaks the communication in game ending up to a serious problem that leads the player into frustation and despair summing up in a deffeat this is the dark side of the community in the csgo scene and it can be easily resolved by creating a new server with this said im not being racist since im not that and i have friends in all over the world but it hurts the community to see the player personal beliefs and cultural influences get inside a game that is used to relief stress and to socialize a bit more with the world dramatic actions should be insued lord gabe just make it happen

i ignored this game for so long hoping it would get better but it hasnt it shockingly got even worse before i start lets get into the history of counter strike the original cs was a fun competitive game that still remains superior to its sequel cssource cssource was popular mainly because of the large amounts of custom maps that were flooded into the game but killed competitive cs and turned the game into a casual shooter then csgo came this game was made solely for micro transactions but to be honest any game made by valve will be from now on but the game has no major changes from cssource other than skins and cosmetics furthermore these weapon skins and cosmetics feel like something that fits more in tf2 bright pink guns and meme stickers make me want to vomit but hey if you want to spend $300 on a knife skin that you will never use or get a kill on be my guest another problem are the guns none of them are balanced in the game most famous one being the awp the 1 shot 1 kill weapon and last we have the matchmaking it is some of the worst matchmaking i have ever seen any game where it takes over 5min to get into a match fails and csgo has no excuse seeing as how as of this review it is the second most played game on steam and lastly the main reason i hate this game is the community so i was on a server everyone was dead it was me vs the entire other team and as you would guess i died then some squeaker yells over the mic what the fck you idiot and starts a vote kick on me that passed the other way around happened where i hid in a corner no one checked and shot the entire enemy team and won and i get you fcking hacker and get kicked this stuff is normal when you play this game because 75% of everyone playing it is some annoying kid with some kind of meme name on top of that this game is full of russians that like to yell a lot now you would think that when you play on a west coast server russians wouldnt join because bad ping but they do and then you would know russians wouldnt join on an east coast server because it is on the other side of the world and they would get the worst possible ping but they still do its almost as if they are only joining these games so they can yell at people and not play the game at all 30% of all the nearby servers at least where i live are idle servers and even then there arent that many servers to begin with and it confuses me because this game has pretty much the same amount of servers as tf2 even though there are a lot more people who play this at least to what steam says in their stats and lastly this game is full of cheaters and having a ranking system where you get better ranks depending on your kd ratio will always make more dumb kids want to cheat and having next to no defenses against kids cheating because you can almost never confirm if this kid is hacking or just lucky because you pretty much instantly die if you get shot in the head with any weapon this game it is best used just to idle for the chance of getting a drop you can sell for 30$ with that said im done i would like to remind anyone reading this that this is my opinion of the game and everyone has different opinions and yes ik my opinion is sht and im an underagedpleb that clearly knows nothing about video games no need to sprinkle your salt in the comments

there are several things valve should improve and they keep ignoring them for a long time thats why my review is more negative than it could be biggest problems are definitely  vac its poor anticheat  64 tick we cant play this game on those standarts  bad region selection for mm playing with russians all the time nothing personal  we want to see how much percent of players are in each skill group or atleast in top4 which is considered proffessional for sakes of motivation  optimalize the game for more cores especially for amd its not a complete list of the issues but those are really worth a quick solution because only thing valve is now doing is expeding stupid skins and operations which brings almost no new joy to the game valve milks this  hard d 510  keep improving cs is awesome game stop milking skins and give us more unforgetable moments with this game through fluent and fair gameplay based on the skill and not cheats and also you can pump little bit more money into majors

ever played one of those freetoplay shooters with cash shops behold now you can pay $15 for another cash shop shooter now dont get me wrong the cash shop in this game does not give players an advantage over each other thankfully what cheeses me is the fact that we have to pay additional money if we want to enjoy other aspects of our game i paid $15 for the game and now i need to pay extra for locked content thats like selling someone a 12 pack of condoms for 15 bucks only to tell the user that they can only use 4 of them they would have to pay extra for the rest of the condoms it makes no logical sense  this business practise is plaguing the industry and i cant believe the developers bought into it its very disappointing now about the game its nothing special really youve got your typical counterstrike with better graphics the interface is also improved which is a plus gameplay hasnt changed much which is understandable but its really nothing special its pretty much like every freetoplay shooter on the market nowadays youre better off playing a game like cross fire or ghost recon phantoms because it is very similar to those two no singleplayer just multiplayer with your default maps you need to pay if you want more maps honestly its not worth your money im not saying this out of spite this is sheer honesty here i thought i would get more bang for my buck but i was mistaken 510 for me this game is average

this game is filled with hackers  how do i know cuz im one of those hackers hack tools are surprisingly easy to obtain  heres the story  me and 3 of my buddies got  because of 2 consecutive games with a blatant hacker  so we decided to do the same thing we browsed google and finally found a working hack on oldschoolhack csgo < there we used the hackwallaimbotbunnyhop for like a month then finally i got banned  soon as i got banned my friends stopped using the hack and got away safely without any vac  this proves that valve is ing   after i complain pretending that im not a hacker valve said that it was a legit ban and if i still want to play csgo i must purchase the game on a new account  really so from this i can see that valve doesnt really want to fix the hack problem  what they want is that they want people to cheat so they can ban them and make them buy another csgo  its all about business really  but still this proves that valve doesnt give a  about the community

counterstrike global offensive source engine game the latest in counterstrike game series following counterstrike source new weapons physics graphics and so on well why dont i review it like i reviewed halflife because i dont like it i expected more from a 2013 game but i saw nothing new in csgo except for new weapons and sounds physics mechanics shaders  everything was taken from the other source games left 4 dead 2 for example i do not recommend this game for everyone who likes either both cs 16 and css or one of them this game will disappoint you after 15 minutes of playing  its just more casual easier to play you wont use new weapons you wont get impressed by graphics you wont get any pleasure because of campers all the way through so should you buy the game if youll delete it almost instantly i dont think so but for casual gamers this game is just what theyve been looking for lots of action easy shooting very comfortable spread and recoil gungame mode deathmatch and such kills matter deaths dont just like in call of duty i dont think id recommend it but its up to you to decide

the valve anticheat system vac because nobody likes playing with cheaters playing games should be fun in order to ensure the best possible online multiplayer experience valve developed a stateoftheart anticheat system that automatically detects and permanently bans any player using cheats or hacks on a vac secured server what this means to you as a player is that you dont have to worry about annoying cheaters getting an unfair advantage and disrupting your game the valve anticheat system is only enabled on servers with the secured shield logo and only valve has the ability to vac ban a user while server admins may choose to ban players from playing on their specific servers they do not have the ability to vac ban players the vac system is automated and contacting steam support to report cheaters isnt necessary valve has a zerotolerance policy for cheating and will not lift vac bans under any circumstances

yes garrys mod was a great game2 years ago now the community is at its end after youtubers made videos about this game the community poured with immature prebuscents they are running unnecessary servers modeled after what they want and not whats best for the server weve got tons of player models for admins only a bunch of poorly coded gunsm9k and just a lot of unneeded addons clogging up loading time admins are super biased and abuse often yet they still beg for donations after a week of the servers opening and this isnt coming from me raging from one server 95% of darkrp and 50% of ttt servers are just like this the facepunch forums are usually kids asking how to make darkrp jobs you may wonder why im still playing this im usually testing my addons in singleplayer if you are pondering to get this game its the worst time to do so this review probably wont affect your decision but please do keep this in mind

update if this was more than two years ago i would have totally recommended this game to everyone as if this game should come with all pcs unfortunately not anymore do you remember when spongebob and patrick went through the perfume department and nearly died well that is what garrys mod is like nowadays as you try and move into this new world and explore the opportunities placed out there for you you dont get sprayed with perfume like in the show you get ambushed by the worst community ever comprised of worst being first toddlers who are still learning how to speak who either scream or cry into dollar tree mics furries that are just utterly terrible fnaf autists who are autists bronies most of which take a game too seriously many others are down right annoying and anime nerds a group that is neither good nor bad as there are some mature people within the group where the good ones are meh but the bad ones are bad it is a rare occurance to find an actual nontard man woman age 16 who doesnt throw a fit over a game drop a ban hammer if questioned or has the ability to squeal so loud into a mic it breaks the sound barrier and sends the listeners off to the gates of hell to be annally massacred by the spirit of the autist himselfherself until a new pewdiepie vid comes on of him screaming into his monitor while he watches diners driveins and dives where then you are given the chance to crawl on all 4s out of there and back to your home browsing the workshop is also just like the perfume department every page is loaded with the exact same content for fnaf let me repeat that exact same fnaf content often there will be some animebronyfurry things but all together arent as oftenly seen as fnaf autist stuff let it be known if you can make it through all of that cancer there is a nice variety of content waiting for you you will mostly see all of this stuff jammed into multiplayer like cinema loaded with the bad anime nerds jailbreak loaded with autists in general or simon says as i would like to call it becauase you know nothing says jailbreak like simon says it doesnt even make sense but for some odd reason the kids who run these servers find it enjoyable to just play simon says for hours upon hours in a jail ment to be broken out of the rp servers are a joke you are hit with the same community and you should expect to be kicked or banned a lot quicker than usual and ttt which is loaded with coppies of the fat kid from sandlot who love to butter themselves up to the mods only few make it out in one piece that being me you think i always looked like this this is the face a person who survived the impossible and made it out with all most of his brain cells or atleast enough to type this all up do yourself a favor and only get this game if you want to just sit in sandbox mode with a friend or two and make stuff for fun but do not do what i did and go into multiplayer because you might not make it back out the same its funny it really is just to sit back and watch a bunch of kids yell incomprehensibly at eachother

oh garrys mod 13 why did you have to ruin everything gmod used to be a great sandbox game with a few bugs here and there but then that dreaded day where gmod 13 came out changed everything the game only went downhill by that point for some reason they decided that removing half of the props was a good idea those really cool and useful tools that you use all the time nah were just going to remove them for you got some pesky bugs in your single player map we dont care since gmod is played multiplayer more than singleplayer you used to be able to build pretty much everything imaginable with the old addons and possible extra addons that you could download from eg garrysmodorg but sadly that is now no longer possible obvioulsy you can still have lots of fun with all these new online gamemodes but singleplayer just aint what it used to be anymore

garrys mod just isnt cool anymore it was unique special but its steam simply ran out the most important reason is the now incredibly outdated source engine everyone who creates content like models and maps is moving onto new engines this could be neglected when source was 56 years old but now the very core on which the engine is based on is 10 years old and severely limited not to mention ugly thats relatively speaking of course furthermore the base content is also about 10 years old and i for one am sick and tired of it yet any attempt to use other content fails naturally because of large download sizes and horribly low percentages of people who own for instance episode 2 let alone left 4 dead finally gmod wasnt popular because of sandbox but because of other gamemodes the people who once made gamemodes for gmod because it was relatively easy to do so are now making standalone games for new engines like unreal and unity that make the process dead easy compared to engines about 5 years ago and are amassing huge communities too there were always many kids playing gmod but it is the old guard that simply moved on its only natural because gmods limits have been reached there can be new ideas sure but most avenues have already been explored and seen it was a nice ride and we still can hope for a couple of years of stagnation but in the end like all good but old games gmod will be played by about 100 or so loyal fans living in the past

i remember when gary made that first post that was the day gmod died he talked about a big change to gmod and said he wanted to try to convince us that its great so we should hear him out it has now killed the game garrys mod has now been reduced to cloud mods that must be reviewed and published on a site and you cannot mod another mod due to copyright there is no freedom gmod is now a game based on the game because the only available content is some meme or valve material meant to be laughed at because heh thats cute instead of actually doing great things garrys mod is the game where you point at cute things and smile it used to be the game where you do crazy  after the big switch only 10% of all mods in existence stayed compatible and now a whopping 25% of the previous mods were remade for the new version i lost all of my mods

garrys mod is a good game but theres a major drawback that almost make me regret the amount of hours ive put into it ill list this out in a proscons format pros good and friendly community  at times  lots of mods available on the workshop accessibility and support with mods is integrated into the game very easy to run a laptop from 2005 could run this game at low and manage to get 30 frames lots of variety in terms of game modes zombie survival trouble in terrorist town prop hunt etc open source anyone can create modsput them on the workshop con  the only con for this game and many others is the community the community has an influx of a younger demographic as a result of their favorite youtubers playing this game the children in this game are fine sometimes but usually they can be a nusianceannoyance this can be shown clearly in the comments on a populartrending mod in the workshop although they can be an annoyance it hardly hinders the fun of the game conclusion although garrys mod has its flaws its still a good game if you can tolerate the community on this game go ahead and buy it if youre like me however and cant tolerate a large amount of younger players in video games i would steer clear because of what i just previously said im personally not reccomending the game for anyone who shares the same opinion as me tldr too long didnt read garrys mod is good if you can tolerate massive amounts of children if not stay away from this game

with the recent development of skyrim introducing payed mods garry the maker of garrys mod is thinking of adding payed mods and i am heavily against it the idea will work good for those established commercial servers that get a great amount of donations to run but it will squash the little servers that small amounts of people play on allowing payed mods could ruin the game play of many servers included is the article about garry talking about payed mods httpgarrytv20150424payingformods

now half of you will just rate the review unhelpful because its negative but be reminded that every one of these problems is something i want to be fixed not that i laugh about read on if you care or be one of the many who would disregard what i say because they think its bad to point out issues and will blindly follow warframe to the depths of hell itself to shoot down critisizm look at my hours i know what im talking about offputting community with really shortsighted devs first the positives its free to play with some restrictions playing with friends can be a lot of fun the problem is trying to get them to play the game with you its harder than you might think combat is fun albeit a bit buggy at times weapons and frames a quite varied making almost every item a new experience not bad in terms of graphics everything looks like plastic and rubber but hey its a free game now the negatives the game is an infinite power creep the forums i have never met such a nasty group of people in my life the game doesnt have too much grinding the game is grinding you are grinding to grind more the game is ridiculously easy you can get almost every item in the game in just about a month the paywalls unless you only want to have two warframes you gotta pay up that or attempt the horrible trading system the generic enemies of clones and spacemen most of the concepts are quite unoriginal the enemy designs seem to be based on freaking shapes or just generic space zombies straight out of something like halo or dead space the ai barely makes enemies a threat they will suicide rush you solo all while getting slaughtered the bugs this is a beta game but good god its been out for 2 years they simply neglect to fix them hell sometimes they create more bugs than they fix these things are so rampant it actually makes a serious impact on the games sometimes from camera issues to getting stuck in walls bugs ruin so much of the gameplay that it hurts sometimes the balancing de couldnt balance a seesaw some items are worthless others op to the extreme the developers have proved time and time again to be completely incompetent when it comes to the issue of imbalance with weapons and frames they will leave the top teir weapons that completely outclass anything that comes near them alone while nerfing random items that very clearly didnt need it it makes no sense the whole update process is an endless stream of nerfing and ignoring they also just straight up ignore useless frames and items theres nothing more to say they just ignore them the updates most just introduce a shiny version of something already in game or a useless gun the end goal if you dont care about a number next to your name there is none the asskissing de will release a patch to fix something they broke and people thank the  out of them yeah sure that makes sense not to mention any critisism of any of their decisions no matter how stupid they are will be shot down by their white knights the gameplay stealth is a neglected factor entirely the whole game is just trying to get ahead of your squad to try and do more damage any other gamemode is just killing  with some minor objective to focus on while you spam your skills or choice of overpowered weapon the devs greed they will ignore major problems so that they can release a new prime package and find more ways to suck your money out like slots for example the idiotic community just go look at the wiki every pages comments has someone  on a weapon and telling you some other one is better they just bicker endlessly about everything the matchmaking there isnt any you have to go sit in a chat room unless you join a clan which you should be and wait for some rhino prime to join your game unless youre doing normal missions cause then you are  out of luck cause unless some random person is doing the same node at the same time youre doomed to play it solo the money creep of cosmetics every new item that comes out is more expensive than the last you know why de does this cause they know their braindead community will eat it the  up and throw tons of money at the screen while mashing thanks de into their keyboard as hard as they can the lack of progress with updates sure they come often but seriously they give us random weapons that whos gonna care about when there is elite top level gear that cannot be outclassed the updates never bring anything new or significant the lack of variety in gamemodes theres like 4 or 5 gamemodes and you better like them cause they are gonna be the only thing you play ever the pvp this should have never been added the conclave is straight up dead being horribly unbalanced and incredibly laggy ill get to the reason behind that next and dark sectors are controlled by clans that use ddos and other shady tactics to force massive taxes down players throats the lack of servers every game is hosted by a player which means lag a lot of lag it sometimes makes the game literally unplayable and its incredibly common the crashing i crash 23 times a day on warframe just my god if i had to list the amount of times i had to altf4 out of the game this review would be three times as long the movement you simply latch on to walls when you wall run nothing feels natural every jump every vault they all feel stilted and slow not to mention sometimes you just fly mach 5 across the map when you jump from a sliding position the jumps are so irregular the melee combat you run up to the enemy mash the e key and you might hit them its completely random and just like other weapons melee weapons are completely unbalanced for the most part heavy weapons are useless and certain weapons destroy the rest hands down its borderline  the argon issue every new weapon requires argon crystals as an artificial way to make them harder to obtain this simply comes from des issue of being uncreative with ways to acquire new weaponry the fact that certain frames are one trick ponies certain frames are only used for one sometimes two abilities while the rest of their entire arsenal is completely ignored the lack of a challenge this somewhat correspondes with the game being too easy with a certain frame and weapon anything can be completed by a braindead child people actually have to make up their own endgame of getting to high waves simply to have the risk of being defeated the lack of a skill requirement as i said directly above so long as you have the right weapon and frame you can conqeur literally anything there is no reward for being good at the game in fact you dont even have to try your best simply having the numbers 1234 on your keyboard is enough to be just as good as anyone else the most ignorant developers ive ever seen here is an example there is a weapon called the dark dagger it is awful as every single handed dagger is however the hilarity insues when you realise that the tiny dark dagger is around the same speed as the giant two handed hammer fragor and you think thats bad none of the dagger stances actually match the dark daggers stance polarity none that is the most idiotic thing ive ever heard in my life to be honest if you want to play with other people join a clan most of the community is elitism  who dont care about the gameplay and are simply waiting for the next prime to come out the more people who dislike this only proves what im talking about with the asskissing every one of these points is true no matter how much people will try to deny them fanboys will be ignored and most likely have their rant deleted think before you post

i started writing a review for why after a year of playing the game i changed my review for it from recommended to not recommended and it ended up being far longer than is a reasonable length for a review it is not the proper forum for me to write four pages as to what happened to the game and why i cant suggest playing it anymore if you want to read more on it i suggest going to the actual forums for the game not through steam but through the official website the players there are very active in posting and there will be a lot of threads going in detail about the faults of the game and talking about how des actions have never been further out of sync from what players want from the game and from the direction they were once taking it instead of writing four pages ill summarize it into something short and concise again if you want more specifics feel free to go look into them but ill summarize as i have logged more than enough hours into the game to be very familiar with it and what has happened what it really boils down to is this the company is using grind walls and severely crowded rng tables to deliver content which is one of the least creative and worst examples of game design i have ever played it wasnt originally going to be that way but that is what it has become now and considering it is supposed to be an action game and not an mmorpg the grind really kills the feel of the game you are much less of a space ninja saving the solar system and more of a mindless drone collecting resources for new weapons all for literally no reason at all due to the lack of story in my 20 years of gaming experience i have never seen a company so unwilling to work with what their player base wanted and just outright ignore them the community is incredibly vocal with ways to make the game more enjoyable for the players and keep them interested and avoid just getting burned out on the game and patch after patch they go ignored from the past year of expereince with this game the current state is that it is a fantastic concept being delivered in one of the worst ways imaginable by an inadequate design and balance team

so ive been playing warframe for around 2 years now and i have to say ive had fun it wouldnt be fair to review this game with a negative bias like the one i have so im presenting facts as objectively as i can here in as fair of an environment as i can warframe is a scifi thirdperson action game that plays more like a firstperson shooter on steroids it essentially feels like a crossover between older fast paced games like quake and unreal tournament with properties akin to that of a more modern shooter that being said i cant call into question the fun other people have playing this game so i cant consider that a worthwhile approach to determining whether or not the game is worth paying any money into or not but i can say its fair to judge other factors for example this game is based heavily around modding the use of items to upgrade weapons appropriately and crafting the use of materials picked up from fallen enemies  broken containers or enemy storage lockers to build things like weapons and characters to use it takes a very long time to gather these materials and because of this it has been referred to as farming when a player repeatedly runs the same mission or runs a mission for a very long time in order to gain more of a material out of it now heres where my reasoning comes in as to why i dont like this game as much as i could it takes too long i am someone who has a lot more free time on my hands than the average gamer so i havent had to buy much in this game using the ingame currency platinum  which is purchased with real world money  now thats fine having microtransactions to skip the time consuming part of a game is okay because you can still have the option of acquiring it yourself over a longer period of time with simple hard work whats not okay is something warframe players refer to as rngesus the random number generator whats also not okay is the extensive nature of farming a significant portion of content in this game is hidden behind a grindwall or rather an extensive task or list of tasks that must be performed before you can access certain parts of the game this is not as bad as dlc and it isnt as bad as microtransactions in some other games but it can be fairly irksome at times all in all this game is fair about how it treats many things especially how it treats microtransactions  in the fact that a huge number of things can very easily be acquired with time and effort  except for one problem pricing it effectively costs around $10 to get a typical weapon and $15 or so for some of the more expensive ones this is a problem that is very hard to argue against or in favour of because of an even larger problem the value of time calling into question the fairness of the pricing of microtransactions in this game is difficult because you call into question the value a player has of their time is it worth spending $10 to get a weapon now or is it worth spending a day to collect the credits and resources to buy it then wait an additional 12 hours for it to craft is it worth spending $15 to get a warframe  playable character  immediately plus bonuses or is it worth it to spend several hours acquiring the parts and the credits and resources then waiting approximately 45 days on average for it to build the problem here in my eyes is that it is not worth it typically because in the time it takes to acquire these things i could have done much more in other games or even worse for $15 i couldve bought an entire other game now we move on from pricing and platinum  microtransaction issues to another thing that irks me balancing i admit that warframe is technically still in beta and that many things still do need to be complete but this does not feel like a beta game any longer there is a huge quantity of content in this game which i would easily value as being worth well over $40  generous for a game that has no form of very specific story or singleplayer campaign  no straight up form of sandbox as well as being restricted to missions that are run from your liset which is essentially your main menu of sorts  the audio quality is impressive and the visuals are even moreso the animations for melee weapons are both practical for gameplay and impressive to actually look at though the game begins to disappoint when it comes to the secondaries and primaries which all share one unified means of holding primaries and holding secondaries where you hold all primaries as a rifle and you hold all secondaries as a pistol there are unified reloading animations for some weapons although thankfully it also seems many weapons have their own unique reloading animations and firing animations in some cases bow weapons all share the same animations and no one single bow weapon has its own animations unfortunately thus far countless assets are recycled in this game although this has no significant effect on gameplay so i wont consider that something to tally against recycled assets in this case being many enemies who share the same model with different colours for example an enemy known as the nullifier makes abilities useless  abilities in this game are essentially akin to spellcasting from other games where you can throw fireballs set up shields etc many things really  i personally dislike nullifiers simply because they detract from an environment where the use of abilities is one of the main things that makes the game stand out from similar shooter games many enemies in this game rely on actions that knock you down  rendering you unable to fight back by any means  using attacks that in some cases are completely unavoidable thankfully unavoidable knockdowns are rare although the true problem is not the knockdown itself but the fact that knockdowns have no counterplay  once youre on the ground youre unable to do anything to make your character get up faster  unable to defend yourself even if only rolling out of the way of incoming fire  this game has plenty of cover but no cover system to make greater use of it thereby unfortunately making no use of an otherwise potentially unique addition to an otherwise straightforward gameplay system the enemies are fairly intelligent and make use of cover to the point of it even being annoying in strange ways at times for example enemies will frequently change course repeatedly  running back and forth or even running in circles  because they are trying to move towards two different sources of cover simultaneously ai bugs aside the ai is intelligent and fun to fight against there are countless weapons to use but another unfortunate thing is that with how the game treats enemy scaling the most useful weapon always ends up being the one that cranks out the most damage generally speaking you will always perform better with a weapon that does much more damage than another weapon that operates in a more unique fashion  for example the flamethrower weapon does so little damage and has so little effect on enemies that its generally just a better idea to use a heavy machine gun or rifle that does vastly superior damage overall  artificial difficulty is a topic commonly talked about in warframe with the most common subjects being the repeated nerfs and buffs being done to characters who typically arent deserving of the treatment they get another topic tends to be the way in which difficulty is improved or upped as the game gets into higher levels with enemies becoming textbook bullet sponge enemies and increasingly cheap tactics such as unnecessarily frequent knockdowns or locking the players movement and so on all in all i cant really recommend this game to people who either lack free time or are at all prone to being frustrated by what can be described as an unfairly balanced environment

pros  there seem to be lots of updates rolling out things like guilds space stations for your guilds etc  and as a result the game is already much better than it was in march  for a free to play game warframe has top of the line graphics and controls  a huge variety of warframes mods and weapons results in a lot of customization potential  running around as a space ninja is obviously gonna be a recipe for a good time cons  the game is basically a grindfest to find materials with which to construct items and at this stage the gameplay definitely gets repetitive fast  not only does the gameplay get repetitive but the locations strongly remind me of early halos copy paste level design  the story has been worked on since the beta started but its still pretty threadbare andor incomprehensible  as every mission is an instanced encounter its sometimes very difficult to find other people to group with on the lower level planets  even when you do manage to find a group there is almost no communication teamwork or strategy instead everyone is just essentially racing one another through the level to get to the loot furthermore the game even aids this mentality by providing an exclamation mark on your minimap directing you through whichever mission you are in helping you maintain top speed at all times verdict my first instinct was to add another piece of slag to the stuff listed above that i feel this game is a little too far towards paytowin on the freemium scale my reasoning for this is that it just takes so much time to get new warframes and armor without caving and paying real money i played warframe for around 22 hours and i only managed to build one new sword and one item enhancer in my opinion thats a really poor rate of return add to this that the packs you can buy with real money are 40 bucks or more on steam i got mine for $10 during the summer sale and its easy to see that the game is designed to siphon away either your money or your time the thing is this is maybe the only kind of situation where im not enraged at what i would normally decry as pay2win  this system works because the game is almost entirely pve and you arent really competing against anyone due to this important distinction i feel like the player cant really resent it when others pay real money for fatter lewts because the only time you see them is when youre helping one another kill stuff though it waxes too far into a grindfest for my tastes warframe is a decent freetoplay with nice graphics and uncomplicated controls see other game reviews and articles at gamesmeltercom

speaking as a player from the steam release in 2013 wasted potential the game horrible weapon and frame balancing devs seem to outright refuse to fix fundemental issues with the game and are just content with piling more shiny things onto the garbage heap endgame can be hit within the first 510 hours of play its just grind and scamming other players in tradechat game is incapable of being difficult without also being tedious at the same time meat sponges instagibcapable foes forcing gear limitations stat restrictions etc in part due to the satisfying but ultimately imbalanced movement system and fundementally broken mod system mod system relegates player progression to the mercy of rngs whims mod drop tables are oversaturated with useless things like 75% radiation resistance that absolutely nobody runs if anybody tells you that they run those mods theyre simply horrible players or their mod count is lower than the number of combined digits across their fingers and toes stances advertised as a longawaited fix to the horrible melee system were a disappointment and also relegated to the drop tables futher saturating them no variety in builds if you want to grind efficiently stack damage mods on guns slip in crit mods if the base chance is 20% or more put every power mod that would be suitable on your frame then fill the rest with durability mods melee has been awful forever and only serves as a mobility tool enemies are either inconsequential glass figures or spicy meatsponges due to the messed up scaling bought upon by the mod system dont ever buy platinum paid currency unless you get a 50% off coupon or better as a daily login reward its horrible value for money otherwise for the love of god do not buy the starter packs on steam at their base price they are a huge ripoff only reason i bought the tenno pack last year is because it was like 75% off during winter sales and became excellent valueformoney weapons and warframes in the market are hideously overpriced considering youll need to go through tens of weapons and warframes to rankup pvp is an absolute joke you know how in most rpgs you deal a lot of damage compared to enemies but also have a lot less hp compared to them its like turning party members in those games against eachother you just run about instagibbinggetting instagibbed and finding ways to cheese the system enemy variety is poor with the only real distinctions being the differences between heavy troops and regular ones the former of which is the only thing you should really consider when modding weapons as theyre far far more resilient than regular enemies theres no pay2win only pay2notgrind warframe utilizes a timebased gating system like those commonly found in mobile games you kill enemies in missions theyll drop materials youll buy the blueprint from the marketplace and then youll craft the item weapons take a minimum of 12 hours to craft clantech takes 24 hours plus the time spent crafting the prerequiste materal this can make the cumulative time of some clantech to be over 96 hours if youre deadon with your timing in moving through each stage although there are many missions available which offer those special materials as rewards massively reducing the total clantech crafting time warframes take a minimum of 84 hours to craft get the helmet system and chassis blueprints as random boss drops they take 12 hours each but can be crafted simeltaneously then combine them into the main warframe blueprint from the market which takes 72 hours to craft to be honest i dont have an issue with the timegating system as it isnt coupled with pay2win stuff like most timegate systems are although some might which is why ive explained it here the good things about the game it looks very nice although the atmosphere is nonexistent as opposed to how it was years ago go search for early2013late2012 footge and compare it with 2014 footage movement system is fun but is almost impossible to balance around without introducing tedium gunplay is okay i guess devs dont do rollbacks whenever exploits pop up and are fixed if youre fast you can capitalize only real reason im still onandoff with this game is plainly put some form of addiciton although i did quit coldturkey for about 8 months earlier this year out of plain disgust with their implementation of the stances system at the time of writing this it seems im phasing out again whether or not ill come back i dont know although im looking at this from the perspective of a longtime player so if youre new then you probably havent become disillusioned with the game quite yet and will enjoy the bit that you play its like a worse version of mass effect 3s multiplayer also warbros 1

its an interesting twist on third person shoot man games that leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to accessiblity versus a grind its free to play so obviously youre gonna run into roadblocks but eventually youll be wondering why youre running through the same levels blasting the same enemies for the same if not less rewards if youre a sucker for aesthetics though then itll suck good twenty hours outta your life with the player character designs and weapon variations give it a spin but dont bother dropping money on it unless you really really wanna be a space ninja

interesting but very grindy and samey artificially difficult you need to have grinded enough to not be dead weight to your team the weapons are horribly imbalanced even with the new damage system and while youre supposed to be stealthy ninjas the best way through a level is to gun everything down with the heaviest weaponry or ignore enemies and alarms entirely the developers seem to almost genuinely care about the community but some of their ideas are halfbaked and their quality assurance team appears to be nonexistent ultimately a casual runandgun with severe balance issues that still manages to be one of the better f2p games on the market

this game has nice graphics and the gameplay is fun however theres a reason why this is still in beta after playing for a week or two youll see that pretty much all the missions are quite similar sure there are different ones like extermination and survival but most of them end in getting the task done and then running back to extraction also this game is a complete grindfest the devs put up ridiculous prices so you either have to buy the item or you have to grind for days in order to get it however if you do get your item it usually takes days for it to be ready a new warframe takes three days three and you need three components which all take a day each to build in order for you to move on to the main blueprint takes 3 days to build so this game emphasizes on you either having money or time but yeah not much content or backstory either i seems interesting enough but its so vague i would just play this for a week and then get on with your life

this game started out fun enough especially for a free to play game unfortunately every patch and theres about 4week makes the game even worse its been out for almost a year and i dont think a single bug has ever been addressed while every patch brings a whole host of new bugs most minor some major the netcode is terrible there are no dedicated servers instead relying on one of the four players to host it seeks out the absolute worst host imagineable for every game when i play with friends its fine but about 910 times you play with the public the lag is so bad as to render the game as unplayable the game frequently refuses to accept certain inputs its fairly common to just be plain unable to use your melee weapon or be unable to crouch for several games bosses occasionally become completely invincible did i mention the lag its bad i dont just mean theres lots of snap back and targets become impossible to hit im talking extended intervals ie doubledigit minutes where its so bad you have trouble leaving the room youre currently in the variety of weapons started out as neat unfortunately theyve increased the grind factor needed to get them every day this is the rare case of a an early beta game being pretty fantastic but absolutely every change theyve made since then has been for the worse i would pay money for the warframe of 8 months ago i wouldnt pay $001 for the warframe of today

so warframe a game where youre a space ninja fighting off stupid robot things while grinding like  to get upgrades and better weapons although the game can be fun at times it can get really repetitive really fast a lot of the missions are rehashes of other missions with minor changes to the layout or enemy placement and speaking of enemies the ai is not good in this game stealthing is very easy as the range of vision isnt far and they dont detect sound making it almost too easy also they dont seem to dodge too much and will only move side to side when getting shot at making them a little easy to hit the grinding is just hell you will spend hours upon hours just to unlock a new weapon or certain upgrades although this may seem fine at first glance it will get tedious as time goes on if youre into that then good for you but i for one am not the controls are a small complaint for me as they feel awkward and sometimes unresponsive at times some controls feel awkwardly placed and some take a lot of time to get used to some will argue that its a free game and that a lot of this stuff doesnt matter sure you think that but for me it just isnt a game that i took enjoyment in playing recent updates have added interesting things but not enough to keep me playing its an average game that has a lot of wasted potential and falls short with heavy grindfests at times awkward controls and heavy repetitiveness this game gets a 610 from me you may disagree and think this games really good and thats great you enjoy but i found no such enjoyment

pros nice graphics great variety of warframes and weapons and its free cons ninjas play free  more like mindless drones collecting resources so they can make better gear to collect more resources with play free even though the game is free to play there is only very little you cant buy with real money as in you can either spend 34 days depending on how much do you play farming for resources to get a new warframe character class and then spend another 23 days building it or you can just buy it for 20 dollars the game does everything in its power to make you throw money at it  want a pet you can either farm for an egg which can drop from dens present only on one planet usually found in quantities of 4 per mission then you have to farm for credits and resource obtainable only in special area accessible only with a key received from several missions as a random reward then you have to craft an item to even begin the breeding and then you have to wait 4 days before your pet matures or you can throw money at the game to bypass all this  but thats not all if you happen to not play the game for a while your pet will die because you have to feed it with item that costs quite a lot of credits there was also a new resource introduced some time ago which drops only from one enemy in the game that also happens to attempt suicide whenever he sees you to make you even angrier and drop money to bypass boring grind cash shop is incredibly overpriced  40 dollars for a discounted pack with three weapons out of which only one is good and a color palette weapons in that pack also have extremely small chance of dropping from a single enemy in the game who happens to be someone who can and more often than not will kill you before you even notice coincidence maybe those color palettes cost about 4 dollars each and there is about 10 in the store the game is focused on grinding and farming  if you want to play high level content you have to level up some gear and farm credits and resources to get your mastery rank up so you can then start farming resources for the good gun viable in high level missions so you can grind and farm even more to get even better weapons so you can grind all the mods and credits faster so you can repeat the whole process more effectively game is intentionally gear based  literally no amount of skill can help you if you dont have good gearmods bosses are just bullet sponges with the weakspot mechanic drop tables are diluted especially when new gear comes out games are hosted on players computers so expect heavy lag and common disconnects tldr if you enjoy doing the same boring and tedious thing over and over and over again this game is probably for you on the other hand if you dont like being ripped off by greedy developer you should look somewhere else

ninjas pay fees would be more appropriate lets be serious for a moment yes this game is no pvp oriented and yes you can get almost everything by grinding but this game is not only lacking any direction and making its developers look like the lovechild of ea bioware and ign the whole thing is made for you to feel frustrated enough to buy some stuff the moment you jump into it you will feel like there is almost no way to progress naturally you are stuck with a very underpowered loadout in the first three planets for a while you may think you are getting some nice loot until you realize you are not able to craft anything useful until later in the game when you can access the harder missions and once you complete the star map you will find little to no reason to play unless you want to get new stuff to painfully level up every single time you want to fully customize it not to mention the huge prices in the cash shop if you happen to consider skipping some of the content in this game that is grind to grind please let me make this clear once a game has monetization cash shop or the like is no longer beta it is just an incomplete released product using a buzzword to avoid criticism if you seriously want to play this game just be warned  you will have to grind for days or play with matchmaking which is almost a never newbiefriendly experience  you will need to be in a clan asap if you want some of the better gear to tackle the challenging content later in the game  you will be tempted from every front to spend real money in the game either by the poorly implemented trade system or the painful grind  if you happen to have some complaints you may find half of its community to be really hostile and blindly loyal also you will experience game breaking bugs in every major update while this is kind of expected the loyalists will dismiss all your complaints as gamer entitlement and thus slow down the process thanks to how developers take negative feedback into account in short a nice artistic concept completely botched by pure greed and lazyness

its an awesome concept but the game gets stale after the first 3040 hours of gameplay you find yourself collecting the same things in the same levels against the same 3 basic enemy types the only thing that changes as you level up is the variety of weaponry available and the number of enemies onscreen imagine me3s coop multiplayer mode turned into a giant standalone minus the variety thats warframe

warframe was a good game back in the day although the gameplay in general is solid and fun the payment model and new trading system have completely destroyed what little economy the game had with the addition of prime access those of us who dont have $250 to throw at a pack are stuck farming endlessly with no chance ever to recieve the exclusives that are in the highcost packs i have many hours in this game with 1500 before it was even on steam if you have money to throw and you dont mind being forcefully excluded from exclusive items because you cant afford it by all means try it out be warned though the trading system has created a severally unbalanced paytowin blackmarket among players

saying this game is free to play is a bold lie let me tell you the story of when i started this game you are only allowed to pick 1 of 3 starting classes or warframes out of the existing 10 or 15 so you play around and you want to make a weapon you can either 1 use ingame points to unlock a blueprint for the weapon if the weapon you want even has a blueprint farm the resources to make the weapon which can take a really really long time especially for a starting player after obtaining everything spend even more ingame credits to start the making of the weapon which takes 24 hours not joking wait an entire day and then you get to play with the weapon or 2 give warframe your money making warframes is even worse you have to fight the same boss over and over just hoping you get the right drops from it you need a chassis blueprint systems blueprint helmet blueprint and a warframe blueprint you need to build all those items before you can even begin making the warframe which all use ingame credits and takes 3 days to make or you can throw your money at warframe oh and you can only have 2 warframes out of the 15 to play with you only have 2 warframe slots and like 5 weapon slots you want more weapons or warframes looks like you have to spend some more money you need to give warframe more money so you can get more slots just to get more warframes and weapons lets talk gameplay the gameplay is fun sort of i enjoyed playing solo missions more than playing with 3 other strangers  why because if i play solo i can try using stealth which is impossible if your new teammates fly down the halls shooting everything in sight also if i play solo i can play at my own pace every single game that you play online with 4 people the game becomes less of a fps and more of a race actually thats a perfect description of what happens it becomes less of theres 2 guys over there ill sneak up on one and shoot the other in the head and more of run run run oh look an enemy oh hes dead run faster faster it turns into a clusterfk of color ill summarize all of this so basically this is microtransaction the game the only way to enjoy the game to its full extend is spending a lot of money and i mean a lot i would actually prefer it if you had to buy the game that way warframe wouldnt be a lie and you wouldnt have to deal with half the bullcrap in the game sadly even if they did that you would have to deal with the other half of the bullcrap like waiting 3 days to play with a warframe its just a stupid system and is just used to siphon more money from your wallet oh i forgot to mention you can spend real money to speed up the process _ so yea more ways of spending money great the game is fun ish if you can look passed all the crap which i cannot if you ignore the facts that you need to spend money to use more than 2 warframes spend money to use more than 5 weapons wait 3 days to use a new warframe wait 24 hours to use a new weapon how the game puts micro transaction after micro transaction in front of your face every single time you open the game oh if you stop playing for a day the next time you open the game you win a random reward which is always a discount on your next micro transaction then you might like this game i dont

tldr if you love rng or spending real money on ingame swag then youve come to the right placeif not then gtfo and never look back gameplaywise warframe is actually a great game but the really messed up rng ruins the hard work that the gameplay has done its so random in fact that ive encountered several scenarios wherein energy orbs are either a dime a dozen or harder to find than waldo in a carmen sandiego book now apply this to loot enemies currency and crafting materials that being said it isnt lost to me that the developers did this intentionally just so that it would be easier to entice players to use actual money to buy the ingame currency platinum or the other pay to win options available buy warframes weapons boosts and materials as opposed to farming them got a lot of money to bypass the crappy rng play this game got a lot of time to waste on the crappy rng play this game no money or time gtfo and avoid this like the plague edit if you want to play this game but also want to reduce the wild rngs relevance then i suggest that you keep logging in till you get the 75% discount to platinum then buy the 4300 platinum pack from the store for 50usd that much platinum is more than enough to get you started and then some and the value is great

okay so i am and was a fan of this game i sponsored it before the present day i have bought things in microtransactions as well supporting the games development that being said i am really tired of the game it is a paytowin fest despite what people will tell you while you play the game you can supposedly make all of the equipment in the game but the people that do devote their entire lives to the game essentially so yeah its that type of game like diablo 3 or wow or world of tanks or something anyways the game has enjoyable graphics and play style but at the end of the day it takes alot of effort to convince yourself that its worth it to be this competitive for a player vs enemy game but it is just not theres no excuse for the play to win finances of the game other developers like that of path of exile dont go that route for example the game also has absolutely wretched connectivity issues not only do you have to up your ports for the game but even after that point you will disconnect lose connection to host your friendsguildmates wont be able to stay connected or the engine tasks you to play alone i have been in hundreds of 4 player squads and we encountered an area where one of us couldnt stay connected in the game and it wasnt even predictable it would affect one of us then another the developers are also working their keisters off to bring the players more guns and warframes characters and stuff of that nature but do not fix the issues with the connection game mechanics glitches and etc they also nerf items that the previous dayweek you spend real mulah on essentially ripping off the players they depend on funding their development before their very eyes and alot of them put up with it which is sad a game is not supposed to be this unfun so i cant recommend it at this point

i want to like this game but cant the basic shooterfighting mechanics are great the artwork is great the level design is mostly great the random nature of the levels is great but the new player experience is terrible the ui and map provide terrible guidance about what to do or where to go especially after completing the main goals for the mission you finish the main goals and then spend an hour fruitlessly trying to figure out where the mission exit is with zero help from the map or ui i had to quit and retry the 2nd and 3rd mercury missions to get a different map entirely before being able to complete the 2nd mission i gave up on this game after wandering around fruitlessly in the 3rd mission after completing the mission goal a solid hour back and forth through the entire level vainly seeking the exit with zero map indicators this game is promising but the new player guidanceexperience is awful

great graphics and smooth gameplay did not like the method of grinding to upgrade gear or to craft new warframes when you initially sign up you have a choice but did not know that you are stuck with said choice found some groups to play in mostly just rush right to the end of the level as quickly as possible pulling mobs with them and making the ending a lot harder to survive as a new player playing in the starting zone of mars found myself in random pairings of groups where higher level and more advanced players were farming accused me of riding their coattails wellthere goes the community i think with some polishing on the grind and lowering of cost in the store this game would be better its an mmo so you are bound to run into an ahole every once in a while but my luck was nearly every time i did not play solo

i wanted to like this but couldnt the biggest thing that jumps out at you is that this isnt a game that has grind its a game that was built around grind as a primary design mechanic and overall purpose in the game i dont mean diablo or borderlands type grind but incredibly dull mindless painful grind where often the best option is very low level missions you can just tear apart with ease or to just leech away in public games while it has a number of nice concepts it unfortunately fails to execute them very well worst among those being the painfully grind centric and rng related progression mechanic rather limited variety of loot that feels more like resource gathering than loot collecting and the overall poor game balance although this is shaping up to be one of those infinite beta type games with a functioning cash shop as theres always various aspects marked as coming soon currently being redesigned or reredesigned with some of the changes forcing you to wonder if much thought went into them at all while others are seemingly focused on just looking cool rather than if it would be an enjoyable game mechanic the space ninjas thing is a marketing gimmick as stealth in the game is not a good option and only semifunctional in one of the mission types although if you play with others they always just charge in with guns blazing like space marines mob ai is inept they like to run in circles then often take cover while standing behind explosive barrels things that only cover their lower half or just right out in the open the parkour only sort of works some of the time the rest of the time it either doesnt trigger or slingshots you off at mach 10 warframe certainly has its fair share of bugs in general i have all too often had to abort a mission giving up all my item rewards because the door to the next area wouldnt open the last mob was stuck underground the next sequence didnt trigger or so on it might shape up to be a really good game at some point along the line should it ever get out of beta and they really sit down to figure out how to get everything to work together effectively although as it is right now i couldnt recommend this to anyone

a convoluted unconstructed messy review which i also kept updating from time to time whenever i felt to do so whether its due typofixes or there are some other things worth mentioning i mainly if not only used to play this game from time to as a warning for those who are planning to even make a slightest financial or any sort of investment into this game i was indeed one of the fools who funded this game early on and can only continue due a specific group of people who make this game actually playable or otherwise functional thank you very much for helping you know who you are   a summary warframe is a videogame in which immersion is the higher importance to everyone than the actual functionality arbitrary metaphoric summaryaddition its a game build on very good foundation soon right before steamrelease they they blew a small rockhill very close to the house which gave some major fractures  cracks to foundation the game still kept standing though even if the floor and walls got quite tilted despite the advices of the experts instead of adding reinforces for the foundation or even drastically rebuilding the whole game the foundations only were plastered with new paint from the inside as the time goes on and the house is being filled with more items and tenants the cracks are getting more and more wide there are already huge waterdamages and everything else related at the basement and its only getting worse main review the game is decent modernishthrowback to times of mainly phantasy star online and such collectathons generally refencing to any game in which you might genuiely want to collect everything because its actually fun without feeling like a forefullyrepeatedchore but this is very heavily dependable to ones style of playing the games too also theres a very unreal tournamentlike feeling  vibe with various guns sans gameplayutility interfaces and various other features being quite playerunfriendly more related text written at the bottom of this review but here is  are the main issues only guaranteed way of avoiding the extremely amplified no lootissues when no playerfault is evident is to simply not play this game at all that is simply the most important game and dealbreaking issue that digital extremes proudly  boastingly  bad kind of audacitly on purpose implemented into this game very early on  few weeks before the steamrelease especially when no one with actually better ideas had asked for one if they eventually fix this then i might recomment playing this game this game is simply that huge of a healthhazard generally speaking otherwise there are far better dungeon crawlinggames on market some with much better multiplayermodeimplementations too   random afterthoughtsnote its actually quite funny that originally this game started as a offlinesingleplayerproject read dark sector damned you will be if youre trying to experience this game as a soloplayer eg lateron especially on obvious multiplayergamemodes such as defence but then you also have obvious singleplayermissions such as spythis game  the developers  digital extremes seems simply being very indecisive and polishes neither of the modes its of course a very different story if you eventually will be able to pull the meta  powergaming  minmaxing moves alongside being extremely lucky not only lootwise but also whether the other randomnumberelementsgods are not in the mood of simply stalling you read this game has large number of instabilityissues alongside on purpose yes they did reply as intented inconsistencyissues alongside many of the players on purpose dont want you yes you potential payingcustomer player to reach that point howeverapparently also theres the fact that people who did want this game to be less

to use any tools to emulate turboautofire when asked why couldnt this be an implemented option both de and most of the mastercommunity simply says this takes away realism & immersion and sometimes they masters say you shouldnt even bother playing this game with your equipments eg like logitechg500mouse if youre not coding or savvy with other 3rdcustomfiddlings i personally simply dont know what to call this kind of behaviorsemihypocrisy a summary of the players youre mostly going to find its one of the worst embodiment of fyigm or simply fygm please use searchengine on those acronyms unless youre going to find a clan  guild who indeed are willful to help you play through the content theyd personally need to repeat especially the quests which youll need to do in order to unlock new frames unless you want to dish out 20$ and over for them youre going to as being repeat hit the multiplayerlocked content i did mention mention the clanexclusive equipments and frames didnt i worse thing being that this game extremely griefingfriendly  want to stealoff the missionaccomplishment creditrewards from rest of the team rush to the extraction point and flag the other players being afk once the extractiontime ends  want to make sure people in defencemission wont get their rewards if theyd want to continue keep your vote on fightcontinue until the very last second and then quickly click

this freely even when there would be overflow bonus points if you rush the extraction and get rest of the afkflagged thus they wont getting their creditrewards  spy & rescuemission avoid stealth bonus points if you bounced a teammate into alarmtriggeringthings with the available weaponry eg grenadajumo  bounce with tonkor or tennoabilities aka abilities  magic  capture rush & trigger the fleeingmode on target and let him escape of course you wont getting any rewards either but so wont the others either bonus points if they picked up a some rareloot which theyre not allowed to keep now  sabotage rush & hope that the rnggods activate the meltdowncountdown sequence youll have to avoid reaching extraction point too to make sure everyone fails  interceptionwell now this is getting just silly but you can deny enemies from spawning by keeping their spawndoor open near  right next to  on many of the capturepoints techinicaly griefing regardless i didnt mention that the game keeps a public completionratio stats too so theres that too now where did i put that the game makes the communityvideo its a amazing that all these things are perfectly according to vision & intentions of the

as a veteran with 1100 hours of playing this game i simply dont recommend this this is nothing but a grindfest and the devs have repeatedly acknowledged about this but nothing has changed to lessen the grind every time they say that they are working on reducing grind they put in another grindwall which always bigger than the previous one here is a quote from a veteran who had already quited the game just like me i fully regret spending $250 on this game i fully regret providing you feedback i fully regret sinking 500 hours into this mess of a game but most of all i regret telling myself that itll get better ive had enough time for me to move on to better games games with a dev team willing to provide updates that are fulfilling games with a direction games with a clear vision

with a combat system a blend of mass effect and resistance and graphics a generation ahead of most other free to play titles youd expect this game to be good and yes for a free to play game it is but its not as good as the games it steals sometimes shamelessly from its everywhere in the game from the sliver of a storyline that exists to the weapons to the combat mechanics its unoriginal and not as good as the sources warframe takes inspiration from now im all for taking a great concept from another game and making it even better but its never been better the combat system is directly comparative to mass effect and while warframe has tried to move away from it even the ui used to be a dead steal from mass effect but again not as good excellent for a free title perhaps but the developer of warframe does not exactly lack the funding to make original content and thats my main issue with warframe they cant its like making a ww2 game called medal of duty or call of honor and branding it as something unique when digital entertainment the developer release a patch it tends to break the game after 2  years and 15 major updates although an inspiring amount you would think they would be able to at least check their own code before unleashing it on the main audience but something always breaks usually in spectacular ways a patch goes live to rebalance a warframe class and it breaks the matchmaking system sending you into a singleplayer game and the online chat into a singleplayer experience as well how or why the coding for a warframe has anything to do with the ingame chat system nobody knows rebalancing the game usually goes the same way as patches usually it fails and often in spectacular ways no matter if its your class your weapons or the enemies you use them on of course there is a forum for suggestions but unless complaints are voiced in the hundreds or more it goes largely ignored but i digress warframe is at its core a good game an original idea it never was and dont let anyone fool you there but a good game especially for a free to play title it does have a healthy view of what an ingame cashshop should be like and you never need to look at it to enjoy any aspect of the game sadly it is managed by a team of people who does not understand coding or game designing properly to maintain their original vision of what warframe should have been there are flaws in this game that have been flaws since warframe went live but that have never been solved to the point where one might wonder if they lost the original sourcecode somewhere along the way play this on a casual level if you are into free to play titles but dont waste your money on it from a design point of view warframe was always a mess and 15 updates later it is only worse than where it started

its just a grindfest with repetitive missions they have literally the worst experience for new players you literally have no idea of what to do but yes they explain controls because thats what the people never gets   also the devs are no longer doing the things right every update gets people to rage and stop playing the game dont be fooled by the reputation the game got in the past its pay2play since you need loads of slots to properly play the game if you try to grid your way up youll need at least 60 h of gameplay to already start playing the things that are worth farming the game its repetitive with only like 6 types of missions and it gets worse later on void the frames can be fun sometimes but there are only 5 types useless trash fast ones volt mages ember nova tanks trinitygodmode rhino and nekros also called the loot bot because you live to spam 3 so yeah repetitive gameplay conclussion play this if you cant afford to buy a game and you are really bored otherwise skip

due to support and not the game itself i have to give it a thumbs down for now the support is almost the worst i have ever had besides the first darkfall lastly be prepared to spend lots of real money if you want stuff in game the time it takes to gather materials and then wait on crafting times is unreasonable and they know it so what happens is you spend real money because after you have grinded for 100s of hours for much of the gear and waited days and weeks to craft it you get sick of the grind give in and pay real money to speed it up also the pricing of in game content is the highest i have ever seen in any game so in essence long grinds or pay money lots of money and bad support

the general gameplay and experience was fun while it lasted the whole game gets tedious and players can easily buy their way to success but that takes most of the challenge away ive lost interest in this game and so have many of the people that i personally know who played this game my clan is dead and many more have gone quiet generally warframe now has a lackluster feel for me i got used to the grinding but de just added more and then buffed the grinding with little annoying paywalls  that honestly generate more challenge unfortunately they nerfed across the board so it became more difficult for nonpaying players to effectively play i cant imagine this game having any longevity im serious i used to love the  out of this game but now its just complete crap as little money as i did spend on it after 300 hours of play i feel cheated longtime players founders and vets alike have been leaving andor disapproving of the games recent turn of events discontent is all over the forums de has become heedlessly distant from their fan base and gamming community i implore you to seriously consider not downloading this game

if you are going online with friends this might be up your ally because matchmaking is just painful in this game a bunch of software on your pc even your internet provider might collide with this game and it can inhibit the player joining a game or volunteering as a host that is even worse when the host changes during a long pvemission and some partymembers are no longer compatible with the host they are lost to the group and they lost their loot perpetually grinding for new gear that or youll have to open your wallet this results in p2w pve with its repetitive missions and absent story mostly exists to get you equipped for pvp which on the other hand can only be beaten with a good non pug it might be fun if you have good collegues a very good connectivity and the best gear you can buy then the other players are just prey in pvp or a nuisance in pve this leads to the paradoxon that the l33t wouldnt team up with n00bs but wont get decent matches either because there is no satisfying matchmaking system i strongly recommend playing with ingamefriends then you might have fun not because of the game but regardless of the game

think about all of the fun you had back in 2013 i would expect people to argue back to a negative review but there are plenty of negative reviews now the game has turned into a grindfest game as theres future updates and patches to make this game become pretty much a grindfest game back in those good old days where you actually do missions cooperatively its not like that anymore now to summarize it is still a good game played but on the inside theres grinding and repetitive missions to make this community almost unbalanced its certainly not fair for new players or players who want to come back and play this game

this game has some great ideas that were executed poorly i better just make a list pros nice ai the enemy ai and friendly if you happen to be playing invasion is pretty good for the most part enemies take cover and will retreat if you get too close varied enemies enemies come in all shapes sizes and roles some are offensive while others are defensive or provide support decent visuals not the best looking game out but definitely not an eyesore crafting system a double edged sword  the crafting system can be a blessing and a curse all warframes and weapons must be crafted unless you are willing to spend real money buying them while this is a great idea the costs and production times make this game into a massive grind mods mods add functionaility and bonus stats to your warframe and weapons wonderful idea unique abilities every warframe has its own special abilities each has its own role abilities add variety to the game and keep it interesting loads of weapons every warframe is equipped with a primary a secondary and a melee weapon there are so many different types of weapons playstyle options this is one of the few games that allows for a stealthy approach as well as a gunsblazing approach cons bugs so many bugs go unpatched that are reported the devs obviously dont care about the players endless grind the main reason to hate this game to do anything fun it takes hours and lots of patience terrible trading in order to trade you need to use a trading post which has a lot of prerequisites to build it will be a while before you have your own obnoxious wait times in order to build a warframe you need to find the blueprints for the three parts spend resources you probably dont have on hand buy the main blueprint after the parts are completed and wait 3 days for your new warframe this is complete garbage weapons take 12 hours rooms in the dojo take hours as well and so does destroying a room limited color selection in appearance panel sure its nice having the ability to color swap weapons and warframes and it is a good idea to limit the free colors but the selection available is too limited conclusion this game has some nice features and ideas but the devs have a lot to fix before i can consider this game worth a shot again after bugging through walls and having to restart boss missions because they glitch out i am done wasting my time

warframe has great graphics good controls for doing lots of parkour heaps of levels and tons of  to find these things make it one of the best free to play games ive ever played although it trys to prromote teamworkbut finding a group is can be a nightmare sometimes and then once you do there is hardly any coordination communication or teamwork involved it seems that you just go with other players to finish harder levels because their really hard solo there is also an extreme variety of warframes each with its own play style and powers and lots of weapons with different stats however almot all of these require premium credits which can almost never be found in the actual game which makes it all seem pay2win and then buying the blueprints requires you to spend hours searching planets for all the parts and then extra time to actually craft the item

after the general fun of the combat wore off i started dedicating a lot of time to minmaxing my warframe and sentinel with mods  however the developers repeatedly changed the game mechanics stamina change frames and sentinels sharing mods change in ways that screwed me over or left me far behind in progress from where i was right before the game update now that the game is a stable release this may not be a problem anymore but it left a strong sour taste in my mouth even with this fact aside it takes an extraordinary amount of time and luck to get better gearitems in many games you get small stat increases at relatively frequent intervals or relatively frequent gear drops although i think the weapons are supposed to be sidegrades the expensive and highrank weapons are much better albeit somewhat more situational than the defaults it takes a lot of materials to build weapons and a lot of luck to get certain blueprint parts to drop from missions these add up to a very grindy game with very slow progression

i want to recommend this game i really do i just cannot in good faith recommend something that has all the right components but willfully chooses to put them together so badly that it becomes unplayable without spending enormous amounts of cash what am i complaining about free to play mentality let me start by saying this warframe can be really fun with its coop play procedurally generated levels different game modes and huge range of weaponswarframemod options it certainly possesses the qualities that one looks for in an engaging and fun game unfortunately you can and will find yourself completely unable to progress or enjoy any of the fun features unless youre willing to spend real world money and heres why what bad developers do when it comes to f2p games is carefully design the games so that they are unwinnable for players who dont spend real world cash on the game the players get hooked then frustrated and then either ragequit or spend lots of money so that they have a chance to win this strategy works but is incredibly scummy and in no way deserves to be supported warframe performs this on many levels and has definitely lost my respect because of it to begin with the game starts you off with basic storyline missions which are fairly straightforward easy fun and more or less teach you how to play thats fine in fact they even let you choose your starting weapon and warframe which is great customization right off the bat it also works great for you in the first dozen or so missions until the questline is over just enough time to get you hooked into the game then comes the stick several missions in you will learn that this innocent weaponwarframe selection is one in which you can actually make a bad choice which essentially cripples you for every mission going forward at least until you get a new warframeweapon combo see the game doesnt ramp up the difficulty it just ramps up enemy hp and damage and the annoying hacking minigames and does so completely irrespective of the levels that it claims to be designed around this quickly leads to you getting out of your league in nearly every single mission most of which are required to be completed in order to unlock the new content essentially content progression works like this want a new warframe you can buy the blueprint for an ungodly amount of credits which are essentially game currency oh wait you mean you want to play with the warframe no no you need to build all of the warframe parts first how do you do that thanks for asking the game wont tell you but youll learn from other players that you basically have to do special boss missions a million times to find the blueprints for the warframes components blueprints which by the way also have huge credit and resource costs associated with them oh the resources you farm those from planets which you unlock from doing higher level missions and beating bosses what do you mean you cant beat the higher level missions solo oh you have a terrible warframeweapon combo well get a new warframeweapon then see how it loops back in on itself youre too weak to do the missions on your own so you try to get new weapons or warframes thats when you learn that you dont have the resources to build the new weaponsframes even when you do have the huge amounts of credits required the resources require planets you dont have access to the planets require missions you cant beat theres only two ways out of this loop of stupid and the first involves spending a huge quantity of real world cash to bypass the games requirements platinum real world cash gets you basically everything in this game from rush building items that would otherwise take literal days to build to buying weapons and warframes outright without having to collect a single resource to buying all of the rare and valuable mods or whatever from other players who spent the time to actually earn them its clear the developers knew exactly what they were doing when they made the missions impossible for new players they were creating a cash trap the second way of getting resources involves piggybacking this is technically an mmofps so that means theres other players around now you can go on the main chat and beg higher level players to let you tag along on their missions which is a decent way of earning the credits and resources required for doing literally anything in the game only problem is that youre then stuck following uber players around as they play the game and you watch you literally cannot harm the high level guys they are fighting and you die in one hit so youre more or less forced to trudge through mission after mission waching other people play in the hopes that someday youll be allowed to join in this is not fun this is not gameplay this is boring and frustrating and is the equivalent of being on an olympic sports team and being asked to follow the team around with a camera instead of playing wait i hear you ask what about players who are your level well speaking from an oceania perspective those dont even exist i cant tell you how many times ive sat waiting on a mission screen for someone anyone to come join me nobody does thats because theyre all busy piggybacking with high level players since the games progression is broken and moneybased in other words forget matchmaking even if you did find people your level youd probably also find that they were too weak to help much or a hindrance in the several missions which require stealth i wont even get into the terrible mechanics of stealth here but just know that its like assassins creed 1 if your assassin was a shopping trolley and enemies possessed the eye of sauron since once they see you they will never not be able to see you the bottom line is that warframe has so many tantalizing and interesting options which it then locks away in a gilded cage and tells you that you either need to pay for them with endless hours of your life or with real world money the irony is that i was willing to actually spend money on this game until i saw how badly they mistreat their nonpaying players and i just didnt want to be a part of that kind of system so ill be keeping my money and the hours of my life id otherwise have wasted on this game and investing both in something more productive and less horrifyigly abusive to its playerbase

when i first started playing this game it was really fun but once i progressed farther into the game it becaume rediculously repetative i felt like i was playing the same 5 maps over and over if there were more maps or even a different map for each level it would make the game much more amusing everything you can buy ingame is way to expensive the only point of the game is what exactly it seems all there is to do is grind to get a socalled better weapon but it sucks get another 40000 ingame credits and buy another  weapon not to mention the upgrading system

make no mistake warframe masquerades as a final product with no in development warning on steam and no mention of it still being beta anywhere but a tiny spot on the launcher back around update 7 when it launched on steam the game held quite a bit of promise for the future however digital extremes has decided its better to release a thousand new weapons and ignore many core gameplay problems than to work on creating actual content for the game they claim infinite replayability because the levels are procedurally generated each time you load one up but it settles into the same mindless grind of mid to high level diablo of go to where thing you want drops kill everything leave the game also goes from having far too much challenge before you can get the handful of core vital mods to be able to go past the first few planets and not only are there only a very small few of these mods but some are nearly impossible for new players to get to an endless stream of one shot kills on everything and its mother  and a number of warframes can clear entire rooms with skills alone with or without mods additionally digital extremes idea of a challenging boss fight is large area effect attacks and invulnerability phases as evidenced all of their revamped bosses one lephantis wasnt even particularly bad until they decided players were killing it too quickly and added damage caps to it not making the fight any more difficult just making it longer in addition the loot tables are so horribly bloated because des response to core problems nearly every enemy has a knockdown attack and its not particularly enjoyable parry is a useless gameplay mechanic is to release extremely niche new mods that compete with older infinitely more useful and versatile mods in your limited mod slots would you rather have 320% more shields do 30% more damage with your abilities have twice as much energy the games mana move 30% faster ora 95% chance to automatically block an attack with no noticible effect on incoming damage tldr its bad and i regret spending $50 on it edit 212 and now de has decided in an incredibly petty move to ban the leader of the top clan in warframe from the game entirely for forum posts made by other people i cant even think of anything to add onto that warframes community managers banned someone from the game entirely for something they personally didnt even do

i didnt play it that long just a couple hours but imo thats plenty long enough to know what a game is like i didnt really like it the shooting is ok the graphics are good but the freetoplay nonsense is all over this game i mean why not sell boxed copies or digital downloads since were on steam to fund your development of it and no i dont mean credit packs id really like a good spaceyshooter mmorpg but this thing needs more variety in level design and get rid of the lame paywalls make it fun first ultimately i just uninstalled it because i couldnt see myself enjoying this kind of thing for very long everything is a repetitive grind

i have been playing warframe off and on for years since it was in open beta  controls and gameplay that more often than not plays quickly and smoothly  the recent updates have been raising the bar in terms of visual effects and quality visually it belongs on the current gen platforms  combining gunplay melee combat and character abilities basically magic can feel very rewarding  overall the game is very simple to play and adds challenge as you progress  grind thats true for many f2p games but even with its randomly constructed levels the sense of repetition will set in very quickly grind to access the next tier of gear grind and roll on the random loot tables to get the blueprints needed for the new gear grind for the materials needed to build the gear and in some cases grind for items to sell for warframes ingame currency in order to increase the size of your inventory so that you can add the new gear while keeping your old gear as well  the rng there is no true distinction as far as rewards are concerned between a newer player and a veteran the highest level content requires the use of consumable items that are found in other missions and while a veteran player may be able to last twice as long as a new player before they are forced to end the mission and lose the consumable both the new player and veteran will be rolling on the same loot tables  bugs there are a lot of bugs and with every update that adds one new feature there is at least a week or two of bug crushing some minor repeatedly being disconnected from the main chat server to severe becoming trapped in geometry unable to fire your primary weapon or just glitched out without the option of continuing  new content adding new weapons and warframes is great but warframe encounters difficulties when making the new content balanced and most tragically of all fun the archwing missions in perticular a mode that holds many similarities to older thrid person robot shooters such as zone of the enders and slave zero is largely seen as a frustrating addition an opinion that was made more prevalent when new gear was made attainable solely through archwing missions overall warframe is a good game but it relies too heavily on cheap hooks like time gates pay gates and most of all the rnggrind gate for me to recommend it to anyone

dont get me wrong i love warframe and i do recommend that you at least try the game but through my experience with this game i have had nothing more than trouble game play is awesome endless hours of farming and grinding it is truely an mmo players dream however the game has far too many bugs that the support team refuse to do anything about from constant log issues to frozen ui the support team always recommend you allow the game to run through firewall no matter the issue personally i find no use in firewall it does nothing but slow me down and i keep my computer clean physically and digitally so for me i have no use what so ever for firewall and it is always disabled still everytime i run into an issue while playing which i must say happens literally once or twice an hour and report it to the support team they always tell me the same thing allow the system to run through firewall but when i exclaim to them that this cannot be the problem i am met with an apology and instructions on how to allow a program through firewall its a great game with a terrible support team my enjoyment in this game would usually tell me to rate it a 10 of 10 but the constant problems prevent me from giving it any higher than a 5 of 10

its difficult to properly review a game like this as its in a constant state of flux ive been playing since june 2013 and have 1000 hours logged so it must have something going for it either that or im mentally illaddicted ill probably keep playing for the forseeable future however i have taken breaks sometimes not playing for a month or more out of boredom or just getting fed up of the grind i enjoy the general aesthetic and the controlsvisualsgunplay are very good im mixed about melee the latter has been updated but still feels like im flailing idiotically in front of enemies warframe is a freetoplay game meaning the player has three options 1 grind and farm like a monkey 2 spend an unreasonable amount of money on ingame items 3 not give a sht about the former and just play the game anyway the grind in the game is sadistically insultingly steep as with most mmos you will be expected to do the same thing over and over just to obtain whatever item it is youre after in the space of two years i have noticed a steady increase in the grindyness of the game and more and more of it is being regulated by the most weighted rng i have ever seen this may or may not be related to a chinese chicken meat company owning a majority share of developer digital extremes perfect world is in there somewhere too what do you think the business model is fair enough the ingame currency can be traded with other players for certain ingame items so you neednt spend a penny pay to win is not really a thing here as its 99% coop but as mentioned the player needs to put time in re farm and farm hard the player can craft items from blueprints found in missions or bought from the market using the nonpremium ingame currency crafting time for items varies but is generally repulsive and initially offputting for many weapons can take up to 12 to 24 hours whilst others require one or two other weapons to already be crafted as components of said weapon frames new suitscharacters have to be acquired in four parts blueprint chassis helmet and systems these drop randomly from bosses rng is a god here and the drop rates are again repulsive 15 helmet parts in a row is a fact the player will have to face at some point each part takes 12 hours each to craft and when theyre all done the suit proper can be crafted which takes 72 hours you can rush crafting using premium currency or you can turn the game off for three days this is to say nothing of the materials required to make each part again found in missions randomly and dropped by specific enemies or not depending how lucky you are with the rng there is a special area called the void that can only be accessed by using void keys the mission types are exactly the same as the regular game but the enemies are slightly tougher and ascending in difficulty tower i being the easiest and tower iv being the most difficult what makes visits to the void desirable is the chance to be awarded a prime weapon or warframe part imagine having to farm for keys of a specific mission type that drop randomly amassing a collection of which completing twenty or so missions of the same type and finding  thanks to the diluted ridiculous drop tables  only one out of four parts to construct the prime weaponframe you had your heart set on the cash shop is disgustingly expensive you can buy a full game for the price of a gun here power creep is a thing and is very poorly managed qa is very poor in fact the pc players of the game probably are the qa team there are weekend events occasionally but these have been showing a steady decrease in quality and are becoming more and more buggy repetitive dull badly designed and poorly explained as a veteran player i find myself ignoring them completely they are wretched frustrating and a waste of time developers promise to alleviate grind and improve quality of life for the player then introduce double rng sandwiches and call it an exciting new feature almost every new feature comes with more stuff to farm but thats f2p i suppose theyve made a grindfarm game and are slowly removing the tools which make grinding and farming a little more bearable in fact a number of recent nerfschanges seem outright passive aggressive towards this community subset connectiononline play is still problematic after two years warframe uses p2p which often results in trainwrecks of lagridden unplayable bugfilled matches hosted by people playing the game on hardware unable to support the game properly and seemingly connecting to the internet using a 56k modem the game isnt optimized terribly well and in my experience doesnt seem to like amd hardware very much its updated regularly though new iteration breaks something else hotfixes are released quickly and their support team is  in my experience  excellent in the end the crux of the game revolves around destroying enemies upgrading weapons destroying enemies slightly easier with upgraded weapons and doing it all over again when a new warframe or weapon comes out its shallow repetitive and getting worse so get in when you can may as well give it a try entry is free though i still cant recommend it to others

this game has a horrible economy model that will sooner or later force you to either stop playing or pay real money for ingame goods the core gameplay is pretty fun and the graphics and aesthetics are close to perfect  original enemy designs excellent effects stunning tilesets wonderful ship designs  you name it the customisation is fantastic but it comes at a cost the only colours you have to paint your warframe and weapons with are dulleddown muddy colours with multiple shades of the same colour and not much inbetween you have to pay money to buy colours you get only 2 warframe slots and not nearly enough weapon slots for a varied loadout this forces you to constantly either sell old weapons [ie one of the 3 riflessecondariesmelees] to make room for a new one or go the sensible route and trade items for platinum in the universal chat what this involves is organising to meet up in either your dojo or the buyers dojo which must have a trading hub this isnt actually that bad until you consider the alternative to buying items with platinum and that is grinding crafting one warframe for example requires you first to get the blueprints for each of their parts the warframes system blueprints their chassis blueprints their helmet blueprints and their body you can often only get these blueprints from certain boss missions  but theres no guarantee you wont get a blueprint you wont already have then once you have all the blueprints you need a general warframe blueprint despite having a blueprint for each of the warframes parts you need to buy or find another one  and then it comes down to the actual crafting what this involves is roughly a 25000 credit cost to build each part  and then hundreds of each specified material at least one of which will be either an extremely rare drop [again from a boss] or something that can only be bought for platinum [read real money] not only is this expensive it is also timeconsuming  or rather it takes a given amount of realtime for each item to be crafted youre looking at 24 hours for a weapon or body part youre looking at about 3 to 5 days for a whole warframe of course the only reason this time barrier exists is so that they can shoehorn in another way for you to hand over real money  speeding the crafting process up costs yet more platinum this overall is a great game with excellent potential ruined by greedy developers ive seen too many people defending the game citing the fact that the devs have to eat too  it should not be at this cost so many other games have working economies whereby you can buy ingame items using real money but without having to  in other games it is a choice rather than a necessity

dont play waframe for a lot of different reasons the most obvious being the fact that everything is behind a paywall you cant advance at any pace without dropping money you can buy blueprints for warframes and weapons through the market with in game earned currency but unfortunetly you will never be able to unlock them because the materials needed to make said item require a key to be bought with platinum the purchasable currency to even unlock the levels stages tiers needed to farm the item you need players with bought weapons will be stronger than you pvp is a mess its even hard to progress through the story alone because you have a limited number of everything a f2p should always follow riot games pay model pay to look cool not to have an advantage over anyone else willing to drop a little cash to be better than you period

this may be tldr but do not worry i am going to break it dowin in to category nicley note that there are good and bad things about pretty much every category gameplay for the most part the gameplay is smooth and very resoponcive as the player is given access to three weapons to take in to battle a primary weapon a pistol and a sword or duel swords the shooting mechanics are a bit ordinary hold right click to zoom in all that jazz as the sword play at first is just as ordinary with sword play advances further with combos and such like things as one furthers themselves in the game note that there is only one combo unlock per stance so it does not progress that much although a well balanced sword can out damage most weapons in game with that aside this game will take you to a lot of different planets known and unknown alike on these planets every single mission is basically on one giant map cut in to different sections as some are reused or a player is simply spawned on the oposit side thn they were before so needless to say one planet means one look that you will get tired of really fast some on top of that are built in facilitys that make the dungeouns very constrictive so do not have your hopes up for a visually pleasing level design not to mention that most maps have a horrible layout that makes it impossible to take advantage of the jumping mechanics in this game such as wall running except for in particular portions where it is needed to cross a map it makes the mechanic feel like a gimmic and it plays as one as well the jump mechanics for the most part are terrible one of the most difficult challenges in the game is jumping from one platform to a higher platform because half the time the character will run up a wall and do a back flip leaving you further away from an objective or if one is taking fire from an enemy and wishes to dispatch him it takes at least 2 seconds to get up that small ledge as proper enemies can take away a large portion of healthshield given that opertunity crafting now this is the insentive to keep you going every single weapon in this game can be crafted as well as warframes for the most part it is enjoyable to grind through missions in hopes to get that last rare matterial needed for an item that will finally progress a character the down side is if you are planning on playing for free be prepared to wait a lot there is a wait period for every item crafted which would not be too bad except the least one has to wait is 10 hours most weapons take at least a full 24 hours and warframes take a whole 3 days they claim this game is not pay to win but they sure as hell put a lot of insentive on paying players geting what they want faster for example free playergrinds for blueprints fights boss three times in hopes of getting all blueprints for warframe 2 hours max grinds for all crafing matterials as well as cash 5 hours at least begins crafting warframe pieces all at once 12 hours warframe pieces are done begin final blueprint craft for warframe not like they could just let you put them together right thn and there after all those hours 3 day wait period that is the free to play model right there coop now this game is hard to play alone but it does start you off with 12 revives and rewards players with 4 revives daily so thats a nice litte feature to keep ya going coop is a must in this game and it is 5050 the community is good and willing to help out with a lot of nice people but more often thn not if one runs with random players they are going to have a bad time there are not that many new players in this game beyond the existing community so a majority of people one will find themselves teaming up with are vets with awesome gear and way op weapons which will drain the experiance from this game drastically as one runs missions trying to hunt for matterials to build a warframe these players will treat every mission as a race and dash to the finish line leaving you in the dust if you explore and look for loot you will not get any kills simply stumble across the map seeing an endless amount of dead bodies left behind <<every time this type of gameplay does not reward you with anything if one feels the need to explore and actually look around it is best to play with a friend or go in alone but if you do not care and let them race themselves to a red light that is fine go ahead and explore just beware once they get to that red light a countdown eventually begins that will take you away from exploring and eject you from the mission on top of that every other mission has a side objective with a nice cash bonus prize usually in the form of kills get 3 kills in 10 seconds get 5 kills while sliding get 30 kills with rifle things of that nature i enjoy this idea but with random racers joining in every other match they hog kills and assume you are not trying to complete that objective nor will they ask you the so called cooperation turns in to a competitive challenge which one can say goodbye to all crafting hunts and focus on beating this random player to the kills it can be entertaining but it forces one to play at a different pace and a different playstyle thn they may be used to and happening to often that it just does not seem worth it pay to win in the grand scheme it is a little pay to win that is for sure they claim that there are items that one cannot buy but must find through drops in the world i have yet to have come across any such thing i would not say that this game is pay to win but more like an over aptitude to push payment as the best option to play if there is something in the game you get they will have an option to pay pay to get rid of wait time on crafting materials pay to bypass crafting and get the item you want now pay for more revives hell pay for rare crafting items as well pay to unlock my color options for color pallet pay to get a new warframe now without wait there is just too much micro transactions that it constantly punishes player for not paying every little feature one can buy plus the prices oh my god the prices are horrible the lower end things cost around 5 dollars but warframes and weapons are expensive as  they have warframes going for over 20 dollarsand you bet ya that those warframes are damn near impossible to get in game through drops this is what you are dealing with while going in to this game i for one like this game a lot it is creative and fun but destiny is right around the corner and is this x10 with no  micro transactions this is a good game but way too many cons and way too many things they want you to spend money on i am sorry bot i will not recommend this game for the reasons listed

game used to be good absurdly overpowered things were added to the game nova de refuses to nerf nova because all the casual plebs that are bad have already begun to play only nova de then lies about creating prime variants of all the original frames before any newer frames and creates nova prime because they realize they can exploit the plebs of the game and make a lot of money game is  now this review will also more than likely be downrated into oblivion because the game is dominated mostly by weaboo casual mongos that somehow manage to fool themselves in to believing nova is fine

note this review is not based of any new content as nothing feels new the graphics and design are great and have 4 friends can make the game a little more enjoyable however the game will get boring for you really quick as each level feels the exact same as the previous just with a different objective to complete the levels are continously recycled and there is no real sense of progression you get from other games when you level up you dont feel any stronger than you did when you previously the crafting system is very hit and miss the ui for crafting is very solid and very easy to use but getting the materials needed to create the items in question is horrorendlessly bad the rare item drops needed to craft the items drop so rarely youll be grinding the same levels over and over just to get that one item that you wont feel very accomplished after getting it youll just feel like you wasted a lot of time the gameplay and sound for the game is actually really nice the weapons sound good and impactful the sword swings are refreshing to hear as you cleave your enemies in two and the controls are solid in closing i feel that the game could be much better but as it stands i cant find it as enjoyable as other mmos like world of warcraft or final fantasy xiv a realm reborn

this game is not a bad game dont get me wrong it has cool graphics nice gameplay and good customization the problem for me is the gap between veteran players and new players such as myself i found myself running behind this veteran players while they rushed clean the whole map while all i did was collecting the xp not that much fun you can play alone sure but that becomes very hard later on and there are some modes that require 4 players to play effectively getting the resources and warframes needed to make new stuff is not that hard as long as you have 3 veteran players that take you to a advanced map to farm resourceswhile all you do is hide when the vets clean the map try doing that alone and in low lvl maps its almost impossibleto get the needed resources the payed part of the game is a bit too much for me i wanted to spend some money on this but then i saw that is was more then 15 to unlock a new warframe i didnt find it pay to win since you can get all the stuff just by playing its just the prices they ask for are too high for me this is a cool game if you have the time to grind and farm until you become a vet yourself but i cant recomend this to new players i wish i could select a neutral review for this but i cant

i purchased one of the founders packs for warframe about a year ago finding that the game had very little substance i decided to quit i started playing again yesterday 7212014 to find that they had made some major updates to the game the layout of the solar map is very pretty now but the game still lacks substance the community seems horrible as well racism runs rampant in the chat room and the game gives you very little direction on what to do or where to go the tutorial gives the impression that weapons are found lying around the map waiting to be picked up but thats not the case three weapons can be bought from the market for the ingame currency otherwise the rest need to be made by buying blueprints the blueprints take on average twelve hours to make in the foundry and you can speed up the process by spending real money i understand that this game is free to play but it feels like there is a little to no progression aside from spending money all in all i give it a 510 its borderline okay

it was fun at first but quickly got boring and just became a game where you did nothing but kill the easy ai the multiplayer was ok but completely unbalanced and all new players got destroyed because of it it was sooooo hard to aim on this and i really didnt like having to miss 89% of my shots because of sensitivitywhich i like on high

at best you can say its a decent third person shooter  cons repetitive it seems that you play the same level again and again and again  in game currency is useless if you want something you must buy it with real money from weapons to revivalscolours  blueprints  i would rather give 20 bucks to have an unlocked game than to spend 60$ for useless points in a game that feels that is not finished  until the devs will get some sense into themselves i wont recommend this game

grinding simultor 2014 a nice game all round with nice visual effects and customization options but quite repetitive and boring towards midlate game pretty much grinding until you can find a new place to grind more often purely grind to get items that enable you to grind more in the places that you unlocked by grinding did i mention grinding 210 would not install again

warframe is very playable actual shooting feel twitch pveshooter which even sounds good but theres a big but pretty much all the information imaginable is hidden from the player thats just terrible game design considering the game is built around crafting new warframes and weapons aka reward mechanics every single player will encounter following issues which arent explained anywhere in the game sure you can check some of these from wiki but even then you need to know what to search eg i was confused about fusion cores  so i searched that from the wiki too bad there was no information which was relevant nor even link to fusion which was completetly other title  and had the exp tables i was looking for affinity orbs appear every few second whats that exp exp for warframe selected weapon everything modification & fusion cores theres separate rank and max rank which isnt said anywhere vs exp vs exp requirements for leveling up  major fckup here you can get components eg reaper handle  which you cannot find any information in the game youll just have to accept the fact that its a prime component without having any idea whats a prime or what do you do with one damage types arent explained anywhere im probably going to check the game out again every now 36 months just to see if theyve managed to add the relevant information which would make the actual playing fun

addictive but not for the right reasons pros addictive fun through getting better weapons frames and other items cons hard to find squads teams to play with on later half of missions due to there being 30 missions per planet and 12 planetssystems when playing with others its usually a speedrun where you dont contribute much because everyones grinding for parts the games only really fun solo but if you go solo and are not playing carefully its very easy to lose the mission and have to start over or use one of your 4 daily revives on many framescharacters and its not as fun to play solo as other coop games often feel like youre being baited by a carrot on a stick with promises of better items i find myself playing to get better items rather than because i want to play a game to shoot enemies there are a lot of bugs most are not game breaking sometimes i get stuck in a wall at the start of a mission though plat out of game currency is stupid expensive 50% more than lol unlike in lol where $10 might buy 2 champions 10$ here will buy you 15 guns or frames otherwise you have to farm several hours to get the parts for the item and then spend real world money for extra slots for the item or sell one of your other items after 80 hours my record shows 60 but i have 20 on another steam account because i accidentally forgot to log out of that you get a good enough frame and weapons to beat every level you can certainly get better items than what i have they just are no longer necessary to beat missions in a meaningful amount of time i 1 shot level 25 regular troops with my rifle

i want to be able recommend this game i really do but unfortunatly i cant the core gameplay is decent fun with the option to be stealthy or unleash your ninja skills in a full on attack however this games biggest problem lies outside of the combat getting new gear or warframes without paying requires waaay to much grinding to succesfully do and even after the days you spend grinding and finding materials you still have to wait several hours or several days before your thing is done crafting this is absolutly rediculous expecially considering how much platinum premium money costs i could buy several games with the amount of money it costs just to buy a couple warframes its just not worth the time or money to try to play this game

yknow im gonna be honest here its a fun game it really is but its a grind  its a free to play but if you want some of that cool stuff like those helmets and other unnecessary accessories for your warframe youre either going to have to grind some prime parts to sell for platinum if you just despise giving the game developers their money because that makes them greedy s sarcasm there or shell out cash because you actually support the game the first option is better i havent bought any platinum i got it all through trading you start off with 50 platinum but you cant really do much you can buy two warframe slots and something thatll cost 10 platinum 4 weapon slots and have 2 platinum left or 1 warframe slot and 2 weapon slots your call thats nice so i guess you cant complain there the issue falls on the pricing its so expensive and the exchange rate from dollars to platinum is a little funky i wont delve too deeply but hey its not mandatory to buy it at first i was like hell yeah ninjas in space this is the greatest thing ever and its free  but now that i play it more i sorta just have to look at the amount of hours i put into it and ask why you basically just do the same thing over and over you dont get to interact with any sort of npc in missions were not including relays those are hubs and if you manage to find one chances are youre just killing them because its an npc theres no real plot there for us to follow unless you spend a lot of time scanning everything and playing through all 200 missions on every isolated planet where people never really seem to go but before you bash upon those who like plot the only sorta plot im getting here is that im really the bad guy here or something like that once you do all the missions you sorta just do nothing you beat the last mission  what now wheres the final boss now for items  gotta build them or buy them already made i can understand the game makes you grind for the blueprint parts to make those nice aklex or dakra prime or that epic nyx prime instead of shelling out 100 platinum for an easily grindable gun or sword makes you feel better after waiting 12 hours for that sword or gun and 3 days for that warframe that other guy bought for like 100 bucks in a pack or something in regards to customization theres so many other colors you can choose from but you gotta pay for them even the classic colors in which they give you only one column to choose from youd think theyd give you the first palettes for free but nah just one column thats lame but yknow not really mandatory part of me wants to recommend this game to you and my friends because for a while its actually pretty fun yet the other part of me wants to say to not play this game and use your time elsewhere because its a grind grinding only lasts you for so long it just depends on the kind of games you like dont get me wrong its not a bad game its just a rather time consuming game as shown by my 200 hours if youre some achievement hunter going for achievements in this game boy do i have some news for you in the end if you dont mind the grind get it if youd rather not spend the time grinding away all your depression in this game dont get it its free either way

an example of a company having a cool idea and handling it terribly in the closed beta you could have more fun with breaking the game in interesting ways such as running at 500% speed and it has steadily gone down since then the company abuses power quite often on both the forum and the game while leaving the game riddled with bugs

while i used to enjoy this game greatly the devs continue to make it more and more absurd to try to unlock any of the new content without paying for it walls upon walls of rng combining together to make it dozens of hours for some of the gear if you ever see it prime equipment and the new warframes are particular offenders of this downvoting until i see some real dedication to changing their tactics less rng stacking let interesting cosmetics make you money from a happy playerbase that feels its not just hoping for the dice to roll in their favor there is no progress in rng just luck

its fun but gets boring really fast in this game u can run around with some ppl shoot and melee enemies thats about it it not difficult at all and offers almost no cooperation i felt like the coop mode was more like a race to the finnish i can tell alot of work was put into the game and it runs smoothly it really looks like a nice game but after u play a couple levels ull find thats its kinda like the same thing over and over again i really dont mean to downvote it its not really a bad game i only down voted it because i personally dont enjoy it its kinda good for a free game its got alot of customization and main menu stuff but the actual gameplay dispite the graphics can be found in like a internet browser arcade game

warframe  well there is not a lot to say about it after 40 hours even without discovering the depths of the game i stop i like  there are 3 different warframes from which you can choose one when you finish the tutorial  there is a tutorial  there is a kind of a story mod with missions like stealth assassination defense etc  you can play almost any mission coop  there are around 370 moods to choose from which determine your skills  your warframe can choose almost any weapon or mod what i did not like at all  my game crashes all the time after the new patch some people have same issues the game offers this solution httpswarframecomhardwarefail  the revives in missions are limited per day there are four  crafting good weapons and other stuff takes hours of game play finding blueprints and the resources  the first warframes you can choose from are really bad compared to the others my opinion  there is no lvl cap for missions so you have new players or experienced players which just solo the whole game  almost everything can be bought for real money  there are a lot of game play bugs  most players dont care about team play all in all i give warframe a 410 mostly because my game is crashing all the time but still in my opinion there is a lot of work that has to be done by the admins and the development crew your flaming ace

i really really enjoyed my first few hours with the game the action is fast and fluid and the early missions are straightforward and fun however the difficulty soon spikes to an outrageous degree and missions become a nightmare of confusing direction and deadly enemies with a mystifying ability to spawn behind you coupled with a very very slow progression scheme that is stingy with new abilities and weapons which makes it boring and a generally dark lighting scheme which makes it hard to see whats going on i am no longer having fun warframe had an amazing opportunity to be great its fundamentals are solid but it comes from the school of make people pay to advance faster school of thought rather than well make it so fun people will be happy to spend money perspective thumbs down

slide on the floor and use super powers to fight the same three types of enemies across a solar system of narrow hallways and bright colors warframe is a mix of most every scifi shooter game from the past decade and did prove amusing in parties with friends however the amusement was short lived limited levels and enemy types accompanied by lengthy grinding caused me to burn out rather fast on the title there are also pay to win weapons thankfully the game is cooperative however this will not stop public players from joining a game and stealing all the drops note i did spend 55hours with this game and im told the developers plan to release many more things including an open world play mode

another f2p skinner box that barely qualifies as a mmo with each major update the developers continue to dilute the drop tables nerf abilities and game mechanics that they decide doesnt fit in with their idea of good gameplay and continuously introducing new content that would be nice if it actually provided more than maybe a day at most of content to actually go through instead of addressing the problems with the content they shove into this game and expect you the player to bugtest because this game is still in beta digital extremes rather just ignore the glaring problems because there are still people dumb enough to waste money on this game for fancy accessories and the latest items so they dont have to suffer the awful rng at best you can expect this game to be a fun casual grinding experience but if you have half a brain youll likely begin to realize how flawed warframe is the more you play it

i used to enjoy this game quite a bit but not so much now the amount of time you need to put into this game is insane just to get a few parts for a weapon due to the over saturation in certain areas of the game practically everything in this game is based off of rng random number generator this includes resources enemies youll incounter mods all the way to the rewards thatll an alert will have the amount of time you will spend grinding in this game for items is not worth the reward anymore if youre looking for a game to waste time with go for it just be ready to put thousands of hours into this game if you hate games with lots of grind and farming this is the wrong game

there isnt really much that sets this apart from other games dont know why people call this a masterpiece of game design and dont know why people hyped this up so much heres what i understand about the game from the countless videos and 2 hours that i played of the game  endless grindwalls and microtransaction temptations at every meaningful gameplay decision  undocumented stealth nerfs and obfuscating excuses for these changes by developers  unfinished projects explained away by the promise that these features will be fixed at some point in the future  a lack of transparency between developers and players  a clear lack of direction for exactly what the game wants to accomplish  game developers who constantly run away from their mounting selfcreated problems overall rating 310 next game please

crashes every 8 to 10 minutes ruin each longlasting mission making it impossible to develop your character properly the problem appeared a long time ago and it still hasnt been fixed yet the developers seem they dont know how to fix it at all

operation false profit is complete trash there was very obviously no quality control in this event i am not going to restate what everyone else is saying so i am just going to copy paste just4tehlulzs response so we realize nobody likes monotony hell de even says they hate having to run one mission 5 times for an invasion what do they do for the new operation makes us have to run it a minimum of like 12 times this isnt even including bugs stupid  rng which makes it not spawn and other uncontrollable factors with these taken into account the number is closer to 25 or 30 were gonna be as transparent as possible youre about as transparent as chinas water with this event de you didnt share with us that all offerings give you the same amount of points while one takes quite literally 5 times longer to do furthermore its pretty damn insulting that you guys advertised this as an event to make good amounts of money along the way but you think people who are willing to drop 100k on some stupid glitchy card and most likely not actually get compensated with due to bugs give half a  about 1120k credits that amount is laughable considering the amount this event has taken from me due to bugs finally either you guys must be trolling or your new concepts for enemies as of late has been complete trash we already hate perma cc and stupid  scoprion hooks what do you give us an enemy that makes the jackals special ability like a ing dad joke while being able to pull and drag you if the normal release of these enemies is even remotely close to what they are now it will be ing disgusting this event has been so egregious and frustrating that it is physically exhausting

this game has a horrible economy model that will sooner or later force you to either stop playing or pay real money for ingame goods the core gameplay is pretty fun and the graphics and aesthetics are close to perfect  original enemy designs excellent effects stunning tilesets wonderful ship designs  you name it the customisation is fantastic but it comes at a cost the only colours you have to paint your warframe and weapons with are dulleddown muddy colours with multiple shades of the same colour and not much inbetween you have to pay money to buy colours you get only 2 warframe slots and not nearly enough weapon slots for a varied loadout this forces you to constantly either sell old weapons [ie one of the 3 riflessecondariesmelees] to make room for a new one or go the sensible route and trade items for platinum in the universal chat what this involves is organising to meet up in either your dojo or the buyers dojo which must have a trading hub this isnt actually that bad until you consider the alternative to buying items with platinum and that is grinding crafting one warframe for example requires you first to get the blueprints for each of their parts the warframes system blueprints their chassis blueprints their helmet blueprints and their body you can often only get these blueprints from certain boss missions  but theres no guarantee you wont get a blueprint you wont already have then once you have all the blueprints you need a general warframe blueprint despite having a blueprint for each of the warframes parts you need to buy or find another one  and then it comes down to the actual crafting what this involves is roughly a 25000 credit cost to build each part  and then hundreds of each specified material at least one of which will be either an extremely rare drop [again from a boss] or something that can only be bought for platinum [read real money] not only is this expensive it is also timeconsuming  or rather it takes a given amount of realtime for each item to be crafted youre looking at 24 hours for a weapon or body part youre looking at about 3 to 5 days for a whole warframe of course the only reason this time barrier exists is so that they can shoehorn in another way for you to hand over real money  speeding the crafting process up costs yet more platinum this overall is a great game with excellent potential ruined by greedy developers ive seen too many people defending the game citing the fact that the devs have to eat too  it should not be at this cost so many other games have working economies whereby you can buy ingame items using real money but without having to  in other games it is a choice rather than a necessity

so to start off my review of this game beforehand a long time ago this game used to be one of my favorites but now with the constant hotfixupdate failing due to internet connection reset or it simply not ever downloading the updatehotfix i have grown sick of the fact that i cannot play this game during the weekdays due to the fact i actually need my sleep the update servers must be connected in some form or manner to the log in and maybe even game servers as during normal mass play times the updater simply just doesnt update the game many threads have been made and none answered by developers which pains me to say i would love for the updater to actually use my download speed over just not download at all or at painfully slow speeds until this painfully slow or nonexistent speed is fixed up it is really hard for me to want to recommend this game to any of my friends

this game holds your hand every step of the way regularly reminding you of what you need to do next is very much so a freetoplay game regularly reminding you that you can buy things the guns are ridiculously accurate at any range one of the enemies runs at you from very far away with a big knife if you want content that you get nickled and dimed for and have someone constantly tell you what to do next then by all means play this game otherwise its just an above average free to play game

this game is so good it crashed my pc for 2 days the first two times it crashed it went back to windows the third time really crashed the computer my computer didnt send any signal to screen nor keyboard first i though the power supply died so i swapped it still the same then i took out the harddrive and tested it in another computer no problem there either eventually i was afraid it was the motherboarduntil i let my pc run for 15 minutes at that time it rebooted itself and finally went to windows and started sending signal to the screen this computer is 2 years old with windows 7 and rigged for armed assault iii no other game has crashed it this badly even arma 3 so if you can run this game smoothly without problems and enjoy it good if it crashes really badly the first time consider this as a warning and uninstall the game to prevent possible damage to your computer did i already mention this is the only game that has managed to take down my computer for longer than a day being free with good gameplay doesnt matter much if it can crash my pc for long periods possibly damaging it i would have given this game thumbs up if it didnt crash every 15 minutes and harder than other games edit this game alone managed to kill my graphics card which didnt show any dying symptoms before

this honestly is a very well made game at least i think so it mixes rpglooting elements commonly found in hack nslash games with a 3rd person shooter game like gears of war for example the problem is the lack of variety throughout the entime game youll be leveling up your gear grinding for hard to find mods and resources all to fight the same basic variety of enemies they have just 3 factions of enemies in the entire game from start to finish epic bosses they finally added one with the orokin derelict missions but other than that they are all non meaningful and easily forgotten i played this game for a while until i realized whats the point whats the point of grinding to find better gear to constantly fight the same enemies on the same levels in a world that never changes at all

i started this game back in version 70 and it was amazing i spent enough time on it to make it worth spending cash on it and it didnt disappoint when update 10 came out i was a bit warry of the new ui and redone stamina system but all in all it was still great then version 11 came out they completely remade the damage system ruining many peoples builds changing the weaknesses of the enemies limiting your options dramatically melee weapons became almost useless formerly amazing guns were now junk and everything you spent money on was wasted the time and effort people put into this game when they loved it when it wasnt overcomplicated was good i loved the game but change is always makeorbreak for anything and in this case it broke me ill look back fondly on my time playing the game but that was a different time pros space ninjas graphics audio cons cash items are overpriced takes forever to craft things takes even longer to get the parts to craft them dont even get me started on neurodes damage 20 made things far more involved all the remakes of the maps are harder to navigate its now hard to distinguish enemies from friends and those from the terrain boss changes that make no sense harder to navigate the menus than it used to be your character even gets in the way now

the games repetitive and boringalso they screwed over like 90% of the pc fanbase that went to ps4 like myself by removing the transfer account option just so they could screw us out of our hard earned things in the pc version and all the money we spent alsoregarding the pc versionwhy does it not truly have full controller support you have it with your console versiona and the gui on the pc version has clearly been reworked for controllersso why do i still find myself constantly having to switch over to my mouse to use about 60% of the ui it just seems nonsensical to me also i feel like this game gets rewarded and praised for what aaa titles get cracked down for repetitive gameplay constant grind boring uninspired linear gameplay and level design you knowwhat every other pc player out there es at other shooters for also quite a bit of the game is a shade of browna last gen console thing that was constantly harassed and criticized sowhy isnt this for doing that all in all the hyposcrisy is ridiculous and so is the cash shopits give or take about 5 dollars for a new weapon and 1015 for a new warframe which is ludicrous sure you can earn them in gameby grinding out for like 30 hours hoping you get the right materialsand the right plansand have enough creditsand then to top it all off you have to wait as much as 3 days for it to be builtan even larger slap to the face and another roadblockand half the time it isnt even worth the effort its high grind lowreward is assinine and i hope this doesnt become a trend for future titles that this studio may publish

after spending 100s of hours playing this game i can verify that this game is initially extremely fun to play however once youve gotten to a certain point in the game where youve done all the missions and have certain weapons you prefer the game loses its sense of entertainment besides the fact that the game is already completely littered with irritating grinding scenarios just to be able to use a new gun or do a special mission theres no campaign nor any sign of the developers approaching a campaign any time soon another major issue is the huge lack of love for veterans in this game the games answer to dull gameplay is simply releasing more and more weapons and warframes warframes are ok but the ratio of weapons is ridiculous 1 decent late game weapon will get released to every 56 newbie weapons that get made and to a sense theres nothing wrong with that however anyone who plays games is going to know that going for late game is more important because it makes doing events and bigger more difficult missions easier its the point of becoming stronger yet this game bombards new players with too many weapons some of which are completely useless and finally the amount of involvement that whatever amount of story supposedly exists in this game is nonexistant the point of having the events and picking sides was for the players to determine the future of the games history and yet if everyone decides to side with the evil side the good side will always win or the developers try to make it a no brainer for the players by making one reward completely trash in comparison to the other sides reward i wish i could get back into this game but at this rate its almost like keeping up with a comic that you wish would move on and get to the point you check back in every month or so just to see whats changed or what hasnt happened and then you ignore it for another month or so its frustrating to say the least all in all its a well made game but the developers arent listening to the community like they said they would its a shame too

warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play after those few enjoyable hours youll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in its combat enemies and game play the one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semifrequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the games systems new warframes and other tweaksfeatures its a good game to play casually though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding the upside to all of this is that the game is free so id recommend trying it out if youre looking for a quick fix try it out there are better games out there

i know technicaly warframe was based around the pve and all but one of the reasons i played it so long was to get better stuff and play with them in the pvp and now they have changed warframe settings so that everyone entering pvp is stuck with unrankedunmodded gear and frame so testing builds out in the pvp is no longer useful and testing out how your build holds up against others no longer works either now all that matters for the pvp is that you have the higher base stats the pve is ok but it seems like it gets a little too easy after a time with the right build and game type you coul literally endlessly destroy your enemies i use a simple valkyr with high ranked armor and a blade that drains hp for every hit with that alone i cannot be killed instantly and i can heal back everything it does to me so in a defense match i could literally just sit on the defend zone and cut up anything that comes especially if its an infestation map with only melee units atleast with ranged units you still need to dodge deflect and run around in order to cach your enemies but its pretty much the same thing for me the other pve game modes make it a bit tougher to tank and all since you have to move around quickly though a maxed rush mod fixes valkyrs weakness there and when in doubt just using ripline can get you around faster then almost anything else so i guess valkyr would be the cheapest warframe there is especialy with the hp drainin attack with the right mods you could probably make the other frames just as cheap though so its just a matter of your visual tastes on your character i guess anyway i probably wont be playing this game again unless they make a way to choose wether to have an unranked pvp or not atleast that way then if people wanna go with all unranked items its their perogative dont force unranked and unmodded items on everyone

warframe was a great game for a couple of week after that it got boring most of the map and mode are the same they just remodel the map most of the time youve going to be farming for the weaponwarframe parts the drop rate is it very good when you make a weapon or warframe it take to long like 12 hours if youve not going to rush it with real money the weapon and warframe on market can be purchased with real money like 10 to 30 dollar for it then you have you mod the weapon or warframe to make it more powerful the weapon and warframe slot are limited you have to spend real money to unlock some slot sure they give you 50 cash to buy thing but you cant use those 50 to trade with people sure you can trade with other people for the parts if you have the cash for it warframe have a lot of bugs and glitches the game have been updated quite a lot time and some old bug have not been fix yet the game keep crashing the chat log loading to long stuck in the menu while selecting a mission stuck in the loading screen engine crash server down a lot of times etc

the problem with this game is simple it never feels like youre progressing because every step you take just opens more and more meaningless grind opportunities and every update just piles more and more to it be a new frame weapon mod or resource that there are mods so essential to your progress locked behind a shit of a rng is one of the most stupid and hostile gameplay designs i have encountered add to that the gameplay changes they do every now and then nerfs that make your already  weapons completely useless changes to damage types and values new weapons that completely outclass the previous ones new resources that require more grinding etc and it all becomes meaningless and disheartening and if you want to play solo youre in for a world of hurt with so much grind rng locked content and 4 player balanced missions a lot of then required to unlock new planets and with it resources its not worth it so i stopped playing nothing changed nothing got better or made the game more fun or less of a chore quite to the contrary most of my playtime was spent trying to get the essential mods so that my weapons become useful enough to kill waves and waves of enemies quickly for me to solo through the missions and unlock new planets where i would repeat the same process while slowly gathering resources and blueprints to craft a marginally better weapon or frame that would become useless by the next update rinse and repeat ad infinitum

after spending 100s of hours playing this game i can verify that this game is initially extremely fun to play however once youve gotten to a certain point in the game where youve done all the missions and have certain weapons you prefer the game loses its sense of entertainment besides the fact that the game is already completely littered with irritating grinding scenarios just to be able to use a new gun or do a special mission theres no campaign nor any sign of the developers approaching a campaign any time soon another major issue is the huge lack of love for veterans in this game the games answer to dull gameplay is simply releasing more and more weapons and warframes warframes are ok but the ratio of weapons is ridiculous 1 decent late game weapon will get released to every 56 newbie weapons that get made and to a sense theres nothing wrong with that however anyone who plays games is going to know that going for late game is more important because it makes doing events and bigger more difficult missions easier its the point of becoming stronger yet this game bombards new players with too many weapons some of which are completely useless and finally the amount of involvement that whatever amount of story supposedly exists in this game is nonexistant the point of having the events and picking sides was for the players to determine the future of the games history and yet if everyone decides to side with the evil side the good side will always win or the developers try to make it a no brainer for the players by making one reward completely trash in comparison to the other sides reward i wish i could get back into this game but at this rate its almost like keeping up with a comic that you wish would move on and get to the point you check back in every month or so just to see whats changed or what hasnt happened and then you ignore it for another month or so its frustrating to say the least all in all its a well made game but the developers arent listening to the community like they said they would its a shame too

i only played for 15 minutes the intro and one mission then i was left to try and figure out where to go next and for some reason everything was locked off and i couldnt go further and tbh i couldnt care to go further if you enjoy it great but i found it to be esoteric and terse which is not a very good feeling to have by a new player maybe in the future when i feel like checking it out i will google some video tutorials on youtube but not tonight

the frame rate of this game is terrible good graphics looks fun to play but horrible frame rate

simply stated dont call a game free to play when you have to pay real money to have any sort of fun microtransactions are the biggest pain in the  in the gaming world this game feels more like some ea pos rather than an independent developers and by the way your new update killed the game for me completely

if you like farming for 12 hours for blueprints then waiting literally days at a time to build said blueprints then running out of weaponframe slots you have to pay real money for this is the game for you  you de i wasted so much  time on this worthless piece of  that you put no effort into making good this had potential you could have made a fun game but no all you cared about was making the most expensive free game in existance at least cod even with all its dlc didnt force you to buy money at some point at least cod had an excuse of already being  from the start god damn games used to be about fun they used to be beautiful and people cared about them now theyre all just about money

the gameplay is entertaining and if you enjoy colecting and min maxing it is fun but the game still has many bugs and assort problems the in game market is completely inconsistant and the developers dont seem to have any intention of fixing it for example you can only trade if you are in a clan a guild of kind that bought a trading post and you are extremely limited to number of trades equal to level per day as well as a trading tax there are small bugs that have been in the game for months and are yet to be fixed as well nothing game breaking but anyoing to continue seeing heath orbs fall out of lockers and float there by far the thing that bothers me the most and in fact angers me is the in game market there are multiple game features that are basic to the game and one would assume would be apart of it that in fact you must pay real money to achive for example color and custimaztion i understand having to buy different models and complete cosmetic items but when the default color choices are not open to you unless you pay five dollars when your starting colors are one row out of many in unsaturated color options and you even have to pay five dollars to unlock the other rows in that unappealing color palet it seems a bit insane the worst thing of them all is the audacity to tell players and allow players to get items in game because yes you can buy almost all the items in the game for real money but you may also find and make them in game but what they dont make obvious at first is that you have limited storage space so if you buy a warframe or a gun with money you automaticly get the space for the item but if you were to make it yourself in game you do not get the alloted space and must buy platnium the real money in game curancy to even buy inventory space for you item over all the game is very fun but the constant need to buy things with real money and various small bugs as well as the idiot design choices for some game functions are holding the game back not to mention the game is horrible unbalanced as one can get to the point where nothing is really a chalenge

this game had promise it is too bad that it was ruined by the f2p pay model after only a few missions it forces the player into a grind session just like any other f2p game instead of focusing on game mechanics design and fun the game is about repeating the same stupid levels over and over and over just to get enough credits to upgrade an absolutely necessary mod by one degree or just to get the mod in order to advance through to the next mission i would have gladly paid $60 or even a monthly fee to play a game with real content and real fun too bad this game chose the f2p model theyll not get a cent from me

i dont really understand what was wrong with this game for me it was rather blocky and constantly was imposssible for me to shoot people it was constantly lagging which i dont understand because i have a fairly good gaming computer and great wifi it would be a great game for those who do not have these problems

cant recommend this game wasted too many hours on it devs and community moderators have incredibly questionable practices they continue to dilute and obfuscate drop tables and make the game as grindy as is possible power creep is absurd and their money grabbing is just getting out of hand i just uninstalled it recently due to certain recent events on the forums between players the devs and the generally useless community moderators dont get this game

boo its too fast paced the combat is too repetetive for very little reward or progress while its free to play its almost pay to win the free options require an incredible amount of time to acquire the simplest of weapons grinding for parts against boring enemies for hours on end only to have to wait 12 a day to assemble a single item i may have not played the game for the required 5 hours before reviewing but a group of my friends play this despite my protests i have witnessed enough should you decide to play the game choose your starting class wisely for you may be stuck with it awhile

i was excited about it until i actually tried it it looks cool and id recommend it to people that havent played many shooting games it has cool moves the graphics are decent and you get to use different types of weapons unfortunately the ai isnt exactly smart and the character you control is a bit overpowered plus you get way too much ammo and health and power regeneration its way too easy it looks pretty its relaxing its free and the classes look nice but it didnt really manage to draw me in in all honesty i dont have much to say i got bored on my first mission and quit so maybe it gets better as you progress its not that it really is that terrible overall but i got bored too early so i do recommend it to casual gamers that just want some parkour tricks and some good old slashing and shooting of aliens but it really isnt anything special a lot of easy to kill foes and an endless pursuit of loot if youve already played a bunch of alien shooting games and have high expectations about this one spare yourself the disappointment

this is one of the worst coop mmos out there as it doesnt actualy focus on the coop but on the grind yes grind this game is nothing but a 24 hour grind with bosses the most intense moment in the entire game was when i crashed after a very important mission then again and then again this amount of crashes is unbereable not taking in that the game is extremely bugged and textures often get stuck in players and enemies but as i said this game is nothing but grind you grind to get a pet you grind enemies to get to the boss you grind the same area over and over just to obtain one more ceramics or whateverthe you need right now the weapons take immense amount of grind to actualy even get the blueprint then you need to get the required items that means yes you guessed it more grinding then finaly if the starts are right and you have enough of items and credits you can finaly wait yes wait whole whoping 12 hours for your new wepon to actualy get completed this isnt a multiplayer game this is a great grind simulator you do nothing else but grind so if you are looking for a way how to kill time and love grinding away this game is for you but if you are a noraml and social person you will probably enjoy this game only when playing with friend i would give it a 410 thus i dont recommend it to anyone that doesnt plan on playing with friends or hates grinding

the short and sweet review an addictive game at first its pleasing graphics and myriad of missions and play options will keep you fairly entertained its myriad of bugs and issues will not this game like many of the latest pay to win mmos demands a lot of time be invested if youre only in it for the free content this means daysweeks of grinding to get that weapon you want and for most of us this is an option we can live with what we cant live with having spent the last hour or two grinding only to see the game drop connection and the reward you work so long at lost this unfortunately can happen time and again and is especially prevailent after large patches  the latest being 18gb eventually this becomes tiresome and the complete lack of storyline however means the only thing that keeps you going is the greed of growing your arsenal purchasing additional slots for weapons and warframes is something invetable expect to have to dish out your hard earned cash within as little as two to three weeks if you play often the programmers insure that somewhere along the line if you want to progress and grow your arsenal youll need to spend real money this is called a paywall some will argue you can trade items ingame to make other purchases ingame but the programmers have ensured that this platform remains simplistic to ensure that it does not affect their profits there is no market or auction house and instead there is a single spamchat window with hundreds if not more of players selling items items drop rates are also regulated to ensure that if a particular rare items drops for one person it will become only so much harder for the next person to obtain a particular weapon may also start out as being fun and overpowered only to end up on the scraphead of has been weapons with a current stream of new and improved weapons being available to purchase ingame and then eventually made available to the masses and the envitable grind required to get it eventually again its nerfed rinse repeat all in all the programmers will ensure they get their monies worth out of you and this game can quickly become as expensive as eve which can easily cost the equivalent of a new ps3xboxpc game every month if dont mind spending the cash and youre looking for nothing more than blowing off a little steam this game  when its working  can do just that for you throw into the mix a possible takeover by pwe and you can bet your sweet  you wont be happy that you did id recommend checking the reviews again in a year or so to see if the programmers have listened to their existing customers it sucks when you one promotes and supports the developers by purchasing ingame items only to find theyd rather focus on new content and making more money than resolving existing bugs this game needs another year of serious devtime

ive rewritten my review about four times now and each time has been a fairly positive review until now currently warframe isnt doing that great many players are sitting around in a state of impatience for new content and the many updates weve had still has not satisfied many players we are missing many things such as polish endgame and fixes to some current issues as much as id like warframe to succeed i cannot recommend the game to anybody looking into playing it other than the issues we have and the things we are months later than we should have them getting into the game is extremely difficult and time consuming even 200 hours in i doubt you would be even close to top tier content unless you were really good are good at studying a game wikia and had help by the time you get as far as i have you will very likely feel unsatisfied with where warframe currently is and with the lack of content to go by you will also be frustrated with digital extremes for not releasing any good content and you will hope from update in to update out that de will release something great but in the end you will be sorely disappointed i intend to change my review to a yes if they start making good releases and show that they know what they are doing but until then i intend to give a no take care xievie

pure grinding the grinding emphasis is so strong that most games are just people running through the levels ignoring all enemies to the end to finish the stage and get the rewards new players will be lost as they try to fight and actually play the game it becomes a look how fast i can run through this stage simulator graphics are cool story is cool gameplay idea is cool though everything got exploited into a weird grindy running game many people will enjoy this no doubt i didnt get hooked though and i love grindy games

warframe can be fun however a few things really ruin the game in the long run if you want a new weapon for instance you first have to grind credits to buy the blueprint then grind mobs just to get materials for the weapon while also grinding for credits to actualy craft the weapon and then you have to wait 12 hours just for it to be crafted sure its fun to run missions but not over and over and over again just for a small item if you want a warframe on the other hand you have to grind missions for the credits to buy the blueprint and then grind a certain mission to get all the components of the warframe and then just grind for the materials for crafting all three of the components of the warframe which then you have to wait 12 hours just to craft one of the pieces you can craft all three at once and then you have to grind missions to get enough credits to pay for the cost of combining all three pieces and wait 72 hours just for a new character new warframes have different abilities and stats but still use the same weapon so gameplay usually isnt that different if you dont heavily use abilities however if you use abilities gameplay between warframes can be highly varied and the stats do change quite a bit however if you dont want to grind for weapons and new warframes you can simply pay 2550 dollars for a warframe 25 for just the warframe and its abilities and 50 for the warframe and a few weapons added to it or just buy weapons for about 25 dollars somehow the game even manages to make boss battles a repetive grind with for instance the jackal just constantly avoiding missiles and shooting the legs or stabbing them to death if you enjoy melee and then dammaging him parkour while featured in the game is clunky and glitchy which can end in you accidently launching yourself 25 feet into the air by attempting to run up a wall and jump another interesting thing is that in the kubrow quest a glitch can happen where you have to leave and reenter the game just to instal the compoment you earned from one part of the quest just so you can actually instal it the most fun i had in this game is actually just killing minor units mowing down grineer corpus and the infected is hug amounts of fun but can easily get boring due to the repetitive grindy nature of the game i personally feel like the game is more of a money making scheme than an actual fully fledged game due to the fact that its an insane grind for weapons and warframes yet every item in the game can be bought for real money although it is highly expensive a good example of this too is the clan dojo in which you have to run missions to get one time run missions to get a chance to get a blueprint which then in turn requires a ton of materials and credits to craft and then takes forever to actually finish crafting to just add a room to your dojo note your dojo also needs energy rooms and hallways just for it to function correctly or you can just circumvent this process and buy a forma the item needed for the dojo room for ten bucks all in all this game is fun in short brief sessions and if you just do not care about having alot of items or variety but i personally do not recommend this game the weapons are fun to use though

the gameplay was extremely linear the missions were buggy and to make it worse the storyline is literally just a whole concoction of player theories who have pieced together what they heard from enemies what we were told and lotus unless atleast the gameplay is fixed for me i dont recomend this game
not recommended
where to start with this one well first off i like the ghrapics the gameplay and the abilities however after a couple hours of playing i noticed that the enemies started doing way more damage and i was doing roughly the same as i started out so i decided to look for a new stronger weapon i find out that you cant buy a weapon thats better using the in game credits oh no you have to buy the currency using real money in order to get a decent weapon its that or you can do the facebook style of upgrading buy the blue print play a level a half dozen times to find a resource and then hopefully after a day of grinding you have what you need did i mention the fact you cant kill the enemies even on the first level anymore because their difficulty progressed with you >> so good luck getting those resources yet another potentially great game turned to  from greed i would have much rather paid 5060 bucks for the game and the ability to progress with ingame credits that i didnt have to buy versus having to buy 20 dollars worth of game money for a single weapon really as for those of you who fell victim to that and want to hold onto that pride so to speak of this being a great game it is sure but only for about 45 minutes
not recommended
the game is very repetetive and after youve gone through the first 2 planet maps you will have seen basically everything the game has to offer new content is added every month or so but unfortunately not enough is changing to keep me playing i want to like this game but it is too gear based vs skill based

i got a problem when i went to pruchase platinum fron the market with a 20% discount that i got from a log in reward so as i said i got the 20% discount and i went trough the process of payment and everything like ive done before but this time something happened that when i added funds to my steam wallet the game registered the purchase but it hasnt charged my bank account or my steam wallet and i havent got my platinum after the purchase i checked my steam wallet and it still shows that the money for the purchase is still there and on the history on my bank account it says that the transaction is peanding after a while when ive purchased platinum before i always receive it when i get back to the game but this time it did not happen and i really hope that this can be fixed because i look at the purchase platinum tab on the games market and it says that i have the discount but when i click on it the deals show that i dont have any discount so yeah im pretty much  that i have not received my platinum and lost the discount anyone that can help me with this ill appreciate it

this game could be fun for those who would enjoy a good game with good mechanics and of course the online multiplayer aspect as a gamer i enjoyed this game imensely too begin with as a school student who works hard and studies after school i could not play this game everyday and this is why i dont like this game because it demands attention on a regular basis to grind for resources i don not have the time while my friends do along with the fact you need to pay for wepons slots which my friends did they poured hours off there life over 500 hours to get these elusive weapons that they refused to pay for i can no longer play with them nor will i be able to catch up unless i pay money these games suck because they require some money to have fun and can not be played by the caual gamer like me if its your thing to spend all this time then enjoy but if you dont have the time to commit then dont bother

quite fun to play but too repetitive the first few hours of playing you really enjoy it but as you get into the 50100 hour range farming becomes 75% of what you do in the game there is no such thing as a story in this game no matter how many updates try to add lore now that all the new weapons require a clan research lab the weapons before it researched the lab resources to be researched massive build times for all these items it can take literally months to get a new weapon if you have a decent amount of clan members to help not to mention that there are research weapons that are absolute trash

warframe is a fun diversion for a few hours however there are several flaws that keep this game from becoming more than just a novelty for starters the game handles quite well combat is satisfying and the controls are responsive however very little outside of the basic game mechanics are explained things like crafting and progression are completely devoid of any meaningful explanation i spent a few hours trying to figure out how to acquire a better weapon than the starter rifle i ended up buying a blue print which appears to be completely unusable until much more progression this seems to stress the microtransaction aspect of the game as its probably just easier to buy things than try to figure out how to craft them anyways it was fun for a few hours cant say ill play again good visuals good gameplay but if you arent sold on the idea of shelling out money towards this game i can only imagine that itll be worth a few hours of your time

while a lot of effort has been put into this game and the polish is commendable the further this game hase gone into development the more and more obtuse the entire thing has become this game has all the markings of a aaa title both for good and bad except that its f2p and still technically in development which gives us gorgeous uis that actually make it difficult to do what youd like the damage system used to be fairly simply if not obfuscated but now it requires a degree of research to even come to terms with bleeding applies through your shields normal attacks have status elements with combinations the initial ambition of this project has begun to exceed itself

just as a review of the first 60 minutes or so of gameplay ive had the worst experience with this game than i have with any other in the past few months being as it relies on internet connection the connection cut out during the tutorial not once but twice after completing the tutorial finally i was taken to a loading screen where it simply stopped loading three times and stayed at the same load point for an additional 30 minutes before i gave up and closed the game i went through the intro cutscene and tutorial stage 5 times before giving up on this game entirely as far as merits go what little gameplay i had was entertaining after adjusting the graphic settings after the lagfest of the first intro cutscene the weapons were pretty neat and the attacking felt fluid i enjoyed the aesthetic qualities of the game the design of the enemies and armor were pretty darn cool as well but thats as far as the good qualities go the only thing holding me back from reccommending this game is the constant disconnects having to do the tutorial and watch an unskippable cutscene over and over again i can practically quote half of the dialogue from the tutorial i understand that while this is not the intended experience of the game its what ive experienced after googling the issue ive tried nearly every remedy listed and nothing has worked as far as i can tell if you want to play this game dont play it over steam get it from the website where you are taken to create an account anyways

as fun as the gameplay is the ammount of grinding that you need to do is pretty hilarious and feels unecessary sure you have groups of people playing with you but with ranking up and crafting being timegated it sometimes feel like youre grinding just for the sake of grinding it just feelsnot worth it at times

at first warframe appears to be something new and origional with its spectacular art style and graphics and its entire presentation is a feast for the eyes however after a few hours of gameplay grinding the same spots for the blueprients and materials to create the warframe or weapon you wanted you will wonder to yourself what now do you grind for more gear get some more fancy augments but whats the point when all your fancy warframes and weapons only make you more efficient at grinding for more stuff now i know what youre saying isnt that the basis of any mmo sort off if you boil it down any mmo is one big quest for loot but what makes it good is how fun it is to play all the dungeons and missions to recieve these rewards and warframe fails it it terribly this game becomes far too repetitive you only have a handful of scenarios to play through on missions and the difference between them is barely remarkable youre still fighting baddies through the same spaceship hallways just rearranged each time the warframes themselves are also fundamentally flawed each warframe has a unique set of abilities which three are avaliable from the start and the last only ebing avaliable when your wf is upgraded with an item that is conveniently found in the cash shop sure but you also have a rather limited pool of energy that you expend to use said abilities and said pool can only be replenished by scarce pickups so really yuor style is more defined by what wepaons you have painstakenly constructed by grinding for the materials to make and if you dont like them youre  out of luck not to mention the fact that there is little to no emphasis on teamwork on a multiplayer game i mean they try to do something by making each warframes abilities varied enough to try and do so but if youre not sprinting down a hallway and killing things fast then you end up being more of a burden t the team same thing applies to pvp nothing matters but outright damage and you better built the right warframe for it or its back to more grinding for you then there is the cash shop while every weapon and frame can be built from materials and blueprints dropped in missions which takes ages of grinding you can instantly buy them in the cash shop as well this screams play to win in the most blatant way but since grinding for your equipment is half the game youll probably come to the conclusion that this isnt worth the time faster if you spend a few bucks so despite its flashy looks and first impressions warframe is a huge dissapointment dont get me wrong i wanted this game to be good so badly its an absolute delight to look at and the setting alone is quite good how could you not enjoy what is essentialy a story revolving around an ancient race of alien space ninja but sadly the core gameplay mechanics fall short in what is a flawed game everything is so polished i can see someone forgetting that theyve been running through what is basically the same randomized space ship for hours to find the last few materials for their lazer katana that burns things that it slices through if only art direction could float a game on its own but i suppose if youre going to grind through the same spots for a while they might as well look pretty

i was enjoying the game it is hard to really aquire anything outside of your starters without either grinding for gear and parts for hours and or just spending money i had put enough time to pretty much max my orignal tenno when i got banned for no reason all was said was i some how violated the eula when i have done nothing wrong in my knowledge i contacted support and said after manual review i did indeed do something to do such was not told what still and said ban could not be lifted glad i never wasted my money on this at this point i will not recommend anygame that bans players without a reasonable explination and violating the eula is not reasonable

where to start with this one well first off i like the ghrapics the gameplay and the abilities however after a couple hours of playing i noticed that the enemies started doing way more damage and i was doing roughly the same as i started out so i decided to look for a new stronger weapon i find out that you cant buy a weapon thats better using the in game credits oh no you have to buy the currency using real money in order to get a decent weapon its that or you can do the facebook style of upgrading buy the blue print play a level a half dozen times to find a resource and then hopefully after a day of grinding you have what you need did i mention the fact you cant kill the enemies even on the first level anymore because their difficulty progressed with you >> so good luck getting those resources yet another potentially great game turned to  from greed i would have much rather paid 5060 bucks for the game and the ability to progress with ingame credits that i didnt have to buy versus having to buy 20 dollars worth of game money for a single weapon really as for those of you who fell victim to that and want to hold onto that pride so to speak of this being a great game it is sure but only for about 45 minutes

the game is very repetetive and after youve gone through the first 2 planet maps you will have seen basically everything the game has to offer new content is added every month or so but unfortunately not enough is changing to keep me playing i want to like this game but it is too gear based vs skill based

i got a problem when i went to pruchase platinum fron the market with a 20% discount that i got from a log in reward so as i said i got the 20% discount and i went trough the process of payment and everything like ive done before but this time something happened that when i added funds to my steam wallet the game registered the purchase but it hasnt charged my bank account or my steam wallet and i havent got my platinum after the purchase i checked my steam wallet and it still shows that the money for the purchase is still there and on the history on my bank account it says that the transaction is peanding after a while when ive purchased platinum before i always receive it when i get back to the game but this time it did not happen and i really hope that this can be fixed because i look at the purchase platinum tab on the games market and it says that i have the discount but when i click on it the deals show that i dont have any discount so yeah im pretty much  that i have not received my platinum and lost the discount anyone that can help me with this ill appreciate it

it is horrible over all 110 at first i was like this is an alright game 610 feeling so far then you get past noob level and the gunskincrafting info is foundshown little uninformative to a new player 3 forms of money and its bottom 510 then you learn that the character levels but you have to do a training mission thing to level you go in there and they do not tell you sht and put you in a circle and then have a ton of enemy spawn in an unrealistic realm worst of all if you fail you have to wait 24 hours to retry even worse still when i got level 1 it said i had to wait like 5 hours to do the training mission what why the duck 110 over all it is a 110 most games i either tell friends it is awesome and they should play it it has good aspects but i can not recommend its okay im not a big fan or i do not like it but this game i might actually tell my friends that it is a bad game and they should not even trial play it ever pretty much burn it with fire dr jackel mr hyde for the nes is a better game lol

is the gameplay good i honestly have no idea i played the game a while ago and really enjoyed it i decided to get it on steam however when i did this there was a massive camera glitch in the missions the missionworld select screen worked perfectly however the cmera glitched out and i just saw a mesh of green colours i asked in the chat for help and it was full of unsociable and a trolly community i looked through a help section and again had no help maybe if this was sorted out i could have recommended the game but its simply buggy the new patches havent fixed the bug so i guess i just have to do something else until then

my friends have been going on and on about this game for a little over a year now and so i thought id try it out no thanks its really dry maps feel cramped it just doesnt seem to move well to me if youre heavier into 3rd person shooters id say go for it but i feel like it was laggy and not worth the space on my hard drive
not recommended
its a simple 3rd person shooter that feels like youre playing by yourself even when you arent i got on and played a round alone and it was just lacking something but it was alright then i tried out the online game play and this is where i would take a few things into consideration before using up hard drive space the idea of the game after reading up is that every unit is individual and contributes to the larger team effort in a unique way great concept however it falls so flat that one might believe that it was tossed off the top of the empire state building it turns into a run and outgun frag fest where all you end up doing if trying to get the most kills and score the most loot while leaving everyone else behind the exp has nothing to do with team preformance or teamwork and instead only values the indiviual thus turning what could be a great teamwork experience into super mario party with guns

this game has a verry basic tutorial that only teaches you how to swap wepons move and so on but the game has allot of features that it pretty much just throws at you like they are simple and easy to use but they arent also the game is more like a store than a game virtually all of the wepons and warframes will cost you real money

the premise of the game is a little odd and the plot is well dry boring and best ignored unless you like obscure and wierd space drama so moving on the game play has alot of innovative ideas poorly implemented so lets start with the big elephant in the room the free to play set up of the game is a pharce without spending real money on platinum or items you are at a huge disadvantage gear  experience and money come slow grinding not a little slow but insanely slow two weeks of playtime my gear is all around level 10 and everyone keeps telling me it gets better so why suffer through crappy game play to get to end game content that once again favors people who are willing to dump real money in the game ahh spend money yourself you say well heres my counter when you swing weapons they follow a static path much like an old style mortal kombat game meaning things like hills or rocks or a slight incline will cause your melee weapon to whiff secondly try wall running or duck jumping again confounded by terrair rocks poor control and slight inclines and finally the deal breaker  mission types certain missions like say the spy missions  wretched at best where one twitchy mob or missclick causes mission failure now throw into that ability missfires and buggy mobs are just part of the game im not talking about stuff that you can compensate with skill over im talking about the game randomly screwing you because of crappy code hmm i shot the dude on the alarm yet he triggered it after he died well balls or my favorite running an extermination mission and the wildlife attacks him and knocks him into terrain making it impossible for me to complete the mission and my final beef with the game is its revive system limited revives that you have to spend real money on to refresh or you fail on missions because youre out of revives when your randomly screwed over with a bug deal breaker this game should not be played by anyone unless this sort of half arsed game design is your niche

grind so you can get more equipment to grind in level design that rivals halo 1 in terms of most amount of copypasting its got better polish than your average f2p game the content is pretty expensive and also subjectively pay 2 win because path of exile or dota 2 could have done the same thing poe could have charged for uniques and dota for hero unlocks except they only charge for cosmetics path of exile is a coop pve game too in warframe you either cough up the cash or spend eternity grinding to grind some more its pretty much single player because theres no communication and most players tend to just hit the sprint  crouch button to reach the objective rather than collecting resources you are forced to chase them as they reach the only coop feature of the game where two players are need to hit a switch together to open a door here is a quick explaination of the gameplay you have an overview of our solar system you start at mercury each planet has a particular amount of missions before you proceed to the next planet planets also consist of resources which drop from killed enemies or cratesstorage in a nutshell you do coop missions which are bland grind items credit and resources purchase blueprints with the virtual credit each item requires certain resources for the sake of this review lets say i want to craft a rhino warframe it requires w x y z resources refer to the solar system map and see which planet has those resources now mercury will have z jupiter has y and pluto has w you will have to play missions even repeat them to aquire the neccessary resources once you do gather the resources you have to wait 1224 hours in real time for the foundry to craft the weapon this is nothing more than a way to nudge you reminding you that the game is free to play with inconvienience free to play really is a tainted model unless its path of exile and dota 2 and loadout where it actually works i rather cough up 2949$ to play a full experience all hostility aside the game has potential and digital extremes is a talented company considering they did ut1999 03 04 and dark sector the controls and graphics are fantastic get rid of the buy to unlock model and look at path of exiles as a blue print also for those who are complaining about wasting money on this game to only be dissapointed 2030 hours later its not the developers fault its the risk you take when you decide to invest in open betas and f2p give this game a try or try its prequel single player dark sector which was an underrated game by digital extreme

ive bought this game for many years and think this might be my last firstly im not keen on spending 30 a year on something that could be released as an update the lack of competition in the manager genre has made si very lazy to the point where they make one or two small changes and market it as a new game here are some of the points where my problems lie ridiculous injurys in my first season there was not one point where i didnt have at least six players injured how many times in real football does a team make all its subs then a player gets injured and they finish the game with 10 men well in fm about one in three games but amazingly never to the computer opponent its almost impossible to generate any momentum anymore in fm you will be playing well then suddenly lose for no reason football has always been in the headlines for footballers astronomical wages thank god its not like fm youth players who have never made a first team appearance asking for 40k agents of average players asking for 5mill in fees instead of improving things like the ability to see how your players have performed in training during the week to help your decisions on who to play si add tunnel interviews i can imagine the meeting at si so what have the fans on the forums been asking for well their all desperate for more press interviews in the game they just dont feel theres enough as fans of the series we should treat si like an alchoholic relative and not hand over money to them to continue their bad habits in this case their bad habits being treating fans like cashcows that they can just make substandard games for and rely on fan loyalty

i have played every iteration of the football manager series long before i even used steam and i have to say that football manager 2015 has some of the most glaring issues i have seen within the series manager customization has been inserted and is a step in the right direction but not entirely so you will get to customize the stats of your manager are you more laid back or more technical the option to customize and edit stats as such as adaptability and understand of things like attacking defensive etc are there however i dont entirely know what impact they have on the game as in my 9 hours of playing i havent really noticed it or came across them again i also do not know if these stats improve or worsen over time depending on what you do  as the game does not tell you even in the very brief tutorials the new user interface layout is amazing and is long overdue i actually found that i stopped playing football manager 2014 because of the ui it was clunky it was a mess and i had no idea where anything was it was all just text and drop down menus now there is a nice sidebar which provides links that take you to the most important and most used parts of the game as such as tactics scouting team etc purchasing players is odd this year sometimes it is extremely easy to buy a player and others extremely difficult for no reason  even if you are trying to purchase an already transfer listed player or a reserve player getting no games at his current club the old let me pay 100m on a 48 month deal still works you can buy any player that wants to come to your club if you use this method and it totally breaks the entire game my biggest gripe and the sole reason why i need to give a bad recommendation to this game the ai and the match engine the ai in football manager 2015 is the worst i have ever seen in the series if you actually sit and watch the match unfold you will see some of the following  players running for a ball and stopping for no reason  the goalkeeper saving the ball standing back and staring at the ball which is touching his feet  a player will chase the ball down the wing at full speed slow down and allow a opposing team player to catch up and take the ball  opposing team player has the ball and stands still all of your players are polite enough to let him stand still  outrages tackles ball is moving out of your box opposing striker is running out of your box there is no threat defender will slide tackle him as he is leaving the box and give away a penalty  cbs that seem to play as strikers leaving entire gaps in your defence red cards injuries and own goals  everywhere i have not went through a game yet where there has not been at least one own goal either by my team or the opposing team they are everywhere red cards and injuries happen in abundance  i have had 10 players injured within the first month of a season even though i had average training and not too many games in quick succession tactics do not work as they are intended if you sit down and take the time to read and learn how to create tactics you will be so frustrated the game gives you descriptions of what each position and instruction does in depth this is great however they do not work as they say short passing retaining position and not punting the ball up the park team constantly just fires the ball all over the park with next to no short passing push higher up the park team sits deep because of these issues scorelines can be ridiculous in my first 5 games of the season there was a combined number of 30 goals between me and the other team my first game finished 54 and my second was 63 this all leads to a very frustrating experience overall every year si always say we are improving the match engine where are these improvements i have not seen any improvements just more bugs and terrible ai i love this series and i am a huge football fan but i feel obliged to tell fellow consumers not to purchase this product until it vastly improves

finally i am starting to fall out of love with this game just too many issues and it appears im not the only one to mention in one review so i will list my biggest bugbears  injuries  like many others each save game has been dominated with injuries fm liverpool fmc liverpool fm custom of course many players get injured but i have rarely managed to field an entire matchday squad without bringing in 23 reserve and youth players this means on average i have about 8 senior players injured 68 weeks is the most common length  training  there just seems to be no improvement on this side of things it is embarrassing that you can only train your whole team as one for example  attacking training there is not one professional team that have all their players do the same group training schemes why would i want the likes of skrtel toure and sakho doing attacking training the majority of the time it is just lazy game designing on top of this there appears to be a bug that a few players in your team are always upset about the high training workload  no matter what you try to fix it  talking to players  again it feels like this is a bit on the weak side you only have the same options available sure you can try to convince players but only with intangible promises  eg promise to bring in high profile players but with no obvious way to figure out if the player you buy is going to appease the player  everything is short term  this is my plan for this season  most clubs have a 3 or 5 year plan you should be able to lay out your plans for your contract entirety  eg have more money in the first year to build a squad that will develop or lay away your transfer kitty for later seasons because the squad you have now will get you promoted etc  teams still wont bid for new players or contract signees  it is very frustrating to buy a kid for the future and have to wait 6 months to loan him out tactics are inflexible  rarely does it work if you want to play a fast short game or a slow direct game this is nothing like real life remember liverpool last season or stoke every season plus they still havent brought back player runs  a huge miss for tactical control the biggest problem matchday  i watch it on 2d to try and avoid some of the bugs but a lot of them still persist the two most common are players not chasing down a loose ball 5 yards away from them and the worst one of allopponent takes a shot kepper makes a save ball comes back into the penalty box keeper watches it for 5 minutes whilst the opponent runs 25 yards to stick it in the back of the netfunny thing is it only happens to your keeper plus the tactics you use dont have a big effect on the game i tested this out by doing the old saverestart cheat against west brom at home tried 442451433 with different player combinations and tacticseach time lost 21 or 20 on the plus side it looks prettier unfortunately as most people point out there is no motivation for miles and the si team to make real improvements each year we will shell out 30 and receive some old rope in return at least now you can play the beta access and get bored of the game before its official release date if you would like to play alternative manager games i recommend fm11 and premier manager 97 those games felt like the developers cared

oh boy where to start the pros the game is so indepth detailed and looks great that at first glance you feel like you are in heaven unfortunately the absolutely ridiculous ai and randomness of the game ruins it for brand new players and seasoned veterans alike very quickly i have played football manager games since the 1990s i have bought every game in this football manager series i have probably tens of thousands of hours of experience playing these and have thoroughly enjoyed every fm yet until this fiasco i have only played this one with two teams man united and sheffield united but the experience has been identical the game is so damn unrealistic that it will suck the life out of you these are actual situations that happened in my season with man united a month into the season i have lost nearly third of my team to long injuries some players cannot put together two games in a row before returning to the injury list not totally out of the question but highly unlikely queens park rangers finished 2nd in the epl in my first season while tottenham and liverpool barely missed relegation i finished 9th and got fired i kept beating the top teams repeatedly while collapsing at home 05 to teams like qpr and swansea i lost 50 to a 9man manchester city after winning the shots 145 and hitting the postcrossbar five times frustrating but not impossible but scenarios like this unfold throughout the season the likes of rooney and mata cannot score regardless of opposition or their position on the field while james wilson bangs out a 30goal campaign you can literally have a guy of van persies stature standing on the 6yd line with an empty net and hit the post over and over again and dont even get me started on these phantom goalies you can be playing against a backup to the backup goalie 2 divisions below yours and fail to score while the opposition sinks 3 behind de gea on three shots i scored 2 or 3 goals from direct free kicks all season and maybe twice from a corner my opponents you got it somewhere around dozens now it might sound like im making excuses and dont know how to manage but as i said i have enjoyed these types of games some 20 years whether i win or lose why because the games have been as fair and realistic as a simulations sports game can be sure there will always be that crazy 75 home win against some world class team but when it happens once every 150 games or so thats pretty okay there will always be that game where an underdog takes you down and leaves you extremely frustrated but guess what it actually happens what doesnt happen are the scenarios i discussed above and after some 150 hours into fm 2015 i feel like i have enough personal experience to call this game total garbage fortunately fm 2013 and fm 2014 are still installed on my computer and still offer limitless hours of fun and entertainment do not waste your money on this game play the older installations and wait until sports interactive gets their crap straight a major major disappointment

pros love the new layout and skin communication with players is better than ever love the new options in transfer and contract negotiations cons way too easy to sign top players and the 48 month payment options are pretty broken they should take more out of your budget for them since at the moment you can spend 100m on a 25m budget match engine is terrible best way to win is by playing like big sam hoof it up to the wingers and have a big man in the middle keepers are also terrible constantly fumbling into the path of oncoming strikers getting caught in posession and passing to the opponent defenders cant mark in the box and miss free headers constantly i would say 34 of all goals come from a cross or a keeper  defender doing something shambolic overall great new features coming at the expense of all the simple things if they fix the match engine then this could be a very good installment currently 410 if patched 910

si seriously need to listen to the players more the match engine hasnt been good for years players are easily unsettled if they dont play games due to injury they want to leave for more football the new promises feature would have been amazing if you werent forced into making promises the game doesnt even allow you to keep some promises i had a player wanting to go out on loan i made th effort and he rejected all the loan offers a month later he wants to leave the latest update was pointless in my opinion the whole point of a hotfix update is to address specific problems but all i have noticed is a couple match engine tweaks and the other obvious ones stated on the change list there are still many problems in the game so they might has well have fixed them all and make one big update this games not even been out a month yet and its still not fixed im just playing the game waiting for the next update and when it comes im waiting for another update the same thing happened with fm14 the game was only playable after the update in april and by that time i got bored of the game please dont make us wait until april again for this game to be playable

not saying this is a bad game not at all i have played football manager since 2012 and know the game in and out now this is the most fun football manager but is the most fake as in a season only having one 00 game where i play defence with counter attack still does make for an interesting season having 127 goals and 58 conceded is interesting to watch as well do not get me wrong but this is the most unrealistic football manager they have put out its a joke how many goals go in and how much is just plain unrealistic example first game in the prem just got middlesbrough promoted playing against liverpool games ends 86  86  how does that happen if you want an unreal intense football manager where it is all goals goals goals then this is for you if you want a football manager go and play the last year and just download a mod that updates teams for you because this is not a football manager pros   a lot of goals  never a dull game  more indepth communication with player and staff  in match team talks  better transfer and overall balancing  always fun most game end with a min of 3 goals  more goals goals  goals for every one  being able to speak to a player who does not want to come instead of being blocked by agent gives more scope to get players out of your range cons   very unrealistic  random injurie spells not always but can end up having 9 players out for 3 weeks after 2 games and two weeks of training so always save and quit when this starts as when it does the injuries will not stop until you cannot field a team  no matter strategy you will score a lot and concede a lot  could still have more depth i still think it has got too streamlined from 2012  players seems to get very unhappy fast and all seem to being a stubborn as a mule unless you use the talk  x player is having good form no matter the form they seem to agree with you  having a one 00 in a hole season and 3 strikers with more than 20 goals and top 6 goals scores in the league all having more the 30 goals kind of makes it seem very unrealistic  german league rights have gone and still no badges for most top flights teams  mods do fix both mind overall for people wanting fun 710 people wanting a football manager 310

i love football manager but they really messed up with this version the transfer screen is a mess and it is hard to find new players everything has been hiden in strange menues and wen you finally find the thing you want to do you cant remember where you found it the live game is like watching a game with kids it is not uncommen to see 89 players in a small area and noone can hit the ball the keeper has two settings catch every ball or drop everything it is not uncommen to see your keeper jumping high and it takes forever to hit the ground again that makes it so easy for the attackers to score it is not a bug its a feature dont get me started with the freekicks if your player has a higher rating then 1 i freeking you will score if it is nearer then 90 meters from the goal oh i forgot about the demands from the players i played my first season as brndby and 8 eight ing players demanden to be sold that was devestating for the morale of the team but come on i cannot sell 8 players in one transfer period at the end of every season do some different players demand to get sold and they get angry and so do the rest of the guys if you do not let them accept an offer not just any offer ooooh no but a offer from the last transfer period that is just plain stupid you cannot sell a player in a closed marked the game sucks bigtime it is harder then ever so even if you plays manchester united against bradford you still are up for a huge chalenge dont buy this game its a mess and not worth the money stay with fm14 i know i will undtil most of the bugs are fixed httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvafunukqvity

first of all id like to say ive been a football manager fan for many years now dating back to the late nineties and the good old days of championship manager i havent played much of the game thus far so this mini review is based on my early experiences i was looking forward to this years release hoping it would be a massive improvement on last years title unfortunatly this isnt the case all the things i hated about fm14 are still very much present in fm15 and much more personally when i play the game i like to take control of a small team and work my way up the career ladder rather than taking control over a ready made team such as barcelona or real madrid for example now i understand when playing in the lower leagues the game difficulty is increased and as the player you need to be more mind full of this the the fact of the matter is in fm15 it is impossible to build a team from scratch unless of course you cheat or have a ridiculous amount of spare time and no i dont want to play classic mode player wages and contract renewals are a joke the demands of players at the lower league level are just unfair resulting in the player leaving on a free and subsequently joining another team at the same level but for lower wages it honestly has me pulling my hair out at times players would also choose retirement form football all together over playing for a small team on low wages surley a footballer would want to get his career back on track and get himself in the shop window everyones a winner the club could get some much needed investment through a big transfer sale and the player is back playing pro football i mean cmon whats the point just so the game can make room for the thousands of pointless 15 year old regensdoesnt include under 18 squads that will never play a competive matchever not that youll know how good they are anyway seen as scouting takes forever and when they do return with a report the attributes are all ranged for instance pace could be between 8 and 15 now in theroy i do like this idea it makes sense and encourages the player to make the most of the scouts at his or her disposal in pratice it sucks big time to many numbers wedged into a small box not a good design and again just adds to the confusion with that in mind i recommend ticking the dissable attribute masking box upon starting a new game you will still find ways to utilise the scouts the match engine once again is so so poor trust me im not being over critical just honest but if you like seeing burger vans outside the staduim youll probably love it even if you are losing 60 and every goal has contradicted your tactics in every possible way a tactic i might add that you spent hours on before hand tactics have become confusing how on earth fm can attract new players to the franchise is beyond me the game offers no help whatsoever to the first time player and a guide showing you around the new skin just doesnt cut it even a experienced player note not good ha ha such as myself have felt a little out of my depth and i have felt on a few occasions unsure on what i can actually do to stop a losing run or how to tighen up a leeky defense hell im unsure at times what exactly it is im doing right when im winning the point is my back room staff need to contribute more telling me to close down a player isnt always enough tell me who would be best to use to close a player down stuff like that player instructions just dont work half the time you concentrate on a certain asspect of the team and the game will punish you in other areas if you dont want to lose the shape of your team defensivley and as such instruct the team to close down less the ai simply score a high amount of goals from outside the box reguardless of the goal scorers long shot attribute or the ball would be given away in a dangerous area like a horrendous back pass etc its like the ai gets the hump when you out smart it fm has lost its spark there is no fun in playing anymore its like it has forgotten what it is and that quiet simply is a computer game nothing more nothing less its gotten far to serious for its own good the days of winning the champions league with dag&red are all but gone i have put in roughly 1112 hours into my first save and im half way through my first season having won only 2 games i feel right now like unistalling and going back to fm 13 or even 12 im not saying dont buy this game but i am saying to be mindful you could find yourself shouting at your computer screen a little more than usual things will get broken trust me but i suppose thats what fm is all about right real football mangers get stressed so it makes sense for the most realistic football management simulator for follow suit correct im sure there are alot of good things about fm15 and maybe my tactics and team selection were crap however having just lost 65 to 10 men barrow the bad outweighs the good its a real shame but i truely feel fm has gone down the same road as fifa where the only real change to the game are the updated summer transfers and im gutted i really am

ridiculous match engine which sees many matches end 44 64 55 etc you will go 30 up and use containing tactics to protect your lead only to conceed 5 second half goals and lose 35 ive already had 3 goals scored from attacking teams own half ie 6070 yard strikes most goals come from rebounds from the keeper or the woodwork its all just a bit broken i have been playing football manager since its amiga championship manager days and this has to be the worst effort yet i usually wait for these titles to go on sale but bought this one at full price eager to get hold of my teams watford potential promotion winning squad never again will i pay full price for a football manager game very disappointed i am sure future patches will address some of these issues but they never should have released an unfinished unbalanced game

an important public service announcement do not i repeat do not buy this ing piece of utter horse  under any i repeat any circumstances the match engine is ed beyond all recognition it will drive you insane thinking that the game is scripted but it honestly is not it is just so ineptly designed that even now after years of releasing these games defenders will still trap the ball then run away from it allowing the opposition free goals why is this happening laziness and complacency on the part of the developers do not spend your money on this ing shithouse unless you feel justified in feeding their evil empire i found out the hard way you have been warned

tldr  worst game in the series bar none what an fing disgrace actual review  many game companies fall into the habit of getting caught up in the new features each iteration of their game come out with while neglecting the problems inherent in the core game itself we get it its hard to sell a game to new customers if the biggest thing you can advertise is we toyed with the balancing all year or we sorted out all the issues with the code fm unfortunatly has fallen into just that trap anyone who has played the past several years of fm can tell you that while many new features have been added they have by and large slapped onto a  foundation of code that struggled under the weight of a match engine it could not adequately support watching your 30 million pound striker send a suicide mans backpass to the keeper from an attacking postion wingers shooting at impossible angles on goals keepers booting the ball off their own players and into the goal and so on any person with a shred of computer programming literacy could tell you that what si needed to do was go back to square one instead si made the mind numbingly awful decission to slap a brand new considerably more complicated match engine on top of their  code and had the gall to advertise it as a completely new product low and behold you have one of the worst footy simulators to have graced this earth it colapses under it own weight with comical regularity just watch your players freeze on the pitch for no reason like someone turned the power off no patch is gonna be able to polish this turd id suggest buying an older more stable version if you have to have your fix but then youd be supporting these crooks

i love the football manager series this game has potential but it has some serious teething issues and needs updated the high score lines and players getting injured every game is very unrealistic and not up to usual standard ive been playing fm since the start and was put off by the mix reviews on here but decided to try it for myself  i dont understand how people can honestly enjoy or reccommend this game in its current state pros looks good and performance is fast new interface is good and easy to use once you get used to it scouting has been improved cons far too many injuries at least one per game leading to a selection crisis no matter what team or league i pick far too many high score lines 44 64 75  43  even against lower league teams goal keepers are slow to get up after a save defending is poornon existent no matter what team or tactics you deploy  i have yet to keep a clean sheet far too many goals from long range against you far too many goals conceded from crosses one game with everton vs new england revelation i had 30 shots on target and scored 2 goals they had 6 and they beat me 62 its not very realistic and what i expect from a football manager game  i can put up with the high scorelines but the constant injuries is infuriating no matter what team or league or the set up in training etc  even the reserves seem to pick up injuries  you shouldnt have a selection headache due to injury a few games into the season it has potential but im only a few hours in and these issues have put me off i expected to be lost in the game and have 20 plus hours gameplay by now i simply cannot reccomend this until they address the issues

as much as i love the franchise and the previous releases this one just doesnt do it for me its a horrible game atm realism non existing its basically fm14 with a sidebar more time wasted on annoying interviews and an if you can belive it even worse match engine the worst one so far in any fm game imo it has the potential to become a great game but it needs so so so much work that i dont think si will be able to pull it off before the release of fm16 im not going to recommend this game right now but if there is a god then it might be worth it to check back in 2 or 3 months to see if anything has improved cheers

i have been playing football manager for years and so far this is worst manager ever just some facts out of my head  injuries seriously so many of them and every one must be for few months and if it is in game it is always after you already have made all three substitutions  transfers look out a bit in real world players in lower leagues or in clubs with budget troubles do not ask monstruous amounts of money for their players and you dont pay player worth 50k more than 500k but in this manager you pay it for more than 5m  players atributes i wasnt sure before but i am now they are crap in my team i have strikers with amazing attributes for strikers and hey cant score if their life depend on it but on the other side strikers in other teams with crappy attributes score 20 goals in season like they play in minor league  interviews if i wanted to read that much and respond to all those questions i would buy a book or go to online chat and not waste money on this game i feel like i am playing celebrity manager instead football  ai now this is special story in last manager it was bad bit it was managable in this on it is so bad that i want to ask for refund of my money examples you are playing great in first half then in secon without any reason you just start playing like local division club and easily loose by few goals whenever you play agains favorites your players get injured early in start of match or you get red card or penylty is awarded against you same goes when some favorite is playing bad in season dont wory they will bounce back to winning agains you then there is unreal match chances like in first 5 minutes your opponent have 10 chances in order for you to score you need 10 on target shots while your opponents need 2 or 3 or how often happenes when you ar strong favorite that other time outplays you on home game with 3040 chances agains you in this managet that is every other game i am curious has ever any of the guys that developed this  of ai watched a real football game

i have played every version of this game since it came out like any crack addict i was compelled to buy knowing the risks hell i even upgraded my pc just so i could play the game properly because the last two incarnations just wouldnt work on my battered old machine there are always problems when it first comes out ive found that the problems persist until a patch comes out in decemberjanuary now for the breakdown good  the user interface is so much better there is more interaction with players you can force moves out with a gentle discussion  a great innovation bad  whats going on with the tactics i was scoring plenty of goals but i noticed that i was conceding far too many maybe it was my tactical setup so when i went into a 30 lead i decided to shore up my defence i dropped my defenders back and even my wingers yet once again i was conceding the same sort of goals  a cross into the box and finished because my full back was somewhere else or more usually the goalie making a save and the rebound always falling to their striker the end result was 43 my stats showed i had the tallest team in the league and thus scored most from corners however i also conceded the most from corners wtf i developed one tactic where i gave up trying to win away and just park a bus still a 52 thrashing i won the league scoring over 100 goals i conceded more than the relegated teams 70 despite brilliant fitness coaches i was losing to loads of last minute goals why god why i love this game and always will but to get most enjoyment ill wait until the patch

update 3182015 logged in to try the update for a while and had this experience spent hours refining tactics in preseason games getting everything just right spent a lot of time working on training regimens to make sure the historically injury prone have slightly less intense work outs spent hours working my scouts to death got near the start of the season and had some great transfers lined up to come in wanyama tielemans depay and a few other youngins a net spend sure but after negotiating hard deals for kaboul capoue and adebayor i was well within the transfer budget we are go for launch a few days after the deals were agreed but before the players came to terms what happens kaboul our 4 weeks capoue broken for 3 months in training the deals are off and i have not saved for hours i swear to god they made injuries a problem so you have to buy the editor ill need to see stellar reviews for any future version before i pay again what an absolute heartbreaking shame there used to be a game here update 1242015 i still dont recommend this game i do recommend this series nothing else compares to fm there isnt a single sports management simulation in all of video games that comes close to how well fm does what it idoes if you are a new player get fm14 itll be cheaper and you dont have to pay full price for fm15 to get up to date rosters search the community hub and google for player and team updates and how to install them again if you are on the fence get fm14 its super good original review ive averaged about 650700 hours in each years fm dating back to 2011 ill keep this short there are great improvements to this game i just wish i could get to them every game i start no matter the team no matter the training no matter the facilities within 2 months of day one half of my first team is injured this game is seriously broken right now if there are not major fixes i can consider my fm addiction cured

played football manager since its inception in 84 on the zx spectrum this is one of the worst in the series for multiple reasons the devs seem to have the notion of more is constantly better whilst getting the fundamentals of the game which always stood it above the rest completely wrong i have thousands of hours in football manager games and never been compelled to write a negative review although playable is not great the series has gone downhill the last few years in my opinion

dont get me wrong i love football manager the layout is great and everything runs smoother than previous iterations that is great as i always felt it was a minor problem however why in seven hells is every decent youth player worth from 200k to around 2 million but when you try to purchase them for maybe 3 million 4 million the club asks for something ridiculous upwards of 25 million seriously the best i can do is constantly buy old players who wont be ridiculously over priced timo werner for example i can buy lionel messi for just under his jaw dropping price tag of 62 million lets be realistic here abromovich would be laughing if mourinho wanted that player and was asking him for that amount of money seriously this is meant to be the most realistic football management simulation sort it out please oh and just as a final note i really dont find it realistic if 7 of my first team get injured in a single match for 5 months each does anyone know when the next update is

this has to be this worst fm for a long time i cant seem to get into it like the others and match engine doesnt seem as good ive no idea why the devs felt the need to change the match engine again because they changed it in fm 14 and that was bugged on release as well but alot better than in this version when players are running with the ball its as though they are running in thick mud cos they are so slow goalkeepers are broken they cant seem to save anything the ui is bad as well no idea why they felt the need to change it selecting your team line up now requires more clicks and takes longer cos of the changes i really hope the devs fix the issues but overall this game is a disappointment over previous fm games

do not buy this game check my games list you will see that i once loved fm games not anymore and never again will i buy one this is the type of unfinished game that steam need to ban from being sold certain key components dont even work at all a small example is that there are no penalties from handballs right now the game fails in every way it could the me is a poor imitation of a crossing and set pieces simulator not a football simulator it is worse than the last three years versions upon release and i can assure you that they all had bugs and issues not this many or this bad if you really need more just go to the forums and read not many that will claim this game is anywhere near in a playable state maybe in 78 months from the time i write this si will have released a patch that makes it something like a game oh if that wasnt enough beware si and sega are not cooperating and are in fact sending customers with issues back and forth between them not me but check forum if you care also be aware that si are deleting the vast majority of negative posts claiming it will affect the way our customers play the game which is of course true they wouldnt play it because they would know whats wrong with it

i wouldnt recommend buying this game until a few patches are released the release version is full of bugs especially the match engine that makes it almost unplayable i mean sure you can play it but you just have to cringe at all the goals scored from obvious match engine bugs at this point 50% of goals are scored from crosses on the wing that your defenders just dont contest 30% scored from set pieces 10% scored on missplaced backpasses to the keeper and 10% for the rest the defense and goalie are so terrible most matches end with 4 goals scored if you want to win just make sure you have wingers who like to hug the touchline and cross the ball instead of cutting inside should have expected it really it is the first time i buy fm right on the release date

its decent installment again but nothing much is new i paid 35 bucks for this and just upgraded from the beta to the full game and i dont notice a single difference everything still is as shady as in the beta  this just wont stand it means theyve probably had this game ready for ages since the changes are just graphical mostly and want to hussle us as much as they can of course the engine  card  injury system is messed up on launch as usual too ffs why do i keep falling for their scummy tricks i cant recommend anyone buying this now get it for 1520 bucks and after a few patches and maybe then its a decent update had to choose thumbsdown until the state of the game changes then my review might change too edit just got a crash dump error for the second time as well im done with this till they patch it back to fm14 it is sigh  edit 2 the only thing fixed are the crash dumps i no longer get crashes but the match engine is still so random and terrible that i dont even want to play no more edit 3 20122014 almost winter and this game is still a mess you can lose to the number 18 of the league with your best eleven and then 3 days later win against a stronger opponent with your bsquad for no reason at all si should be ashamed of themselves

im a fifa manager guy however as it has been discontinued i had to move to football manager a friend taught me the ropes and ive been playing for a while i played with liverpool ac milan bayer leverkusen and atltico madrid no game has gone to midseason i studied researched and spent a lot of time talking with friends about this game i wish i hadnt this is just the worst manager game ive ever played for a simple reason nothing you do matters i bought marco reus and alex oxdalechamberlain to play on the wings might as well have kept the money for myself and used emile heskey and djimi traor there the most skilled player cannot dribble past the worst defender the best crosser of the ball cannot beat the first man the tallest and best header cannot score 3 goals a season from crosses every team play the exact same way and most goals come from the same three things shots from outside the box defensive mistakes and freekicks in upwards of 300 hours spent in the game i dont think i saw a single goal from a corner however three times i saw a goalkeeper handle the ball outside the box and get booked and two of those freekicks resulted in goals players are so unbelievably stupid that its annoying steven gerrard to take a free kick on the edge of the box you think hes going for goal no hes going to pass it back to the left back who will then try to dribble and lose it you think asmir begovic is a good goalkeeper well hes not above handling the ball outside of the box when trying to boot it upfield id always been told that football manager was all about the tactics and that it is the hardest thing to manage well it is hard specially because no matter how you set your team up to play they will always play the same way you can try to get the best passers of the game but they will misplace at least 30% of their 6 yard passes this is so frustrating im at a loss for words injuries well hows this for a list before the third match of the season i had the following players injured steven gerrard jordan henderson alex oxdalechamberlain alberto moreno john flanagan marco reus adam lallana daniel sturridge asmir begovic and mario balotelli thats before the third match all of those players bar lallana and reus who are injured at the start of the season got injured during pre season seriously unless this game is heavily patched to fix everything thats not just wrong but plain dumb ill be forced to stop playing a genre i really enjoy because ea were not competent enough to keep fifa manager going and because sega apparently have no clue what a football match looks like ill wait and see but i will not hope for much

i cant recommend this in its current state too many injuries and a poor match engine with either unlikely goals or very lopsided results or where you can have all the best players be accomplished in all your tatics and have 100% motivation and still lose to the same team because the match engine decides you have to lose even though you have better possession attack and a whole bunch of players i had one game where the opposition went in and stoked it up and i had 9 injuries as a result with the opposition having no yellow cards the match engine seems not to reward those who attempt to play possession based soccer and it seems a case of just learning the same couple of tatics and rotating them or changing from control to attacking and you can win way too easily unless the game refuses to let you win against one team buying and selling players well a lot of the decent youth players the opposition wants in excess of 90 million pounds for went back to 2012 and had more fun then i did with fm15 after one season on 15 im out mabye after feb it will be better but for now i cant be stuffed

at first i thought this game was a massive step up on fm 14 but after playing for only a few hours i have realised what a massive dissapointment this game really is i knoiw itss only beta but so many things need changing that i cant see the end products as being that good first of all injuries are outragious you are guaranteed to get an injury a game and can find yourself without you key players only 4 games in to the season second problem is the new match engine the amount of times my players have just stood there and watched charlie adams ping a 50 yard screamer in whilst my keeper does nothing is ridiculos seriously though the ai rarely do anyting the transfers are so unrealistic the value of a player might be 10 million but you will end up having to pay 40 million for a decent player finally the worst part is the inconsistency of the matches you can go and play manchester city away and thrash the 60 and then lose at home to west brom 40 this was a problem in early fm 14 and that got soon fixed im not saying you should win every game but the game feels too inconsistant there isnt enough realism in matches i have been looking forward to fm 15 for a while now and am quite dissapointed so far at this stage tbh i wouldt recommend fm 15 untill things have been changed people are rating this game because i told my player i was gonnna sell him and he got upset that has been in fm for an age and isnt a real addition there are positives of this game but not enough

i see some improvements in the graphics i have tried the game four times now and had 39 injuries which is quite unrealistic also you drill a counter tactics and never ever display transitions where you catch the opponent off balance i have been a coach for many years and to actually see the tactics trained expressed in the graphics well it aint happening thus the game lacks realism or ability to convert programming into challenging gameplay

truly a horrible game to play the game engine match engine and what is referred to as the ai actually just a randomisation engine based on mathematical equation is defective the players do not have any realistic actions or movements the defensive simply does not work especially crossballs which is impossible to defend against your central defenders will try crossballs from deep regardsless of their shortt passing and less risky passing your team will miss 45 clear cut chances every match the opponent goalkeeper will always play high above level and your opponents players are always faster then yours there has been so much focus on the administrative part of the game that the actual playing a match part of the game has been overlooked and as for the administrative part it is boring and doll constant and repeating media questions before and after every single match makes one set of the assistant manager to handle it individual traning for players is gone completely in order to facilitate new players basically making the game easier to the point of being dumb and this is in normal mode they originally made the fm classic mode for that purpose there are a few positives like the new scouting system and staff system and the ui has been improved as well but those things are easily forgotten in the face of the overwhelming onslaught of errors and lazy programming all in all it is hard to see how this game got through testing just kidding sigames never test their games before release and they do not care about correcting errors and flaws most of what i have written was reported doing the beta fase of the game but nothing was done about it the beta was version 151 and the game is now on 1513 so 3 versions later and nothing has changed my advice do not buy this game it is defective and it is unlikely that it will ever be fixed it reminds of fm2005 and fm2013 they were defective from the beginning and it was never fixed ps the metascore is faked there are always equal number of positive reviews to the negative ones and they always give equal opposite score

this game is the worst football manager so far the steam engine is very poor and i cant contact steam support to help me with any of my issues i uninstalled the game and tried to reinstall it but it says its already purchased so i cant even see if that works the maintenance on the game is shocking the previous games have never been this bad i will strongly consider never going near steam ever again after this shambles id recommend everyone stay away from this game if you have no time for terrible help and no maintenance

before the fan boys and girls scream and shout at me for not recommending this game please note i love the game however not much has changed in the last few years and this is another rearranged database update with a spit and polished 3d engine which is still lacking a lot of work that said if you are a fan of fm you probably already bought it like i did because you have done every year since the day dot and will do every year regardless so if you are new to this its going to look great if you are an older fm player then yes its another database update with a sidebar

poor gameplay everyone is injured within a month teams asking ridiculous prices for youngsters 3d gameplay isnt that different might as well apply no tactics doesnt really affect the game not worth the money feels like such a lazy job done on this one keep playing fm 14 doing yourself a favor trust me played every fm since the franchise came out and this one is just failtastic

ive played every fm and champ manager before they split and while some have set the bar low and some have had glitches this is by far the worst both single and multiplayer games seem to have the worst ai ive ever seen passes going off in random directions at least 1015 times per match and every match win lose or draw in multiplayer having at least 68 goals i preordered and am really dissapointed that i did i expect subsequent patches to vastly improve the quality of the gameplay but in the meantime id have to say dont buy this until its fixed we have given up our usual multiplayer game because it is almost unplayable

overall this year was a disappointment for me first i dont like the dark skin but well its just my taste injuries everyone mentions about it i think its not just the number of players injured which is the problem the problem is the duration of those injuries while playing with corinthians at some point i had 7 players out for 56 months with broken legs all happened during matches and i play this game at a good level for 6 years i know how to reduce them it is just broken players are just  just 3 weeks after some jackass signs a new contract he becomes unhappy with his contract and asking for a new one if a player is playing well he becomes unhappy in any case he wants more salary a new challenge or is flattered by interest of a bigger club player is on international duty for 40 days and he becomes unhappy for not being in the first team same goes with injured players i have a squad of 24 players 21 of them are on international duty and i have a semi final match game is simply absurdly ed up you cant make any alterations on your fixture you cant interact with the fa or your club board for most cases after all i could write down a 50page list on things that are  in the game i wont i just want to tell everyone who considers buying the game i feel like they intentionally made it so  so that we will be forced to buy the ingame editor there is no way you can play this game unless you buy the ingame editor keep it in mind

i was really looking forward to the latest edition of football manager i have been buying them since 2007 this is easily the worst football manager for a long time the match engine underpins this there are a number of issues with it the first is the goals per game there have been numerous occasions where you will go into half time with a score at 33 or more an example of this was when i was playing as newcastle and in a game against liverpool i was 42 up at half time only to eventually loose the game 85 this seems to happen all the time the second is the goalkeepers i have seen some absolutely blinding saves where a goalkeeper will jump from one end of the goal all the way to the other and still hold the ball the next minute a shot from 30 yards will go right down his throat and he seems to jump out the way of it the goal kicks are often very strange i have often been in the situation where the keeper will simply pass it to the opposition striker who simply puts the ball in the net extremely frustrating as you can imagine in addition to this is if a goal keeper makes a save but doesnt hold onto the ball he seems to forget all about it your defenders will also have no interest in it the only person who is will be an opposition player who will run 45 yards for a simple tap in but it only ever seems to be against you it can be comical at times where the defenders are turning on the spot looking in all directions the goalkeeper wandering around the six yard box and a striker skipping through and tapping it in general mistakes with the engine involve every other position as well if youre thinking of getting this game dont wait until they fix it or steer clear for good

avoid football manager 2015 until it is fixed why too many goals conceded ridiculous crippling injuries too many goals from crosses  corners out of control player concerns okay let me start by saying im an huge fm fan ive owned every single copy since the days of its predecessor championship manager so were talking a decade and some therefore its not natural for me to hate on a game ive always loved however this game is awful i have deleted it from my computer and wont be playing it again until it has been patched i bought guardado a three star left mid for back up to tadic i gave him a backup squad member contract after three premier league matches where he came on as a sub in two he began moaning tadic then got injured for 6 months surprise surprise it took guardado 16 premier league matches as a starting player to get over it back up sqaud member i was southampton decent tophalf premier league side i conceded 86 goals in 38 premier league games i tried everything defensive fullbacks five at the back two defensive midfielders defensive setup rigid approach new defensive coaches etc etc etc nothing worked i thought maybe it was a bug with my game i restarted with southampton spent my entire transfer budget on my defense and yet again conceded 75 goals in a single premier league campaign avoid avoid avoid

let me start this by saying i have been playing fm games for a few years now and have thoroughly enjoyed them this is the first year that it has disappointed me so much that i actually tried to lobby to get my money back from steam rather than trust the patch system to right the ship steam obviously flat out refused to help me which i guess its written in the rules and steam lacks any sort of heart for its customers so that was a wasted effort my main irritation is the injuries it seems some of you experience the injury issue and some dont working with sounders fc within two friendlies and a league game i lost obafemi martins brad evans and pineda to injuries during the match 4 days later in what i put in as light training i lost chad barrett for 4 months and ozzie alonso for 3 months those injuries crippled my team for a grand total of 5 months all within the span of a week in my entire life of ever watching soccerfootball i have never ever seen this happen this is supposed to be the most realistic league simulator in all of gaming right well not anymore the other glaring issue is whicher agorathim they use for what i call the fair shake factor in my first friendly i had the seattle sounders with mostly starting level players going up against a regional team semi pro at best and i got smashed 4 to 1 sounders fc almost never get beat especially to teams from what i would consider a beer league team this is terrible they broke football manager 2015 as far as i can tell its not even fun

ive been playing football manager since 9798 game and feel this is probably the worst football manager yet the excessive amount of goals makes the game incredibly unrealistic injuries seem to happen mainly to key players and nobody else the revamped graphics is pretty disappointing and the new skin is harder to use i wish i had bought this as a cd so i could take it back to the shop the games of late have all had at least one small issue such as the amount of times players hit the post in fm2013 but this version seems to have more than ever

well for me it just isnt fun fm lost its fun for me from around fm10  ie it just became too realistic  i think i stopped at fm11 i came back for fm14 on sale and thought it was okay my main problem is that even by cheating you cant win unless you are lucky enough to figure out ongoing tactics  which is kind of tedious and a game killer for me so by using the ingame editor and magically transferring players like messi ronaldo bale ramos pique t silva vidal etc to man utd  dont expect to go play the next game and walk all over the opposition  in fact i gave up when i was being hammered 72 by aston villa  ive been replaying the aston villa game for hours to try to at least draw with them  its not fun opposing ai players have a frustrating ability to just seem faster and more skillful than any player your team has  so its like a player like ronaldo or messi play worse  basically aston villa are playing like they have inherited all of the skills of my team  like it is a glitchbug  aston villa can run up the wing and cross the ball and score nobody touches the ball the winger just runs up the touchline and fires the ball into the back of the net from the wing  they can even do that twice in a game aston villa are scoring astonishing world class goals messi ronaldo bale etc are struggling to play at sunday league level i will buy the fact that you have to somehow find a tactic that works  but how the hell does this affect ronaldos etc ability to run with the ball theres just no fun in magically transferring players to your team and they all of a sudden dont have a clue how to play football they react slower  to me it is like they are hindered by something yet its fair to say other people will claim that they could magically transfer great players to their team and just win 10  0 every game so for me the game is potentially only fun if you prefer the tactics of football and can work out the combinations long gone are the days of the older fms or cms when you literally could buy the best players in the world and just destroy everything in your path without too much thought about tactics i think i will struggle to continue playing this game because replaying aston villa for hours in reallife just to at least draw with them is kind of pointless

tldr decent management game but lacking innovation and spark worth a sale buy for football fans but nothing more as the lack of new features and stillbroken 3d match engine does not justify the full price tag detailed review in short fm15 is a decent game if only for lack of competition but is a weak entry into the series first off new features wellthere arent any really there is no true innovation that once made the series great and ive been playing since champ man 98 to directly quote the new and improved list on the box the new features are new user interface  which is done every year new scouting centre  which is a mild tweak of the scouting network more realistic player personalities  which is also done every year deeper media experience  which surprisingly gets tweaked every year too so what have i just paid for apparently an updated database a few tweaks and a new clunky ui just like last year i think this speaks volumes about the games development if the marketing team are highlighting these as the new and improved features putting aside new features or lack thereof ill discuss the actual features player personalities despite claims of being improved have regressed to the point of manic depression rampant in fm13 im getting transfer requests and complaints if players dont feature in every game regardless of form fitness or squad position i regularly play all of my senior players being an advocate of rotation to minimise fatigue and injury and i have regular players complain about lack of game time if they arent in the first 11 for as few as 2 or 3 games players also cannot take criticism or praise for that matter ive criticised players with below 610 ratings and had them say they played well and praised a 910 hat trick scoring player for him to say that he was disappointed that i thought hed played well personalities dont seem to count for anything all players seem to be volatile in my game with a 5050 chance of positive or negative reaction whether justified or not the match day experience hasnt changed much except you now get occasional tunnel interviews and can give pep talks from the touchline tunnel interviews happen at random points and play out in the exact same way as media interviews only you cannot seem to skip them or send the assistant it is tedious and repetitive however being able to give touchline pep talks is a great implementation allowing you praise or berate players as needed to spur them on further im not sure whether there is actually an effect or if it is just placebo but it is a nice inclusion the 3d match engine is unsurprisingly still broken but unlike last year where i could only really fault the defensive ai all aspects of ai is broken for both your team and the opponent missing open goals passing to the opposition letting loose balls run free for both scoring and conceding chances not marking poor movement even worse animations players completely ignoring instructions the list goes on these issues just lead to dull games whether winning or losing personally i think the 3d match engine needs to be scrapped entirely as si have consistently failed to fix widely criticised issues the workaround i have used since 2009 is to use the 2d engine giving reasonably realistic performances and scorelines and is still something i do in this installment out of match experience is incredibly enoyable updated ffp rules mean you really have to budget and plan for smaller or in trouble clubs and transfer fees are still reasonably realistic compared to a few years ago where they would often inflate out of control as seasons progressed there is also more interaction with players such as being able to convince players otherwise out of reach or too good for a club to actually join with the promise of trophies progression or captaincy most players also seem to be realistic about demands too for 2nd and lower tier clubs i have signed some good players coming back from long term injury on reduced terms than they would otherwise be expecting summary overall the game is a decent enough football management sim its great being able to buy players plan tactics and watch everything flourish where i am taking issue with the game as i have for a good 3 years now are the lack of new features and the still present broken ones the 3d engine is widely criticised and has been since inclusion due to poor ai yet si persist with it and never seem to fix it its reached the point where they should abandon that feature and concentrate on their strengths of simulating the running of a football club and player development the lack of true new features is disappointing because there has been no innovation since the 3d match engine back in 2009 there is far more that they can do with the game such as being able to have some interaction with upgrading or building new club facilities training centres camps etc how and when to upgrade stadia creating new feeder teams in upcoming leagues such as mls personally i think that the lack of real competition has caused si to become complacent with new features the game just feels like an updated database of players with a new wrapper yet for all of its flaws it still scratches an itch of running a football club 510

terrible game ive been buying football manager every year for gods know how many years and this has to be the worse one by far too many bugs even with updates just recently lost all my saved games due to updates interface is ugly gameplay is boring why has it been getting progressively worse each year it should be getting better im disappointed because i loved this game good in a way because i wont be wasting my life playing it no more

wont be buying football manager 16 as this game is on another level such as price you have to pay for players it can be up 2000% there value wingers run and gradually slow down then are tackled and if a ball goes over the line it is a goal but according to football manager thats not a goal and what is it with clubs not having the badge plus cup logos and kits all ready included if i pay 30 pound for a game i want the game to have the club logos and cup logos and real names many many thing needed to be improved the acutual 3d game when watched is nothing like football a child could tell that 510 need serious improvement to match the price ps sicki baba

would be good if it was not for  the ai cheats and handicaps you immensely  the commands you give to players 9 out of 10 times are really lazily being followed how often im not facing a loss because you know players who even are in a good morale do not follow the ing orders  more known teams are getting artificial bonuses which help them win even if their team is inferior  referee ai is unfair towards the human player and cannot detect schwalbes either  amount of players on the transfer list is well complete and utter  maybe its because of selecting just a limited amount of countries but just 56 players at any given moment on the transfer list come ing on

worst 2999 ive spent on a game this is my first review which will probably show but i felt i had to warn people i was really looking forward to getting this game and thought it looked amazing when i first started playing it the stadia and player animation are great and the feel of the prematch game itself is good training and scouting are easy to manage as is the creation of friendly matches board and player interaction is fine and i particularly like how whole team chats work if only i could say the same for the rest of it i am currently half way through my fourth season and am so frustrated with the game ive given it a reasonably good chance check my hours played not as many as others granted but still quite a bit considering the flaws in the game and here i am sitting as usual with half my first team medium or long term injured ive hired better physios tweaked training to ensure that it wasnt too strenuous and ensured that my coaches were well matched to training routines still its happening ive checked others reviews and plenty of people are finding the same si need to resolve this the game is completely unrealistic in this area and its spoiling it for myself and others who have sadly paid good money for the pleasure of playing it the other big fault is the performance of goalies when the match engine is running i mean a 23 cap goalie with 1720 for one on ones standing with hands on hips with messi bursting into the penalty box goalies with high stats for jumping reach and agility unable to reach a chest height shot from a marauding opposition defender a new update came in today and i was hoping at least one of these two problems would be sorted i played four matches against mediocre sides 12 04 10 woohoo and 03 im no fm tactical expert but im not by any means a noob or a rookie ive been playing si football management games each year since championship manager 93 yep 1993 <grabs flat cap pipe and slippers> have in past games won plenty of back to back promotions won european trophies and plenty of league championships i buy players specifically to fit my systems and use their info to adjust strategies my understanding of tactics cant be that bad of all the 20 odd si games in the original cm fm series that ive played this one is the most inconsistent and most frustrating of all of them in the four matches played today in addition to the 6 long mid term injured first team players out i had injuries as follows game 1  cm and wb both out 911 days game 2  no injuries game 3  cm cd and lone striker all out between 911 days and 3 weeks each game 4  wb out 6 days oh and a training injury to my 2nd best wb  out for 2 weeks from half way between game 3 and game 4 will probably have wait until fm 2016 before these flaws are resolved people have been raising them on forums for months now and nothing has been done however sis attention will most likely be firmly on thinking on the next game in the series unlikely that anyone from si will read this but if they do  remember that people have paid for this game guys im pretty sure that from what i remember cm and fm games used to be delayed until the match engine was just right that was worth it this time its been comparatively all looks and no substance which is a real shame for now im going back to playing champ manager 9394 on my old amiga anyone remember them 18 players called tadeusz kruszinski and only english leagues available but at least it had a match engine that worked
not recommended
honestly theyve had problems this year cons  horrible goalkeeping  atrocious defensive positioning  lackluster finishing  corner glitches  cannot win headers  you can 65 shots and still end the game without a goal  your opponents only need one shot to score  key players gets mad because you sold a player with no potential  ronaldo and jese are willing to join arsenal after i finished 6th in my first and second season cant see that happening in real life    and worst of all once i start a game it gets boring really quickly though thats my problem pros  its a football game

this is def the worst fm i have ever played and i have been playing them for nearly 20 years now why is it so bad well currently i havent won an away game despite in nearly every match i have over 30 shots on goal and the opposition has less then 5 whats the result 1 nill loss it doesnt matter what formation i use what players i use everytime 1 nill loss then the other matches in the league 61 is a fairly normal score it just doesnt seem to make sense i think im going to go backj to fm12 at least it made sense
not recommended
interface lag ruins it for me also sometimes i feel as if ive been fifaed with the whole 35 shots 19 on target for your team against 3 shots 1 on target and you lose 10 or my personal favorite 35 shots 19 on target for your team and 2 shots 2 on target for the opposition and you lose 21 alot of really enjoyable aspects to the game including the engine still rather hoping for further upgrades in that department the sim aspect is wonderful though
not recommended
this game sucks in the match mode players will just stand and let the opposition get the ball goalkeepers will let the ball slip through them not just once but this happens virtually every game which it just wouldnt in the premier leauge defenders just dont tackle and let players run past them whatever good work si have done in the past few years has been undone by this abomination

i have had football manager since 2010 enjoyed playing iit greatly for years i enjoyed the ability to micromanage the little things in the game mainly the sliders if my team was getting scored on a great deal move thedefensive line slider back a few notches of which i had twenty a few years ago they decided to do away with the sliders but keep them optional to simplify the game fine i still have them the last few years completly gone and its obvious to anyone who plays the game that the system is exactly the same the player and team instructions are still moving sliders in the background so i am at the point where i am just not interested in the game anymore i am sure there are people out there that like to tinker and micromanage their games people that enjoy games like europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2 football manager has been one of my favorite games i hope they can listen to their fans and bring back what we all loved about the game

buy fm every year but this one is by far the worst theyve put out in a long time i find it impossible to have a good season i tried with arsenal and got 10 games in and in that time i managed to also get knocked out of the champions league qualifiers by some team ive never heard of and ive heard of a lot i couldnt get one win in the league no matter what i did 20 shots 5 clear chances 0 goals opposition 1 shot 1 goal pfft it wasnt my tactics or the roles i had my players in or the players i used considering i bought a few big names and then i would put my team out and go and lose 40 to burnley sounds realistic to me another game with derby ended up 15th even though theyre predicted 9th and i improved the squad greatly its far too unknown they need to find a way that we can look into why we cant get results because imo theres nothing in the game that should have me losing 40 at home to burnley when id checked everything like tactics formations player roles morale team instructions

ok i regret to say that i am editing my review from being a positive one to a very negative one read below and you will see i am a fm vet of many years sad to say this is the worste fm i have ever played the full release is no diffrent to the beta my main issue is the relentless injuries and inabblity to sign players i have 6 injuries at any given time i started a new game with man city and i have 9 injuries at the moment i have not even had a chance to play david silva as he gets injured every 2 seconds the colour scheme is very poor and there arnt even proper badges for bpl teams the action bar seems to get smaller and smaller every year si dont forget that the vet players have used the action bar for years we dont use the 2d or 3d view thats not footballmanger players fall out with you for selling an uknown 15 year old with cf with 2 finishing whats that about its all just been simplified and not in a good way sorry fm i have loved you for 20 odd years but now i am falling out of love i am bitterly dissapointed to the point of wanting a refund i feel like i have paid 30 quid for a beta thanks  game developers in 2014 are taking us all for a ride bellow is my old positive review while playing the beta if it wernt for the houndreds and thousands of hours ive spent playing football manager since i was 11 years old i may have achivied something with my life ive been playing since it was championship manager 2000 the season luis figo joined madrid im now 29 and living at home with my mum warning new players this game will take over your life you will never get laid again now to the review ok so theres no badges for the english premier league teams but its still seems like an improvment on last years there are a few new features and layouts to get used to the screens have changed a lot tac screen ect is completely diffrent the news headline page almost made me throw up when i saw the relentlessly awfull culours lucky you can change you landing screen so you never have to view that mess again lol all in all after 3 hours of playing i hardly scratched the surface of the new features injuries also seem a little relentless but i am hoping these will be ironed out after the beta i hope this review helps ok i am adding in a little moan i have done 3 seasons with barca and finaly have the transfer embargo liffted however i cant sign anyone i mean juventus want 300 million for pogba and he keeps saying he wants to join but does not hand in a transfer request also other players are demanding huge fees chelsea want 80 million for azplicueta i am all for making the game realistic but i need to sign players at some point the game is out today and i am now bored of it for the first year in 20 i may be free

ive played until the end of the january transfer windows in my first season in the premiership basically my opinion is that the game has no realism as previous fms have been the game is competely full of injuries penalties and high scoring games that would simply no happen in real life having read reviews of other gamers of fm15 it would appear that im not alone on this a update is badly needed for this as for the 3d match engine it looks like a cross between table top football and subbuteo fm has been using the 3d match engine for many years now and it would appear that it has hardly been improved despite all the techology available these days im afraid that the game is no longer enjoyable i would recommend anyone sitting on the fence about buying it to avoid it stick to fm14 until they sort this out

as someone with no previous experience in this series and no grasp of football beyond the immidiate game i found this game absolutely impenetrable i enjoy the managing of complex systems huge fan of crusader kings 2 and can see how there is a rich variety of options and nuiance available that said the game is lacking in a clear entry point for the true noivce the beginner difficultymode as best i can tell only adds small text notes with insipid hints like this is the sidebar menu with has options for manging your team after hitting use suggestion during the setup a few times which was useful you are dumped to a general game screen with 1000s of options and no clear direction it is fine to have numerous tools at the players disposal that they dont appreicate immediately but you need to tutorialize the core game in some way as a starting point for them to explore and build off from instead it left the clear impression that you need to go watch some youtube videos of other players for several hours to get the basics making it feel more like learning a software interface than playing a game i will however say kudos to the developer for having a free weekend to try the game out at no risk the downside to this is that players will on a lark just try the game without doing a little reseach first if this was something i was condsidering purchasing i would have likely watched some videos and incidently picked up the training necessary to play before experiencing it first hand please consider adding a proper tutorial if you are going to have a freetoplay weekend so people have a chance to enjoy the opportunity

two main things really get me angry about the fm series first off the match engine is not something to be expected for a anno 2014 game without getting more detailed it is obvious that si doesnt want this to be improved as modern technology at tjis point really could offer something a hundred times better wake up si were not handheld here ps praise the lord that this sht is still better than eas fifa manager  the second most important thing for me is the pretty low amount of team licences offered by the game this really bugs me because even if you play a manager game for the management style you still have that favorite team it really bugs me how si doesnt have team licences for first division teams across europe

having put in 1000 or so hours into the 2011 2012 and 2013 versions altogether i can safely say that football manager 2015 is the worst ive played so far and not worst as in its still enjoyable worst as in its just not a good or fun game anymore something has been changed since those games that i cant explain sides with the best defence in the leage concede 4 in the first 10 minutes of the game the top 4 teams in real life lounge around in lower mid table positions youth players ask for wages of a consistent first team player and the match engine dear god the match engine players are clearly fouled but the referees do nothing players simply stand and watch as others walk past them tackles are so few and far between that im not sure playing defenders is worth it and scores with 8 goals or more are not nearly as rare as they should be if you want to play football manager get 2012 or 2013 because this one sucks

figured id give this game a try since its so highly recommended and seemed interesting what i ended up getting was a huge amount of information poured into my brain at such a fast speed that there was hardly time to process it all im not very familiar with football anyway but with hardly anything getting explained and the supposed indepth tutorial only providing the occasional bubble of explanation its very easy to get lost in this game very quickly and end up in a situation where you can just stare at the screen saying i have no idea what any of this means does or why its important

was finally due to the sale price enticed to buy the game got pretty excited i found the new layout to be quite nifty interactions were nifty and then it got to the point where i was taking a closer look at my favorite club which is at point of writing at least still in the top 50 of biggest european clubs  the budget was all wrong some player names were horribly botched positions were botched potential for the academy players and status in the club was just awfully put together transfervalues were completely messed up the man whos supposedly the player with the highest value in the squad is actually in real life the most shunned and loathed player who the fans hope the club gets rid of as soon as they can and a substitute at most the list goes on and on and on cant recommend something that made me so upset right off the bat

this is last time im buying football manager they dont make any real updates i mean i dont see any real difference between fm2012 and fm2015 transferring tactics training most importantly the ai wont get any real improvement every year we will get new animations for 3d and since i play in 2d i dont really care about them we get a new gui ever year as wel idk why they would change it all the time few more minor updates so basicly we pay to play same game with a better or lets say different lookso if u have fm201213 or 14 dont even bother getting fm15 just find transfer updates from somewhere btw fm 2016 will have a new feature  coach animations  that is exactly what we need

absolutely awful game it makes no difference who you play who you sign or how you play you will end up having a ridiculous amount of shots onoff target most games in the high teens or even 20s and still somehow lose theres no such thing as consistancy in the game at all beat athletico madrid with liverpool 3 0 then subsequently went on to lose to burnley and stoke with same teamtactics for example i had the same issues with the previous game but thought id give this one a go anyways i regret my decision massively 20 down the drain i wouldnt buy this game again if it was 2 do youself a fabour and avoid this game like the plague

recently moved from fm13 to fm15 only because fm13 developed some bug preventing it loading not sure why and have to say im really disappointedmenu options and buttons just disappear and picking changing your team isnt as easyremoving players from the team the player position box too big so other useful info cant be displayed when making subs you cant tell what positions the players you have available can cover etc etc perhaps its a case of getting used to it but seriously considering trading it in and getting a new fm13 poor

skip this one i went back to 2014 fairly quickly after the excitement of trying a new fm had faded there are some nice additions to the game but theyve also changed what wasnt broken and in doing so have destroyed the realistic play seen in 14 the match engine with some new graphical additions off the pitch which are quite cool is simply nowhere near good enough for general release the redesign of the players and their animations is atrocious if you can watch a match and not notice the hilarious arms of the players then youre lyring to yourself this is more like an experiment with ragdoll physics than a football match engine players plod about the pitch with no real life in them the ball moves poorly and the pitches now look bogged down and ugly as hell no matter where you are tactics are not easy to really see in the match itself nothing is realistic in terms of the way the team moves the ball and thats on top of the horrible animations keepers are a little better animated and as i mentioned the stadiums have more detail and things but that doesnt make up for the core element of the game being so badly designed fm2014 isnt perfect but the match engine craps all over this one from a great height gone are the days of your lightning winger flying past his full back and getting a cross in now they waddle around with all the urgency of a bored duck theres no more slick passing moves that take into account your tactical instrucions the ball now moves so slow and the poor new sound effect for the ball being hit doesnt help again it just sludges around the pitch to no great effect the colours of shirts and things are also far too bright for no reason this wasnt present in 2014 there are things i really like female managers extra things to say to players a way to convince players your club is the one for them the sidebar being more intuitive and things generally being placed in area where theyre more easy to find and helpful than previous working my way through preseason i was absolutely enthralled with this game until the first friendly kicked off and the immersion just vanished in front of my eyes how pale are the really white players now they look ill arms are pathetic tricks are pathetic the whole thing looks far less graphically impressive than 14 which is hardly fifa level to begin with theres no excuse for this and no way to return the game and spend the money on something else like both seasons of walking dead get fm2014 with a good skin and all the badges logos etc from the workshop and save yourself some money on this checking back in october to see if theyve reworked the engine if not then i might have to finally say si have lost their way

i have bought this franchise every year religiously since it very first came out this is the first year i have felt cheated out of my money where to start the new side bar makes things complicated for no reason whatsoever the old system was fine and didnt need changing it might just be me but the whole feel of the game has a far more fake feel about it while at the same time trying to add an unnecessary amout of realism i know this is a game but i somehow felt more connected to players and staff in the old one then you get to the matches the worst part of the game however is the god awful match engine the players look like chickens with flapping arms opposition goalkeepers appear to be the lovechild of neuer and buffon whereas mine has all the ability of a paraglegic my defnders seem to think that marking from corners means marking the corner of the six yard box and not moving and the guys on the posts are superglued there i took charge of manchester united incredible attack and i added well too yet my team had no answers to the might of the mls teams on tour pre season i went back over these games tried various formations and even went as far as using the in game editor to make all my players level20 on everything and still we were soundly beaten this seems to be a big flaw from other reviews i have read too as does the crazy scorelines i managed to pull off a 76 win over southampton with their cb scoring a hattrick from corners due to afforementioned problems and another fabulous 85 win over qpr after being 40 up and going behind 45 it has so many issues right now it is just not worth the outlay top and bottom if you have fm14 do not buy this game udpade the players and enjoy as it is superior to this in every way

this is literally the worst football manager game ever made i know its just the beta but it is still  your players get injured all the time and is out for weeks maybe months there is about 56 goals every freaking game and your players complain about little playtime after just one game on the bench also where is the bench were you set up your team before the game and how do you click your players onto the field and bench without dragging them over another players position the real game have to improve by 100% to make this a good game because right now it sucks wake up you tried to make it more realistic and you managed to send the game back to the stone age well done

this is my first fm i have got on pc i have previously had it on hand held i find the game fun but it can be rather unrealistic i play a game and there might be 78 goals in a game its ridiculous i find it very fustrating i also find that signing players is to hard this could be that i am just new to fm and just not very good but all the clubs seem to want 4 times the players value hope there will be an update soon

i didnt like the game at all i cant even play it the colors of the background really hurt my eyes i cant look more than 10 mins i played football manager 13 before and that was much better than this background is fully black and all the other lively colors make it hard to read and you cant personalize this you cant see the additional packs bought in the game i am really frustrated i cant see the full pitch while playing in 2d mode i can not search for players after 2 transfers what is wrong this year

this is the 2nd time i have decided to give a review of this game my first review i gave a negative review out of frustration down to the game keep crashing however after uninstalling and reinstalling and giving it a good go i have decided to change my review to a more positve review under reviewal though im not sure i can wholeheartedly give this a 100 pcnt positive review so mid writing this review ive reviewd my decision to review 610 not enough progression from previos versions for me

paid 30 for the game it wont even start as soon as i click play i get a serious error fm2015v1521 message i tried looking for support on the communitysigames page but their website didnt give me permission to look at the fix pages saying i needed an account with their website i looked on the sega website for support again it didnt give me permission to open their fix pages im sure the games fine but the severe lack of support and customer service not to mention the many other people that appear to have the same problem means i have to give a thumbs down

its quite easy creating a tactic that creates a lot of chances millions of clearcuts but you see when a clear cut chance is created the game rolls two dice and if they aint both a six you do not score this is a game of chance and i have had more fun playing headstails

i just dont understand i have played fm 2013 quite regulary its not perfect but its accessible i have always made light of the match engine yes it has its problems but it has never angered me to the point that i feel its actively working against me fm 2015 has some really unique in depth features compared to fm 13 more events happen between players prematch build up and the scouting system feels much more accurate the problem i am having here is that i dont think i have really played enough to review the game i just know that i have played enough to not reccomend it to anyone match preperation was a great part of the game yet my formations are never trained enough in preseason even with a very high workload i wouldnt mind if this also applied to the teams i am not in control of it is entirely evident though that this is not the case with time i think i could become invested in this game however the turmoil of early game problems has led me to return to an earlier version of the game for my fm fix just go and play an earlier version and save yourself the trouble edit after spending several more hours i simply cant get into this game theoretically the more accurate aspects of this years release should create a better fm experience yet this is simply not the case the plethora of new tactical roles just bemuddles the overall system i really question if even half of these are used frequently in the real life game especially outside of the top flight of leagues i think overall enjoyment has been sacrificed on the altar of depth if you want a tactical system which requires constant maintenance and player recruitment which takes hours of trawling through players and weeks upon weeks of scouting reports i could possibly reccomend this game over previous releases also the new interface is absolutely shocking luckily the workshop provides some good alternatives

i had this sitting on my wishlist for more than a month before i decided to risk everything and buy it i was hoping to get it on sale but i got so bored with my other games i couldnt wait any longer being a long time player of the ea fifa manager series now discontinued and a one time player of fm years ago and read all the recent bad reviews i thought i was going in with my eyes open i knew what i wanted in a football manager game and this one just didnt deliver  particularly on the matchday experience everything was cool to begin with having to go for job interviews to get a manager gig etc i thought that was unique the whole build up to match day was good choosing tactics and formations etc its all very very detailed i was quite happy to tinker for hours before i decided to plough through to a friendly match then i was presented with the most godawful ui for match day and a 1980s 3d rendition of a football match which i eventually turned it 2d mode because i couldnt stand it for a game that has been around for how long this 3d match engine is appalling they would be much better off just having a text ticker for gameplay rather than a halfa55ed attempt at a 3d game engine i hated the interface for actual match play way too much clutter nothing intuitive you could only have 1 or 2 widgets up and running at a time it really hasnt been thought out well i wish i could take the ui and match engine from fifa manager and plug it into this  it would be much more appealing to me sigh another wasted $50 they do refunds around here update ironically within hours of this review it went on sale in steam aaaaaaarghhhhh

i have been playing his game like 23 weeks and its simple its terrible match engine its year after years worst and worst player dont do anything you tell them complete the opposite i had a right back tell him to short pass as soon as he receives the ball bom long ball to nowhere the only thing the had to do was keep the same me from 2012 and thats all just a few things here and there and you could sell this game year after year without problem si has spend a lot of time to do it and when the put the game on sale its full of bugs probably in december 2015 this game will be playable with hundreds of patches but at that time we are going to be talking about fm 2016 i dont know its so much things i could say or maybe i just dont know how to play the game maybe its too complicated corner kick bugs goalkeeper bugs endless impossible to get a win away play counter defensive offensive wathever you want its useless im starting to repent to put 20 pounds in this terrible

downloaded the weekend trial started a game with nice to see if the injuries are really as bad as they say i had my doubts in my first match with my reserve team there were three players on my squad that were injured two of them for about a week each and the third was out for about 3 weeks injuries are really as bad as they say i know that one match isnt a large sample size but with three injuries against my reserve team i dont feel like wasting anymore time its a shame because i buy these games on an almost yearly basis this years doesnt make the cut

i honestly hate this game so much the ingame mechanics are so unrealistic like the defender just stares at the person running by them and they defend so horribly i defend better than these defenders also the opposition goalkeepers are so overpowered like wtf my player is 2 meters from the goal and the goalkeeper flys from the other side of the goal and grabs it once welbeck shot from the other side of the goal and de gea just teleported to the other side and caught it in real life it would have been a 100% goal this game would be a million times better if it was more realistic ingame

played fm14 before and will gladly stick to 14 longshots and headers dominate in this edition with possessionbased tactics falling by the wearside to be replaced by routeone and direct stuff the match engine is ridiculously inaccurate and keepers are as good as an u12 sunday league keeper wish i never spent full retail price on fm15 hopefully patches balance it out

this sums the game up in my opinion last two games rangers 44 dumbarton 9 yellow cards 6 red cards  3 each all but 1 of the 8 goals were own goals rangers 4  2 motherwell 3 red cards 1 own goal riddled with bugs need major improvement

really dont understand how the me gets worse 2012 was ok just needing a bit of tweaking 2013 onwards have been shocking with the latest being the worst i fully understand that fm is a management simulator and that si will say it isnt meant to be fifaesque in terms of graphics etc but that isnt my gripe the major issue i have with the me is what you see happening in no way relates to your instructions or the stats at the end for example you concede too many from balls over the top so you set the team to defend deeper but when you are viewing the match the back four are still in the halfway line what is the point in having the facility to change something if the me doesnt reflect that change same with ratings a keeper drops one into his own net then kicks a ball stright to the opposition to score his rating is a 7 from what i see he is at fault for two goals yet if i discipline or drop him he thinks its unwarranted as the stats say he played well nothing you see happening relates to stats some of the interplay is laughable world class players look like baby deer trying to kick a ball and the decision making completely at odds with what players especially good ones would do in those situations only real benefit of th game its updated database aside from that its a poor imitation of previous versions save your money

cant quite put my finger on what it is but fm2015 seems to have sucked most of the fun out of the game i fire it up and play for an hour and even though ive gotten used t the new gui im kinda bored im not even a footy fan so feel free to scoff at my review and so i dont care about transfers being up to date etc but even so ive racked up thousands of hours over the years playing fm including when the sw used to be called championship manager im more into the management especially the economical side of things turning around debtridden clubs etc the game is losing its way a bit i think maybe they are just trying to make it too accessible for new players whilst neglecting the strategy elements for their historic userbase

this game has way too much dlc that was very obviously cut out of the game in order to charge more for it instead of allowing files to be modded in their directory it will be sold as a modding tool for the very low price of 5 dollars time to actually review the game if you love having lots of tabs and things to click on that are only there for viewing purposes and cannot be changed then this is the game for you tons of options that will never pay off and rarely have a meaningful impact the game is just in need of being stream lined or having more impactful decisions you are just a coach manager and little more
