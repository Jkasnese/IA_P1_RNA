garrys mod is one of the best sandboxcommunity driven games on pc and possible in gaming if you are going to buy this you should buy css with it since many game modes use those textures in it sandbox mode is nice you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes i would recommend ttt as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in gmod gamemodesactaully it is the engine but eh there are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garrys mod and you will get you 10525 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers a great game with a good community if you know where to look

yes garrys mod was a great game2 years ago now the community is at its end after youtubers made videos about this game the community poured with immature prebuscents they are running unnecessary servers modeled after what they want and not whats best for the server weve got tons of player models for admins only a bunch of poorly coded gunsm9k and just a lot of unneeded addons clogging up loading time admins are super biased and abuse often yet they still beg for donations after a week of the servers opening and this isnt coming from me raging from one server 95% of darkrp and 50% of ttt servers are just like this the facepunch forums are usually kids asking how to make darkrp jobs you may wonder why im still playing this im usually testing my addons in singleplayer if you are pondering to get this game its the worst time to do so this review probably wont affect your decision but please do keep this in mind

update if this was more than two years ago i would have totally recommended this game to everyone as if this game should come with all pcs unfortunately not anymore do you remember when spongebob and patrick went through the perfume department and nearly died well that is what garrys mod is like nowadays as you try and move into this new world and explore the opportunities placed out there for you you dont get sprayed with perfume like in the show you get ambushed by the worst community ever comprised of worst being first toddlers who are still learning how to speak who either scream or cry into dollar tree mics furries that are just utterly terrible fnaf autists who are autists bronies most of which take a game too seriously many others are down right annoying and anime nerds a group that is neither good nor bad as there are some mature people within the group where the good ones are meh but the bad ones are bad it is a rare occurance to find an actual nontard man woman age 16 who doesnt throw a fit over a game drop a ban hammer if questioned or has the ability to squeal so loud into a mic it breaks the sound barrier and sends the listeners off to the gates of hell to be annally massacred by the spirit of the autist himselfherself until a new pewdiepie vid comes on of him screaming into his monitor while he watches diners driveins and dives where then you are given the chance to crawl on all 4s out of there and back to your home browsing the workshop is also just like the perfume department every page is loaded with the exact same content for fnaf let me repeat that exact same fnaf content often there will be some animebronyfurry things but all together arent as oftenly seen as fnaf autist stuff let it be known if you can make it through all of that cancer there is a nice variety of content waiting for you you will mostly see all of this stuff jammed into multiplayer like cinema loaded with the bad anime nerds jailbreak loaded with autists in general or simon says as i would like to call it becauase you know nothing says jailbreak like simon says it doesnt even make sense but for some odd reason the kids who run these servers find it enjoyable to just play simon says for hours upon hours in a jail ment to be broken out of the rp servers are a joke you are hit with the same community and you should expect to be kicked or banned a lot quicker than usual and ttt which is loaded with coppies of the fat kid from sandlot who love to butter themselves up to the mods only few make it out in one piece that being me you think i always looked like this this is the face a person who survived the impossible and made it out with all most of his brain cells or atleast enough to type this all up do yourself a favor and only get this game if you want to just sit in sandbox mode with a friend or two and make stuff for fun but do not do what i did and go into multiplayer because you might not make it back out the same its funny it really is just to sit back and watch a bunch of kids yell incomprehensibly at eachother

410 i wouldve rated 1010 if it wasnt for those kids who upload the exact same thing on the savesdupes im talking to you fnaf fantards seriously this game was great until fnaf came out i remember the days when dupes were something people made for other people to have fun now its just full of fnaf  i really do not reccommend this if you want to play multiplayer i heard some people got banned for not liking fnaf edit  of course this will come to an end but i will keep this review until it is 100% gone
