this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things having done both military service and picked up milsim airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality there are experiences you will have in arma 3 that can not be had in cod or bf experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release one that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower i was squad leader of 8 or so ais as we approached the comms tower and i told my men to go stealth no firing unless fired upon we moved slowly taking advantage of terrain keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and i spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower there i positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as i had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower i considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position but a firefight is always a risk and these ai had been around for a few missions and i had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly i might get hit and killed as i considered how i would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern i realised the tower is unguarded and i had an opportunity to do something i had not considered i got up and ran as fast as i could towards the tower all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head i kept scanning as i ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols after what seemed like far too long i reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention i turned around and made my way back as i closed on my men i started ordering them to fall back hope growing that i might get out of this alive falling back to about 400 meters i finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to command i had done it i had pulled off the perfect mission not a shot fired and all under my command back alive that is what this game is about

this is quite possibly the most emotional shooter ive ever played and its not because of the campaign crowd around children its story time one day not so long ago my squad had just destroyed an antiair battery our pilot landed and the rest of the squad boarded one by one i was about to get in when the rockets started flying the chopper lifted off with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes unwilling to die before then i rushed to the nearest cover a small house by a narrow road i entered to find a ten yearold player who had also been left behind he explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his clan i politely declined explaining that my own squad was inbound as i finished a ghost hawk flew over the horizon my squad had arrived this noble child soldier and i were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting the sniper screamed as a 65 mm cartridge entered his leg his shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as i climbed in the transport my new friend was dead 1010 would experience survivor guilt again

cant tell you if you should buy it or not but i can tell you this you will find annoying bugs highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have but when you really get down to it and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission its something magical you just cant find in any other game arma is not a game which you pick up at launch play the campaign and a bit of mp and then trow away you buy it love it or hate it and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly arma is a game which you can never called finished there will always be added to it be it user or official content fixes features or optimizations hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it  if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare this will be your gem ill give it a 910 simply because screw bugs ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back read i will not accept random friend requests if you have a question please post it in the comments

i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 1020 minutes in a single location sometimes longer i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible unless doing paintballing or airgunning and if you do buy the game  i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game

recommending this game is a nobrainer if you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism arma 3 is inevitable the game wont let you in easily it has a steep learning curve and starting out can be quite frustrating also you are less likely to find good public servers it hardly is hopon and play like cod or battlefield the best way to experience it is in a clan or community group groups range from runandgun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff so there should be something for everybody bottom line go get it its unique in every aspect

tldr detailed review below  devs still dev  realistic gameplay  huge maps  great modding community  great player community  scenario editor  graphics  sound  a lot of weapons and vehicles  choppers  4 different ai difficulties  great and interesting campaign  no more gamespy servers due to shutdown   framerate on many pcs may take some time to fix it  campaign saves may be corrupted after an update  takes time to learn the basics  desync on multiplayer which is a serverplayer issue no arma 3 issue  vehicle physicscollisions hunter can move hemtt etc  karts dlc gameplay arma 3 is a tactical militarywarcombat simulation you control a soldier on 2 huge maps stratis and altis once you get used to the keybindings there are a lot theres nothing that can stop you if you prefer slow and realistic combat over fast fpss such as cs cod or bf its definitely worth checking out arma 3 does not offer a ranking system some servers do and you need to check your surroundings before you start shooting someone otherwise youll end up unconscious in the middle of nowhere scenarios  single player main campaign arma 3 offers a great campaign with an interesting story line youre playing as nato soldier cpl kerry the main campaign is split into 3 chaptersepisodes survive adapt and win in the first chapter you need to survive in a multiforce conflict on stratis its a quite instructive episode showing you the arma 3 101s such as moving diving driving shooting etc theres no popup message showing you what to do but usually you can open a help tab by pressing h the missions on survive are quite controlled but if you keep hiding behind a rock your squad members will have a hard time or even die so if you dont want to be left alone you should do what youre supposed to the second episode plays on altis where you join a local guerilla force in this chapter you learn how to control your own squad and how the communication system works you still have your orders but you can leave the base and explore the map whenever you want playing optional missions or looking for better weapons finally in win you join the nato reinforcment in this chapter you need to show what youve learned so far fighting a lot of enemies  scenarios  workshop  sp  coop the steam workshop offers a lot of user created content which you should definitely check out many of them can be played in coop with friends or even on servers there are some stock arma 3 coop missions you can play as well scenarios  multiplayer there are a lot of servers online which offer a lot of different scenarios and modifications ill cover just a few popular of them domination basically king of the hill where you need to capture cities usually you can use whatever gear you want and choose your function engineer medic commander  every function has its own abilities which you can benefit from most servers also support side missions where you can get new vehicles choppers or jets dominations my personal favourite wasteland its a team deathmatch mode where you can join multiple groups or play on your own you usually start with a pistol and need to findbuy weapons and supplies water food  to survive if you earned enough money you can build your personal fort there are vehicles and choppers on the map but most of them are broken and you need to repairrefuel them but you can also get special vehicles for your team by doing side missions which appear every few minutes certainly the other teams try to do the same thing altis life one of the most popular game modes its basically a cops and robbersroleplay simulation there are police forces which are other players controlling the cities as long as you dont do anything illegal such as killing someone or carry weed with you they wont do anything to you its a fun mode if you want to play arma without shooting someone all the time microphone is recommended scenarios  do it yourself you certainly can host your own server there are a lot of scenarios which you can download and modify arma 3 also offers you an editor which you can use to build your own scenario from scratch its quite hard if you dont know anything about scripting or never used the arma editor before but there are a lot of tutorials on youtube and on forums which you can check out kart dlc theres not much i can tell about the dlc but you can drive karts yay known issues a lot of people are not able to play arma 3 on a stable framerate despite their superior machine if you have any performance issues check out the online tutorials on how to fix it there are a lot of possible ways to increase your performance but worth the money imho definitely its been over a year and the devs still add content check out videos on youtube or try the game on free weekends if youre interested but dont know if its something for you it takes some time to learn the basics dont be frustrated if you die every minute on your first try

hell yes i recommend this game tired of the average fps tired of seeing soldiers of bare twenty years of age running through bullets like theyre nothing play arma feel the real aspects of war as close as a simulator can get it not only are there thousands of choices of weaponry and ways to combine all of it you get a sincere feeling of teamwork and selfaccomplishment when conquering the battlefield or when completeing an objective this game rewards the good thinkers the smart players the gameplay mechanics campaign all of it has blown me away arma is a game id recommend to anyone looking for a healthy change to the average fps

the first few hours of play long can be painful and away most people arma 3 is hard to understand is not for everyone and im sure its not even that the bohemia interactive searches but if you stop to study mechanics shooting techniques positioning azimuth applied physics  studying really hard you fall in love the maps are really great forcing you to use a vehicle to move around the audio is impressive  scares the hell out of anyone who plays for the first time dont optimization is good i confess but if you think of buying this game  buy without fear

arma 3  the greatest mod platform for milsim and roleplaying and im not even lying about the header features  best mod platform on arma series so far  community driven dlcs and mods  good allaround game focused on infantry shooting  devs update the game constantly based on feedback  few old arma bugs arma 3 from bohemia interactive developer of armed assault arma 2 operation flashpoint and dayz has arguably the best gaming experience i have on steam apart from default content which is being developed with the community since the alpha versions and still being guided by those who buy the game the community itself is self sustaining with mods missions scripts addons full conversions and whatever your imagination can bring to you for military simulation arma 3 veteran fanbase is hardcore on milsim which carries on from the first armed assault game a sort of military simulation but a game not fully realistic what the community brings is exactly how much realism you want want to simulate injuries and pain during a firefight want to simulate fatigue and vehicles in a war want to test your strategy and communication skills everything is provided by the community for role players the mod community has some of the best roleplaying missions and addons ive seen so far from petty smugglers to prestigious governors roleplaying and surviving are definely the new possibilities that arma 3 offers as far as fun goes interacting with other players while excercising your creativity and your inner actoractress is a powerful tool for all ages and minds ever wanted to be a cop would you abuse of your power what about being a criminal and causing havoc among citizens these are but few among the roads you can take in your path of roleplaying strategic action zeus in arma 3 is another feature of innovation by bohemia interactive as a game master you are able to create missions and objectives onthego for your fellow teammates guide them to victory or challenge their skills create training missions edit whatever feature you would like in the game world for an immortal being creation and destruction are but just another day in the office

soyoure here to possibly buy arma 3i was in that position before i just bought it when it was 50% off heres a checklist for you do you like call of duty can you 360 no scope in cod do you like 9 year olds screaming on the mic if you answered yes to those then this game is not for you do you like csgo are you a pro awper in csgo well if you answered yes this game will rip you apart and you will be a  sniper do you like simulators do you like military games are you up for the challenge do you want an alternative to joining the military in real life do you have at least $30 if so then you are ready for this challenge  pros massive realistic combat servers with 100 people few squeakers on mics steam workshop many players still today single player modes tutorials and all kinds of training for practice  cons $60 pricey but worth more than any call of duty game  ai  its ok playable lag  this game is apparently heavily dependent on cpu in huge multiplayer games your fps can drop from over 9000 to 20 in a matter of seconds glitches bugs when people shoot from far away it sounds like bb guns trolls in multiplayer  they can steal your helicopters and  you buy or just be a pilot and kamikazi with you in it doesnt come with cookies

its the dead of night on the csatoccupied island of stratis and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos im leading one of two specops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of altis a british squad is in charge of the actual rescue our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the csat forces and give the british the opening they need over the next hour thats precisely what i do inserting by boat from the northwest coast i head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as i swoop in from the west to flank them yet before we can regroup my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north and the british still need more time to complete their mission alone i rush to the southernmost tip of the island where i blow up a fortified antiair position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point where the boat takes me home arguably the biggest complaint about bohemia interactives postflashpoint games is that their campaigns havent used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential the first armas campaign was a hastily cobbledtogether disappointment while it took a certain zombiesurvival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of arma 2s chernarus that arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twentyodd missions is indicative of bohemias effort to resolve this ongoing issue indeed taken as a whole arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive more engaging and more userfriendly experience it isnt completely successful but i had an awful lot of fun watching it try while arma 3 was officially released back in september the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months each chapter is a selfcontained entity with its own story arc and theme combined they tell the tale of the excitingly named corporal ben kerry and his role in the war over the fictional mediterranean island archipelago of altis and stratis waged between four different factions the first part survive is geared towards introducing players to arma it takes place entirely on the smaller of arma 3s two islands stratis and sees kerry banding up with a group of nato survivors after the local altian armed forces backed by natos eastern equivalent csat rise up against the local us garrison for the most part missions are smallscale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the follower category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings its hardly the campaigns most spectacular stage storywise its let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another even here though bohemias approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent missions are nearly always multistaged with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan while it smoulders rather than sparks survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into adapt definitely the best of the three chapters this introduces altis a masterwork of environmental design i could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds its misty dawns crimson dusks and streetlightspeckled nights but whats most important is how the detail thats gone into mapping the landscapes undulations  the lumps and bumps hills and valleys  plays into the games combat a little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy ai when they stop to reload youll rush to locate a better vantage point order your men to find cover an extremely handy new command and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponents surprisingly tough body tactics are vital in arma 3 but its terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure its crucial to learn this before adapt begins because the difficulty suddenly ramps up the first mission sees you alone unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety at this point setting saves to unlimited using armas highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity fittingly after survive you will die many many times that said its important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations smoother weapon handling and better optics  meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slowtoaim weapons adapt also changes the way you play it gives you a squad to control which is a mixed blessing ai units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and apcs but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive and the lack of changes to armas squad commands means this can be a chore especially problematic is ai ammo management your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in arma 3s clumsy interface alongside its story missions which include the brilliant raid on stratis described above adapt also introduces an openworld component from your base you can go out on patrol and complete multiple optional objectives from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex all while collecting weapons ammo and equipment to use during the main missions  though the clunkiness of armas inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be if you want to bring stuff back to base you need to find a vehicle and load it itembyitem from your own inventory while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process after the meatiness of adapt the final chapter win feels fleeting by comparison with only six missions to its name but theyre also the most spectacular displaying vast combinedarms battles that cover sweeping areas of altis its strongly reminiscent of the opening of operation flashpoint but with you in control rather than being led by an ai squad leader in these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things storywise its also the most interesting segment making unsettling use of its nearfuture setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating whichever direction you take arma 3s campaign is a big powerful deeply engrossing thing but there is one disappointment its lack of vehicular missions since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt there are no tank missions no helicopter missions and no jet missions i can understand why to a point armas vehicles especially its airborne offering take time and effort to learn to control moreover in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway on the other hand flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue and its frustrating that 13 years on armas campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience

this game features a lot more than it may seem its got lots of gamemodes and different experiences even if you do play the same gamemode over and over everytime you play will be a different experience may it be your role the difficulty or the ai its all different every time you can find a lot of funny moments where the game will glitch out on you a bit but its not really gamebreaking its just a moment you can laugh about plus the amount of customization in the game is unbelievable theres so much different changes you can do to the game from changing your characters voice or face up to making a whole addon and even more im not gonna say the games completely perfect though the main problem may be the community but from time to time youll not meet with that problem some people will be nice to you and help you if youre a newbie to the game and some will just go hard on you and troll you but those guys are rare as people dont appreciate them on the servers the gameplay now that is one hard question to answer the gameplay mostly matters about you and the gamemode how you want to play will still be valid but you are restricted to thinking a lot about your actions or youll get shot by some guy from 800 meters while hes only using a simple rifle with no scope as you would guess another problem is the ai sometimes it may act rediculous and sometimes its just the best ai you can find in a game now im not gonna go over the gamemodes here as its better to find out yourselves but ill just say that king of the hill wastelandmostly fun with friends and zeusyoull be most likely to spend days on this one are the ones i recommend the community the community has an endless array of addons you could use to change your game andor experience im not gonna say much about it except this but theres alot you can say about the community the engine this game requires a beefy pccurrently at its state but the engine is brilliant it can run alot of data without having to give you frame drops or hard cpu usage the engine is mostly dependant rather more on the ram than the cpu i recommend atleast 612 ram for this game if youre gonna play it alot overall the games worth a shot for people who like to plan their moves and think about what they do it before they do it altough you will find mostly funny moments and nonserious moments in multiplayer but less than serious moments that are mostly enjoyable certain people refer to this as a walking simulator but the point is that arma iii is mainly focused on infantry and combined arms you will find yourself walking and running alot to objectives but thats how it is in real life too the game is focused on reality and will be a hard challenge for people who arent used to this type of gaming you can find alot to do in this like commanding ai andor players which is always hard at the start and participating in large assaults on towns such as kavala in my opinion arma iii is worth a shot lankercool commander and soldier also regular zeus player in the arma iii community

edit bohemia has been releasing constant updates and stability patches the game is getting better especially with the marksman dlc  deployable bipods and weapon resting make combat so much better  but my previous comment stands i can not justify to anyone who has not played it before at this price this is a game to pick up on a steam sale & its dlc my recommendation  do not purchase it until then unless you are desperately in need of this game edit2 as fair warning  i will be deleting posts that personally attack anyone this is for talking about arma3 not how stupid people are i will delete your post if it is just an emotional response thank you after 1752 hours of gameplay 3 created mods and thousands of written code i can safely say that arma 3 is an incomplete game in its vanilla state i am speaking from a standpoint of someone who has been with the arma series for a long time i expected more from arma 3 and i am dissapointed by its current state the bohemia team is fantastic at postlaunch support and i am glad to see that they are still loving this baby there are several things that still dissapoint me about the arma series that i was hoping to have improved in arma 3 when arma clicks it is an amazing experience that you can not get anywhere else however this does not mean i am blind to its downfalls  and what i was hoping to see improved upon in this series 1confusingcomplicated interactions now i am not saying you cant learn these over time arma has a difficult learning curve that is a little unncessary the interface is just awful want to look through your rifle scope click the right mouse button no click it dont hold it that makes your view zoom in and youll hold your breath oh damn did you controlclick earlier yup that swapped your scope to the little red dot sight on top right click to get back to the regular view now you can controlclick to move the view youll bring up from the dot sight to the scope yes i know theres no way for you to know what view youll bring up before you right click  httpwwwquartertothreecomfp20130925armaiiipushesboundariescombinedarmswarfarepatience 2 ai performance httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzrfhwg7zs the ai are almost brain dead at times i dont expect anything near perfection  but why do ai have to have hack shotting skills to present a challenge ai still lack basic abilities to effectively communicate and move properly the ai also are way more costly on cpu then they need to be  while looking at the ais code  i can post pictures if youd like  a good chunk of their fsms have been deactivated for quite some time when is this going to be fixed in a recent patch bohemia added ai supression in a recent patch this is arma 3 a military simulator where suppression did not exist until recently even with supression ai will only look for cover if it is in within 10 meters otherwise they will just lay down in an open field and either 1 shoot you directly in the face or 2 wait to die ai do not work well in teams and do not coordinate well in combined arms situations apcshelicoptersinfantry can look cool when they work together but it is usually a scripted event or a random chance event ai will not call artillery to help them helicopters will spot enemies but not report it to friendly ai so they can be aware of an ambush and etc the ai is the bare minimum and leaves more to be desired  i could only recommend this game if it was 2530 dollars the game is missing a lot of promised features  but its okay you can get a fraction of them by paying another 15 dollars to get the dlc they released the dlc which has a whopping 2 helicopters yay this games success is built by the community and i view arma 3 as nothing but a platform in which to create things  like lego the ai is terrible the lack of content is terrible the developers woud rather release new v3ss for dayz arma 3 has a better engine than arma 2  but lacks everything else the dlc is helping out with the content problemsbut only if youre willing to pay for what should have been there i honestly dont know what more to sayif youre on the fence about purchasing arma 3 and dont have a group to play with  i would not purchase this game until it goes on sale tldr when this game goes on sale for 10 dollars buy it and its dlc click link below httpsdldropboxusercontentcomu38334795biaigif

game requires several gigabytes of modding to be playable gun sway is obnoxious optical glare is like looking through an instagram beer glass and although in real life soldiers can carry up to 40kg in a firefight the characters lose stamina and said gun sway worsens to musketlevels of pinpoint accuracy not to mention there is actually no stamina bar or notification you simply hear him moan incessently the game is expensive and some of the vehicles and equipment in the game is classed as separate dlcs which you need to buy to pilot or use despite the hefty price of arma 3 you can expect the ratio price of the dlcs to be roughly 20 percent of arma 3s original cost the helicopter dlc for instance contains only two helicopters and a realism mode which worsens your ability to fly for your viewing pleasure they the creators of a military simulator also randomly brought in a dlc that lets you race around in a gokart no i dont know why either you can indeed exchange attachments on weapons except bipods and frontgrips  no one really knows why they discriminated not to mention said bipods serve absolutely no purpose and without a mod you cannot deploy your weapon on any environment be it bipod edge of a window or bonnet of a car the body armour does indeed seem to affect your lethality but again there is no indication anywhere what is more armoured and what is less armoured what weighs more what weighs less many of the futuristic weapons on arma 3 are actually cancelled weapons systems deemed inferior in real life ah99 blackfoot or dont actually exist such as t100 varsuk making the game incredibly peculiar its also extremely difficult to host a server for your friends to play and will require thirdparty software such as a server host plus hamachi or equivelant software the experience is stunningly frustrating and can easily consume three hours of your time learning the games scripting language simply to run the game or create a respawn point queue irritating slurring youtube tutorials by semiconscious d1ckh3ads who cant get to the fuc king point buildings are only superficially destructible they wont crumble but they will undergo scripted morphing turning magically into ruinstanks can also be defeated by a farmers three foot stonewall yes and collisions cause the game physics to dart you away hundreds of metres even in a tank sometimes overrall i would rate this game as being lower than the temperature of outer space arma 2 including its dlcs have major flaws but the replayability is immense and covers actual modern weapons and whilst arma 3 experienced the longest most buggy alphastaging in earths entire gaming history bohemias employees were arrested for espionage because they thought it would be smart to send two work employees on tourist visas for a little bromance coincidently where they were basing altis on and started taking pictures of actual military bases there what the fu ck were they thinking ridiculous ludicrous dont buy this game the iranian soldiers also look like bugmen or bumblebees

very addictive i would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an indepth military sandbox shooter this game does a great job overall of satisfying the thirst for using tactics in combat before i get any farther into this review i would like to point out that this game is nothing like cod or battlefield that doesnt necessarily mean it cant be fast paced but the learning curve for this game can be kind of deep for some im going to focus primarily on general gameplay rather than go indepth with mods overall gameplay 910 this game is often called a walking simulator however this game is so much more than that once you play long enough you just look at walking as another method of travel you start weighing your options as you come into contact with objectivesother players do you want to risk driving to a location only to get blown up by at antitank or would you rather take the longer but mostly safer method of walking once you get yourself in this mindset you really stop caring about how much you have to walk that being said you can see how decisions can ultimately lead to success or failure this is perhaps one of favorite things about this game want to stealthily insert from the sea seal style would you rather set up on a hill 15km away and pick off the enemy or would you rather roll with a battalion of tanks and annihilate everything in your path the decision is ultimately yours you may find that a lot of this isnt in the vanilla game but thankfully the modding community has done an amazing job shaping this game into so much more combat 810  combat is great but it has its problems some very frustrating problems at that pvp combat is always amazing and most of the time it comes down to who has the better tactics however the ai is ridiculous it has gotten better overtime but the ai is completely unpredictable sometimes you can drive up to them and kill all of them without them even getting a shot off or you can be 1km off sitting on a hill with your sniper and start picking them off only to be obliterated by them with ridiculous aim dont let that ruin your experience though some of my favorite moments in this game have to do with the ai doing something completely hilarious ex taking you on a tour of a town in a small hatchback for no apparent reason mechanics 910 falls 2 feet to the ground dies to be fair combat mechanics in arma 3 are much better imo than that of previous arma titles bullet penetration is verrryyyy well done it can easily give you an advantage especially if you have a weapon like the 50 cal lynx that can kill enemies in armored vehicles bullet spreaddrop seems realistic enough if your one of those people like me who wanted sniper mechanics to be real youll be mostly dissappointed but ranging and bullet drop can be compensate a little there are lots of options for movement and stances they can actually benefit you greatly in combat i highly recommend staying away from rocks i have no idea why but rocks can instakilltrap you if your not careful not all rocks are like this mostly just large ones stay away visuals 910 when first playing this game on ultra it can be breath taking for the full experience i would highly suggest wearing some nice headphones and turn up the volume the immersion is very enjoyable if you cant run the game on ultra dont feel left out it still looks great and can often times give you an unfair advantage over players online being able to see through foilagefog theres probably a lot i could add to this review but a lot of the enjoyment comes from mods there are too many good ones to list i may sound a little biased because i love this game so much but if the above that i described sounds remotely like something your interested in then i highly recommend it

the most comprehensive military sim out there setting you loose on a massive island with all of the weapons vehicles and scenarios you could possibly wish for the game itself has remained almost unchanged since the original operation flashpoint released over 10 years ago however of all the iterations arma 3 is the one that has improved things the most these arent big changes but merely small gameplay tweaks that make it feel more polished and smooth graphically its convincing it isnt always beautiful but it gets the atmosphere of a real place just right and the large view distances are key to making it feel alive you can tell that the developers did their homework when researching the island that this game is based on yup it is a real place if you dont know anything about this game the best word to sum it up with would be realistic you are a single soldier in a large realtime conflict you can die from a single bullet or stray shell and alone you have limited influence over how the battle will go expect to be crawling through muddy fields or cowardly hiding behind cover as bullets whiz overhead dont expect to behave like rambo and to survive i wouldnt consider this game complete just yet for months they have been rolling out updates and patches and at the time of writing the main campaign is only 13 released that being said its the community that really supports this game mods like dayz show how flexible and openended the game can be really arma 3 can be seen as offering an island and great multiplayer support letting the community come up with the best content personally i havent spent much time in the largescale multiplayer side of things i prefer playing missions with a friend and those experiences have been enjoyable and memorable expect a single objective to take a while and for it to get rather frustrating as you die through seemingly no fault of your own ive also spent a lot of time simply exploring the large island yup on my own with no npcs or other players i love the sights and sounds i love exploring over the next mountain or lounging about on a beach soaking up the digital rays i dont expect other people to find that fun and neither does the game the fantastic mission editor simply opens up countless opportunities for you and i chose one of the most dull and mundane simply to see how much enjoyment i could extract from it the community is what makes this product what it is theyre serious but loyal and will likely be playing this game for years to come youll make good friends if you behave in a sensible and teamworthy fashion and thanks to the steam workshop support there are thousands of mods and maps to download to boost the number of scenarios the game has to offer buying this game is an investment the developers and community have pledged their loyalty to build it into a musthave title though it could take several years to reach that stage dont expect gameplay thats easy to jump in to nor should you expect a fun standalone experience but this game is no cod by default its not a mainstream game but the possibilities it offers you are almost endless

sad what was once a great simulation has turned into a big middle finger to loyal followers dlcs that should have been released with the original game because lets face it even on release it was still a beta i have followed bohemia since operation flashpoint and i loved their games and their attention to realismarma 3 could have been so much but releasing half dlcs instead of the old good hardy dlcs you use to get with arma 2 and still not fixing glitches i can no longer support this game heck even all the arma clans that switched to arma 3 is suffering membership loss due to the unplayability of this game on multiplayer and thats where this game really shined at one point its a sad day

when you see that i have played this game for like 800 hours you would think i must love this game so then why am i not recommending it well firstly this isnt a game about me marine corps veteran have been playing video games since 1989 love military simulation games pros beautiful graphics check out my screenshots sandbox value moding community the only real reason i am still playing and they are doing it for free and do a better job than the company i paid for this game cons bugsglitchescrashes nightly in the editor never merge sp missions they will never work graphics dont mean much look at minecraft roblox sandbox dont mean much when the tools you are given to enjoy it dont work ie the mission editor having to spend 50 hours of scripting and mission making in order to enjoy an hour of carnage sound horribly done ballistics unreal yes i have actually been shot at and shot back and yes this game is not realistic unit command and control blows hard the absolute worst ai is the worst i have ever seen they put zero effort into it multiplayer is a disaster having to learn a computer language to do what bohemian should be doing campaign cant compare to bf or moh etc why even try to compete with those completely unrealistic and immature approach to war i honestly think these guys are pacifists so why have i been playing it for over 20 hours a week firstly there is nothing else out there bi actually may wake up one day and give us the tools to make this game epic or at least create a tool for us guys who hate scripting make it 100% gui look at the f18 mod amazing easy to use smooth and fast nothing like the mission editor we are forced to use conclusion this is not a video game it is a watered down military training simulator at that training simulator is virtual battlefield 2 httpenwikipediaorgwikivbs2 yes we have been falsely advertised to for years aside from the graphics there is has been zero upgrade to the basic mechanics of operation flashpoint aka arma arma 2 and arma 3 why well i can only guess that bi makes most of its money from vb2 not the games there focus is on the guy who buys the software the military uses and the guy who builds the training blocks scripting each training evolution for the unique team experience the guys who use vb2 have not need to script just the one guy lucky enough to play with vb2 all day so when you look at why this game is terrible it makes sense the ai sucks because vb2 isnt designed to be against an ai opponent the unit training plays against a game master or zeus if you will which leaves guys like me who want to play a game left in the dust solo missions and campaign suck because vb2 is only used for short training periods not a full mission or campaign i have been playing military simulator for far longer than i care to think and this isnt one it has no brain to even compare to the legendary sims of the past m1 tank platoon 2 gunship falcon 30 the mission editor is not user friendly because there is a guy in some cubicle somewhere in some military unit learning code to script the training missions hench why make it easy when you can charge some government huge amounts of cash to train an administrator sounds like microsoft so this is why arma in all of its buggy existence is not a game it was never meant to be a game it was meant to sell to a group of guiney pigs and use them to help make vb2 better so enjoy making all of those mods and scripting code while bi makes a killing off all of your hard free work

positive ive had this game for nearly a year now and i have enjoyed every minute whether it has been on altis life zeus mode sandbox or king of the hill the possibilities are endless for this game because of the unlimited modding capabilities bohemia has provided us with creating missions for your friends and you to enjoy is awesome although the mission editor is a bit hard to use at first this game is for people of all gaming backgrounds as it provides intense infantry game play explosive vehicle game play and the tactical commands that know one knows how to use the use of the third and first person views offer an increased fov and different play style to add also the hud and the menus are very easy to navigate and are user friendly negative the game by design is full of glitches that can be annoying and frustrating the vehicles dont handle as well as you would think with your mouse and keyboard depends what you think also if you have a less than good computer then you may have a hard time running this game above 20 fps over all i strongly recommend getting this game to anyone that has a good pc and enjoys the likes of battlefield and maybe call of duty and anyone that has previously owned a amra game hope this review has been useful and meaningful

arma iii is a good game with a good concept of what it is trying to do they have started to roll out the campaign finally after a few months after realese what helped arma ii was the modding scene and even just the mission files for multiplayer which will further improve the life of this game as this seems to be the direction that arma iii is going and that for one thing is excellent this could spur some very interesting gameplay and i am hoping it would catch on with groups such as shactac or lsg just like in arma ii graphicly the game has improved alot from its predecessor implimenting modern lighting and just looking far superior which may not matter for most people but it is a nice addition for the game now for the downfall not everyone has this but many people do the game has severe problems with performance and not knowing how to utilise cpu and gpu properly httpiimgurcompkwvj34hjpg httpiimgurcomrqog0qfjpg these two screenshots show the utilisation of the game and it is quite clearly awful playing the game at 1025 fps is not possible you are at hinderance when playing with this sort of preformance the bis developers seem like they are trying to avoid this problem moving threads to less noticable places is one of the ways basically just outright trying to get rid of the people complaining this feels like bad practice for the company acting this way towards their paying customers when it comes to problems such as this they seem to respond very badly a similar problem a while ago caused them to reply and they said it is too hard and we are not willing sourcehttpsteamcommunitycomapp107410discussions0864961722019263834  really i do not think they should be developing games if things are going to be to hard for them they are letting down customers and it is a real big shame because this game is really promising finally pros excellent multiroll military sim beautiful graphics imo way smoother than arma ii ex shootingaiming altis and stratis being very versitile and can make for interesting gameplay improved physics with bullets and vehicles the ragdolls cons severe performance issues and utilisation the sound assets could be better that is nothing mods cannot sort game feels incomplete having only a select few vehiclesweapons the campaign only just being rolled out again feeling incomplete thanks for reading edit so i upgraded my pc and have been playing a feck ton of arma recently the sad thing is though my fps never stays above 60fps and i still sometimes even drop below 30fps with such a good pc it is really really depressing that this game is so awfully optimised when i jumping in the editor and get 60fps i see what the game could be they have also now finished the campaign and on the plus side jsrs studios are developing a new version of jsrs that is going to be a must have mod in arma iii for me i am still going to leave this unrecommended on the fact that it does not even seem to have changed despite spending alot of money on a new pc and even buying a watercooler for the cpu so i could overclock it just to find out that i still get bad fps i am playing the game yes i am also enjoying the game but underlying all of that is still disappointment i guess if you like arma ii and you think your pc would be up to it go for it otherwise dont bother again thanks for reading

this game had a whole lot of potential based on the early screenshots but then bohemia squandered it when they completely changed everything about it you can find screenshots jam packed with weapons attachments camos characters and factions that just do not exist in the game solely because bohemia wanted to go another course halfway through development that might have been an accpetable option except bohemia didnt fully commit because of this a lot of the game is just copypasted nonsesne almost all vehicles use the same hmgs gmgs and autocannons with the only difference being the hull of the vehicle all static weapons such as the mortar gpmg and antitankantiair missile launcher are the same in different camos for the different factions theres maybe a total of 15 unique weapons in the game all of which are divided into classes and inside these classes there is no variety an example of this is the mx and katiba these each have their respective variants in the cqb regular grenadier and dmr roles but each one of them is the exact same they have the same ballistics same damage same recoil same magazine capacity even though the mx has a much longer thicker mag than the katiba and hell even the same round take a look back at arma ii youll notice that each faction has their own ups and downs as far as weapons and vehicles go but in arma iii everything feels the exact same and in many cases it is the exact same they couldnt add a different autocannon for each faction but they sure could add six different fedoras and civilian outfits for you to wear another moronic decision on the part of the devs was to place the game in the future without actually adding any futuristic content any and all futuristic content was scrapped early on in the development process and then they started adding things that look futuristic the merkava replaces the m1a2 abrams tank in the least sensible move since jimmy carter running for a second term the bradley is replaced by the namer another israeli tank and come to think of it this entire game is a showcase for israel this doesnt make any sense at all in the current iteration of the game where its spread out amongst all factions but it made a lot of sense in the original story when israel was annexed by csat and csat started using israeli made weapons and vehicles to supplement their sovietmade equipment from yesteryear this is a great example why they shouldve committed to the original story rather than stray away from the original path and create this jumbled mess of a game when you get down to the core of it all all that matters is the gameplay unfortunately that is horrendous too the game feels like they watched rambo on repeat for six weeks straight because instead of combat being fast paced and short lived like it was in in arma ii combat is now based on who is a bigger bullet sponge players can routinely take six or seven shots before dying even two shots to the head sometimes does not kill full auto is now glorified and not using it is almost a sin because if you dont youre going to be the one in a bodybag seriously they took a simulator game and turned it into call of duty the encumberance system is another horrible mess seriously your character is not fit for military shape because he cant sprint for more than 20 seconds in full combat load without needing a five minute break and good luck hitting anything once the enemy has fired a shot in the opposite direction because your guy is apparently in his first firefight and is already reaching for his entrenching tool to dig all the way to china and is shaking harder than michael j fox with a cold another noticable feature of this game is how poorly optimized it is seriously even with a good gaming rig your online experience will be riddled with framerate drops and at times outright freezeframing all in all i would not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the arma series because what you will find is far and away from the usual experience

this game may have amazing gameplay however bohemia interactive thinks its okay to release a game with system requirements that dont even run the game at above 30 fps in a multiplayer environment i have an i7 and a gtx 970 and this game still wants to run at around 15  60 fps in a multiplayer match with above 30 players would not recommend it if your pc can not handle it edit to clarify id like to mention custom gamemodes which are the biggest factor for the low fps i am experiencing gamemodes like altis life stratis life king of the hill where a lot of players are doing a lot of things will contribute to your client side fps however it doesnt matter if you are alone on one side of the map and 60 other players are at the other side the way the engine handles players is the reason why the lag occurs the way multiplayer works in this game is if players are doing things like walking talking in local chat shooting a gun or whatever theyre doing the server has to keep on processing their behavior in almost real time for whatever reason certain gamemodes with a certain amount of players creates horrible lag issues on the server which then affects the users pc to an extreme extent so no this might not happen in standard arma 3 but that still doesnt fix the issues this game has in multiplayer with optimization

played many different fps over the years this is by far the best one keep in mind if you are used to battlefield or other fps this may take a little time to get used to and get the hang of but be patient its well worth it i bought arma 3 for the helicopters and ended up liking the fps aspect just as much as the flying also be sure to try all the differnt game types before you stick to one thing i played sector control for months before trying something else like sandbox or wasteland servers which i enjoyed even more so

its difficult to compare arma to another game since its so unique the gameplay is not your typical shooter as it incorporates strategic elements and doesnt play like a traditional fps console gamers will have no issues with this games controls even as their first shooter on a pc arma has a slight learning curve it may be a little confusing at first until you learn how things work and learn to take cover arma has a lot of little details to gameplay that you can improve upon to give yourself and edge such as the stance adjustment controls but they arent vital for successful gameplay arma is only as complex as you want it to be even though it is a simulation game it feels much more natural to play than other simulations singleplayer  the story is actually pretty good some of the scenarios definitely have a challenging opflashpoint feel to it which im a fan of its divided into 3 episodes with their own chapters each episode giving a new perspective to the conflict and upping the scales of battle theres also a bootcamp minicampaign which will help new players a lot multiplayer and community  arma is a great game to play alone its even better together theres lots of public servers with a variety of gamemodes that you can just jump into lots of awesome custom scenarios too such as the coop scenario invade and annex as well as the pvp scenarios such as koth and wasteland but the best experience is playing with an organized group there are casual coop groups pvp clans as well as hardcore roleplaying milsim units you can feel around for whats right for you editor  arma has always had a very powerful mission editor tool and has open support for custom scripts this alone is all we needed to make missions then bi gave us zeus  an ingame editor look up some videos  this alone will entertain you for hours by yourself now bi has also promised a 3d mission editor to cover even finer details mods  the game is advertised as a military simulator and it does a great job of that just asis but really its whatever you want it to be and you can deepen the simulation aspects with user content the community is actively pumping out amazing mods for this game and bi has always been highly supportive of community content even to the point of cash giveaways from the make arma not war competition if you can think of something cool to add to arma its probably already got a download link criticism  although the game engine gets some flak for being unoptimized bi has been improving on the games performance significantly when you think about it how many game engines have this kind of attention to detail in such a wide scope of gameplay you can be infantry even fight underwater with certain assault rifles skydivehalo jump pilot a transport chopper fly a jet drive a tank use artillery anything not to mention the detail of the environment even to the starmap what other game can you think of tracks the temperature the ground depending on time of day and when last it rained therefore affecting your thermal optics yea thought so dlc  arma 3s dlc is optional and you can just get modded content which are not affected even if you dont buy the dlcs youll get the improvements to the game and still be able to play with anyone who hasdoesnt have dlc just wanted to clear up the myths of arma 3s dlc ive been playing since the alphabeta with 1000 online hrs and im still not bored arma 3 and arma overall as a series has come a long way and has improved tremendously and bi listens and improves from community feedback arma games have a long lifespan and there are a lot of people just buying it now its been almost 2 years since the alpha was released and expect arma 3 to be active for at least another 35 years probably more think about it why buy a bunch of other games when arma can be all of them for one price definitely the most wellspent money ive ever spent on a game for the enjoyment ive gotten so far and will continue to have no doubt about it im glad i could support such an awesome studio keep up the great work bi

arma 3 is a lot of fun i say this as someone who enjoys the following elements in games that i devote a lot of time to extensive detailed cooperative play and realismimmersion if youre going to arma looking to play the next counterstrike or whatever youre going to walk away disappointed arma is more of a simulator than a casual shooter and yes there is wasteland which is basically a worldwide deathmatch sandbox and arma 2 had dayz which lets face it is also a boring deathmatch sandbox with the inclusion of zombies but to get the most out of an arma game you need to approach it for its strengths  the simulation aspect you can play solo as a member of a squad depending on the mission  finding good missions can be a little tricky or command ai using some nontraditional but with some practice easy to understand commands and play it like more of a strategy game in multiplayer coop is king in my opinion but you can have large scale teamvsteam pvp which is a lot of fun as well i admin a server that runs a largescale coop mission 247 and it never fails to impress and challenge because the ai is smart enough in arma games to allow for emergent gameplay  theyll flank theyll fall back theyll improvise and its different every time and you have to think the engine takes some getting used to compared to the average shooter but arma 3 specifically is far less buggy than other bohemia games have been being different isnt a reason in and of itself to dismiss it though if youre used to other games or approach it like a shooter you might be annoyed with it but if you give it time and learn it and i cant stress enough how important it is to play a good mission in a coop setting to get the most out of it its hard to put down some of the best gaming experiences ive had have been a product of this game engine in coop with dozens of other people and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot treat it like a strategy game or simulation that has shooting involved not like a counterstrikeofdutyfield alike also steam sale so why the hell not

cannot and will not stop playing logged over 850 hours and still going strong the game never had a lot going on for a while but with all the fine tweeking bohemia have done and are still doing which in turn is allowing some really fantastic mods to either port over form arma 2 or ones that are completely new come onto the scene with all the current dlc and the marksman dlc on its way plus the winners of make arma not war announced there has never been a better time to get on and get stuck in whether its life youre into base building on wastelandepoch or just blowing and shooting the hell out of stuff on king of the hill if zombies is your thing try breaking point these being the most popular  if you cannot find something you like then you are doing it wrong but i will not sugar coat it too much but it can be a steep learning curve for those new to the game and yes there are performance issues for some and it can be a challenge for some rigs but the game is still good at 30fps or dare i say it even 25from personal experience there are many forums with tips tweeks and setups that can help you get the most from your arma experience it may take a little bit of time but it is worth it

this is a game with unlimited opportunities and the only limit is your imagination its a oneofitskind game that has no equal if you are able to forgive its flaws which do become less with each patch and there has been a lot of development going on you will get a game that will keep you hooked for years

arma 3 is everything that i have ever wanted within a simulation shooter i purchased it in alpha and i was completely unaware of the amount of gameplay possibilites you can go all out and recreate a real life scenario with the simplified editor layout you could roleplay on one of many open world servers or you could just jump on a coop server and use teamwork to destroy your enemy i had never played an arma game until now and i have no regrets whatsoever for purchasing arma 3 in alpha and watching the game progress as it has you would be a fool to not buy this game during any type of sale the reason i really love this game is because it incorporates three of my favorite games from years ago those games being choplifter arma 3 has an amazing 3d version with so many more options and settings and you can carry actual players and fueldamageammoah so good the first game i played some guy was screaming at me to get in the chopper and as we arrived to the lz i heard the pilot say good luck guys and i was completely blown away i thought that it was an ai pilot the second black hawk down for pc from like 99 the pvp is so much similar but way better last but not least battlezone2 that was my favorite game of all time as a kid with custom base building and defending your base i recommend finding a community as soon as you get into arma 3 you will instantly become immersed into the game with a full community of people from all around the world arma 3 is a great action packed shooter with lot of simulation aspects a ton of different gamplay styles and gametypes and a great place to make friends that will take you to a new level in the steam community more friends more fun win win and the mods end of story see you in the battle soldiers be sure to get it before 2015 rolls around make arma not war is going to add so much and i have high hopes for the future of arma 3

undoubtedly a vast improvement from arma 2 in terms of the new engine animations and such its just a shame this game is set in the near future which isnt exactly my cup of tea but nevertheless the game is constantly getting frequent updates and is a solid military sim that i would highly recommend

probably one of the best games i have ever played it is communitydriven and has a lot of content and a lot of contentcreator tools if you like that like i do workshop integration is amazing and besides the amazing mod dayz breaking point which is big step up from the arma 2 mod trust me it is the best thing since glazed donuts get it if you like shooters get it if you like games

gonna start off by saying the game itself is great the series is moving in the right direction or so i thought developers not just bis are only out for money these days i started to love arma 3 then i see the ridiculous dlc attached to this game who in the  thought it would be a good idea to create a couple of helicopters and some sniper rifles and ing pawn them off to the community are we gonna get to a point where games companies create a shell of a game and ing sell the sky as dlc or each individual vehicle that should have been in the game from the start are we already there

so im in a wedged formation with my team moving through the woods in the middle of a sunny day im caring a heavy load of gear i pant and gasp as i struggle to wade quickly through the grass as i carry many grenades on my back thats not the most of my worries though my team and i are planning to back up a team to attack and control gina a village just up the forest my co talks urgently through his radio jacksonjackson do you read whats your location the team leader panics and exclaims we push on with the mission even though the second team will not respond we pull around a corner and find ourselves trapped between two ridgelines a collection of friendly bodies lay infront of us damnit jacksons down doc go check on him the rest of you covering fire its a scenario that is frequently played out in many shooters although in this scenario it was different we had the disadvantage we were trapped and the enemy was hundreds of meters away from us we could not tell where the bullets where coming from and we had to stay down low and hope we werent hit this is realistic combat probably the best ive played even in a game that seems like a buggy glitchy and poorly made simulator i felt far more immersed then every other war game ive played the graphics for such a large scale in this game are stunning compared to arma 2 the movement lighting and weapons systems are all vastly improved the sheer amount of content such as mods and other tools and missions in this game are vast and i feel like it was perfectly worth the 60 dollars i dumped on it this game is possibly the best war based video game ive played

ive never encountered a better military simulation game it goes beyond shooter when played with a good realism cooperative group with some good missions excellent title

arma 3 definitely brought a lot of improvements from the previous installment of the series the visual element is the best example if you have a good enough computer you can admire the beautiful scenery of altis & stratis the map is even bigger than before the single player campaign is interesting enough it keep me entertained although it was difficult until i learned the controls and the stamina conditioning the cons are still the same for me too many controls to learn and master as i believe that the game would benefit from way simpler controls and the confusing  somewhat buggy squad of bots that you must control on the single player mode i know this doesnt bother the multiplayer aspect but it did bother on the campaign as they didnt obey certains which all more difficult but i most certainly recommend arma 3 because its a great military simulation for those interested in such and it also can be whatever you want just download the mod that suits you best 710

after building on their signature game engine bohemia has truly put forward a simulation gem with arma 3 that no other game franchise has even come close to matching this is where you hit the dirt and find that bullets arent all warning shots and that the blood on your face cant be waited out but that bullets will kill you and that youll have to wipe that blood off yourself while it still isnt the most stable engine a game has run on its the most advanced one i know of with all the trimmings of environment that effect the battle and without all the crashes of battlefield 4 bohemia has brought the arma series to its highest point ever and its playability has been increased 200% i cant reccomend this game to everyone but theres one great lesson learned in my time with arma ive ended missions in other games seemingly covered in blood wearing a bandana and sporting no shirt but instead a big sculpted chest and a bfg in each hand and yet id rather i could just make it home with a mission well done and all of my team safe and sound this is what arma is its fighting a real fight where you have to pace yourself and hold your breath where a bullet in the face can kill a man regardless of whether hes controlled by a player or an ai its using your map intel and wits to determine the best angle of attack on an enemy position and sighing in relief when you find out later that you picked a good entry point its being truly tense when you lie hiding in the bushes hoping the mrap with a gmg turret didnt spot you when its lights passed over you and hoping that you can get everyone home safe at the end of the day hundreds of hours into this game i have yet to be bored even on the most patiently conducted sniper missions theres a satisfying reward in every mission in this game and maybe thats because you really have to work to make it out alive seriously put on your boots because as far as a game goes this is as close as it gets this is arma and there is nothing else like it valtros

arma2 has much more content and is far more realistic only medic can heal and it takes a while weapons acting as real life counterparts in arma3 everything is balanced and you can selfheal in 3 seconds by clicking a proper button arma2 has also more vehicles more weapons more everything really there is nothing to go for arma3 except a bit better graphic but this is hardly anything important especially because arma2 looks not much worse moreover its been over three months since the release date and the game still has unfinished campaign and terrible ai bugs you dont have to take my word for it watch a video httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid178199064

its arma with a facelift honestly i wish there was more to the game i know its alpha and more will be added  but its the stuff ive already seen which are bothersome physics engine still totally broken still using that godawful proprietary sqf scripting language which makes me want to kill myself i know theres supposed to be some java integration in the future but thats not exactly a step up and it most likely wont replace the sqf but will rather become an addition to it there is some really cool stuff though the helicopters are really fun to operate and you have a ton of new stances you can use to your advantage to find a sweet spot while taking fire its worth buying for the price for sure but im a little sad they havent improved the core more nor does it look like they will in the beta or final release

before you decide to downvote this review because its a negative recommendation please read there are positive things about this game if you take your time to read this andor the comments ive posted below bohemia have gone down hill even if their game has enhanced somewhat its not worth anywhere near the price they sell it at and the fact that you have to pay for small updates they call dlcs is disgusting i completley regret buying this game weve payed a bunch of greedy frauds the modding community could do better and their downloads are free this is both disrespectfull to the average player and the modding community its like a go  yourself outlook on the whole consumer market of arma titles whilst i used to be a follower of arma titles i refuse to accept the fact that bohemia are too ignorant to pay some kind of respect to the community its beginging to look like a move ea would pull youve brought our game for a overlyexpensive amount of money and now that we release content that should have been present in the alpha version is now being released late so we can rip you off even more then we did before this has completley ruined the positive vibes that i once had for bohemia disgracefull

i tried to enjoy this game but i could not i have several aspects id like to point out to make clear why i dont recommend buying this game 1  a totally unoptimized engine the graphics in this game are great no doubt about that but the engine and the fps i am getting definetely are not my pc has uptodatecomponents which do meet the recommend requirements except for my graphics card it is a gtx 760 recommended one is a gtx 680 though i accept that i cant get the best amount of fps with this card in a a game like arma 3  but only 27 fps max in a multiplayer match with  10 people online and the graphics settings at low view distance set to 1000 and with shadows deactivated this is not a fault of my 760 it is because the engine of this game is totally unoptimized 2  an ai which is dumb as f i expect that the ai in a game that is based so heavily on teamwork is atleast acceptable but this is not the case in arma 3 no the ai of the comrades you will lead during several singleplayer missions is so bad that i would need to look for a word to describe it they resist to follow your orders instantly for example when you tell them to enter a car they will walk around like a headless chicken before finally remembering that there is a car they should enter and if youre unlucky they wont enter the car at all this is just one exmaple but there are many cases where the ai would have to be improved maybe in arma 4 which i certainly wont buy if they keep their attitude towards the game and the players like in arma 3 3  terrible mission design there are several missions which do just have terrible design for example a mission where you have to make your way through a destroyed town with tons of enemies vehicles which i couldnt use for some reason and barely any supplies but this is not the only case there are several other missions with a bad design where you maybe have to walk for several minutes or run to keep up with your mate and then encounter an enemy squad but you cant hit any of them because your level of fatigue is too high so that your hands shake and cant aim as you would need too sure it might be realistic but here it is just gamebreaking luckily there is a way to skip a mission hold down shift and  on your numpad and then type endmission you can release shift and  while typing and i am thankful for this option because i was stuck forever with this one particular mission but lets move on 4  small things that could have been better there are some small things aside from the big ones that coould have been better if the developers would have taken more time to improve the game for example the body armor in the singleplayer depending on what pieces of armor youre wearing you get an armor rating which you cant see anywhere and the amount of shots you can tolerate before dying depends on that rating sometimes i would just die from one shot and no it wasnt the 408 ct or the 99x108mm 50 that hit me and wonder why i died although i was wearing armor note that i am talking of the singleplayer and the enemy did take like 4 shots to kill seems like my armor rating was not high enough but how should i know see the problem is that you cant know because nowhere is written how good that armor is it wouldve been nice if they would have given every piece of armor a value like 0 for no protection 4070 for decent protection and 100 for high protection they should have also provided checkpoints for campaign levels well you can save manually bu if you forgot to and die well you will be kinda annoyed when you have to do the whole mission again and let me tell you that the missions are not short ones but there are also good things about the game the graphics are beautiful and if you have a high amount of fps im sure that the multiplayer provides alot of fun thee are also so many vehicles from tanks to submarines artillery jets choppers attack boats there is also an option to make time passing by faster press the key to the left of backspace to increase times speed and the button left to this one to decrease times speed especially useful when you have to walk forever againand another aspect i like are the realistic ballistics of the guns depending on their ammunition type but cave_dovah you wrote that u dont like it when u die from one shot seems like u have no idea and are not trustworthy no wait i wrote that i did not like the system with the armor rating but the ballistics should stay like they are because what would a military simulator be without realistic ballistics i think that everyone should decide on their own whether they buy this game or not i just tried to help you and hope i succeeded with this choice by writing about the negative aspects since there are enough reviews already which cover the good ones enough i personally regret to have bought this game mostly because of the fps i am getting although i am close to the recomended requirements but hey thats just my opinion

this game has turned from something with potential in a big bag of festering feces but the worthless immature underage scum that represents the customers doesnt even know better of course like all arma games it is a military sim unlike arma 2 or the great operation flashpoint 1 where most features infantryvehicleair vehicle worked pretty well here you have a bit from everything but nothing is polished or smooth to be honest the only difference from the beta that we preorderers had access to ages ago are some new vehicles and weapons not even that many that it would matter the animations stutter and the vehicle driving and physics at all are a joke which is all due to poor coding the only thing that is good is the singleplayer campaign but after all this is a military sim which is meant to be played in multiplayer i dont want to play against the ai first of all because the arma ai has and always will be horrible and secondly because i want to play against other players and not placeholders the multiplayer is pretty much unplayable as well and its not getting better 7090% of all populated servers are roleplay servers running the life mod the other 1030% are a tiny bit of survivalsandboxdeathmatch wasteland servers and some foreign community servers running tons of mods i also dont want to download 10 gigabytes of unneccesary third party community mods and try installing them for 4 hours because i neither want to garbage my computer up nor do i find unneccessary and poorly made mods needed to play the game  the steam workshop i find it ridiculous how they praise their revolutionairy new game mode called zeus and then dont even make official servers with that game mode or others for the players available what i preordered a year  ago some overhyped successor game of arma 2 that pretended to have every feature work in progress and to be something completely new once the features are done what i got after all features are supposedly done arma 2 poorly converted into a new engine with new animations a ridiculously bad physics engine and unfinished unpolished features i feel ripped off and am very angry at the devs i will not buy a game from those lying lazy and greedy aholes again if anyone related to the dev team reads this i hope you feel proud contribooting to the cancer that is killing the video game industry

so i played this game when it was free for 3 days and i only played it for a little while first of all the game was not very well optimized and i found it to be pretty laggy especially in multilipayer with around 50 people playing and bullets and missles going everywhere i thought that this was a really releastic game becuase of just how many people there are in a game and how its like a big fire fight i would have to say for people who have lots of money to spend on games go ahead and buy it if you have a gaming machiene that can handle this game and get playable frame rates recommend an $1000 pc minimum but if you play free games like me and dont have an extreme pc build i dont really recommend the game that much

i really hate to say this but you should wait to get this game until bis gets it finished assuming that happens the reader should realize that i have almost 2000hrs in arma2 the 600 or so listed on my profile here is just since it got added to steam and doesnt count the time presteam so as someone who plays exclusively with friends on listen servers not on big public servers as someone who plays mostly cti maps remember those bis and as someone who spent most of those almost 2000hrs flying cas in a jet remember those bis i can honestly say that im rather let down by arma 3 and it makes me very sad the interface has always been clunky from way back in ofp and before the new backpack system seems to me to just be a reskin of the same thing it does indeed make it a bit easier to use being able to drag and drop stuff novel and while i appreciate the work hereid rather have seen the time spent on other things to be fair two of the devs did spend time locked up in greece for a stupid reason i think it was 11 months this is something that is strictly forbidden to speak of on their forums for some odd reason but i understand this had a huuuuuuge impact on their development cycle as it was their two lead devs as i understand it i get the feeling that they got back and shoved development through in order to compete with the then new bf and cod releases i personally feel this was a huge quivering pile of mistake becausethey arent really in competition with those games itd be like saying that chess competes with checkers and monopoly all board games sure but vastly different same here arma ii was all about trying to make the game more of a military simulator though i think they had to admit some limitations here and there with the tech of the day without making the engine only playable on super computers arma iii seems to go away from this and i think its trying to compete even more now with those other games in some waysmaybe im wrong it just doesnt feel like the team is as worried about realisim any longer for me the fact that its set in 2035 is a hhhhuuuuuuuge turnoff and almost a game breaker right there that and theres one jet in the game thus farone and its some old trainer pos to bootnicewell guess this confirms my hunch ive had for a while now bis seems to hate fixed wing like blizzard hates melee its all about rotary wing which is fine and dandy unless you need an a10 or a spooky by 2035 we assume naturally that these have been phased out so where are their replacements hell at this point id be happy with an f15 that i can just fly and do standoff attacks with from miles awayoh right thats what the choppers are for am i ranting a bit there um yes sorry but i was just looking so foward to this game heck i even did the preorder on the delux version now ya im kinda not happy about that i fire the game up now and then after i see an update downloading just to mess around with the undrivable pickups and do target practice with the assault rifles that have recoil like a 45110 every shotits like going to the playboy mansion only nobodys there so id say to wait on this game im still playing armaii where i can fly fixed wings even in the base game oh yes i knowmods mods modsya hangs head

poor edition to the armaverse tons and tons of potential that is being sadly wasted the game has nice graphics and lighting albeit not dx11 the main island altis looks quite impressive indeed but has a very empty feeling and doesnt feel alive like other arma maps did the ragdoll which is one of the new features feels half finished like the rest of this game if im honest an example of this is all static 50cals have the same model and this situation you will see through out the game the latest content added were reskined with slight model change baf helicopter and vehicle which is unacceptable in book if you already payed for that content if you bought baf for arma 2 the sound leaves very little to be desired with clipping audio and samples so loud that they actually break up tank main guns arma and arma2 have infinitely better programmed sound engines arma3 is currently a dead duck in my opinion anything that is positive about this game is quickly over shadowed by lack of content bugs inconsistances in code and i hate to say it but bordom i never thought id hear myself saying it but yes this game is boring with the pace of the games meaningful development slower than a snail id venture to say dont expect much soon maybe if the game still lives in 2015 it could be great but right now it is certainly not that only time will tell if bis take advantage of this games potentials my feeling is that it will fall by the wayside because of lost potential and lack of real core code bug fixes

oh arma arma arma arma the abusive relationship we have shared over the past 4 games has become more abusive and less fun and all it took was one title one title full of empty promises and most likely just a tech demo to fix the engine up for dayz 2 let me elaborate on my disdain for what used to be one of my favorite game series and the company that i used to respect above every other the quick and dirty would i recommend arma 3 not by a mile sub30 price tag sure youll get your monies worth but even for all the modders trying to save it this is not a complete game you should not have to pay 60 dollars to go and download a number of community created additions to feel like you actually have a full fledged product if some of that money went to those modders then id say support them not bi but it doesnt imagine buying a car but having to go out and purchase the doors and steering wheel separately sure the car runs but just how useable is it a quick glance at my steam page would reveal that i highly praised bis adventurous approach to arma 2 and oa i loved arma with a blazing passion even though its considered the  of the series ofp shared a warm place in my heart as the birth of one of my favorite milsims sure since ofp the series has had its caveats and nuances but you quickly learned to take them with the massive amount of fun the games provided so where did arma 3 go wrong what could one title do to tear my respect for 3 other games  2 expansions & dlc well lets start with the company and work our way up you see riding on the heels of the massive success that dayz was thanks to word of mouth and lps bi somewhere seems to have got it in their head that the same business practices most aaa companies do incomplete games for full price dlc strategies could be done to their small communities and you know what they were right we all bought into it bi slowly came to realize that they could do less work and still make more money because their communities could turn nowhere else what amazes me most about dayz besides the fact that it is still in alpha after almost 2 years and that its lead creator left is that all it really did was show what arma 2 was already capable of massive persistent worlds with milsim themes just with zombies but this is not a review of dayz this a review of arma 3 any arma community member worth his or her grain of salt will remember all the broken promises that now lay at arma 3s feet disguising as the enemy gone the railgun tank one of the coolest features at e3 and the only one making the future worth giving a damn about poof all the underwater showcases hinting at perhaps real naval gameplay nope planes we got 3 funny thing is all you deluxe edition owners should open up that tactics techniques and procedures manual it comes with sometime and view all the planes we should have had the reskinned c130 and f35 fugetta about it thats right we couldnt even get recycled content now let me be fair arma 3s engine is a massive improvement over previous series entries and ofparma has always been one of those games where the community really takes it the final step with endless content but vanilla the games were usually very playable and very enjoyable this is where arma 3 comes up the shortest while the engine is great and getting better with each patch not only are we still denied even a basic amount of content but the underlying issues since ofp are still there 20132014 we still have an action menu bi please not to mention that ai has somehow found a way to get worse with all these improvements rather than better you know some people actually say arma 2 people were spoiled because we had ofp and arma 1s content all rolled into one i find it hard to give sympathy to the people whose job it is to create content and games who get paid for it in closing i will say this arma 3 as a game is complete and total bs arma 3 as a platform for people to show their skills in modeling texturing and coding fantastic if you want arma 3 do it to support people who make great content just dont expect a full fledged game for the full fledged price

realism really this review pertains to the campaign enemies you hit jump three feet in the air pop just to let you know you hit them wtf a running simulator often enough but you are winded after running for 2030 seconds really am i a soldier in this game or a lazy  gamer dont remind me i am the latter please an interface so clunky and barely explained in the prologue you will find yourself googling how tos again and again you really will feel like a lazy  gamer who ended up in a military situation well done gunfire sounds seem to come from the spot where the bullets landed not where they were fired from passing enemy helicopters never seem to see youcall in a squad to engage you ai squadmates run off without you to engage the enemy despite having no ammo while you are trying to loot bodies for anything useful ai squadmates often get tired if you havent killed an enemy and grenade his  from quite a distance which is nice but after it happens a few times you realize you arent learning anything the impromptu basecamp in the campaign mentioned it had an armory nice except command for some reason placed the armory outside of camp on a table like some peddler and not inside the base where such assets would be actually safe i guess that was my problem i expected realism to boot the game has been around since june 25 2013 and yet the campaign they developed goes from boring to running simulator to incredibly difficult and is over very quickly it stands to reason i suppose since from release they game has felt more like a massive modding toolset than a game released for playing at least the old operation flashpoint shooters though buggy largely unmoddable and hard as hell had a semblance of a campaign and the ability to issue orders to your squadmates here you are along for the ride frustrating in most cases laughable for the rest

this is the worst optimised game i have ever seen in my entire life not only does the frame rate stick around 25 and below but even when i put the graphics on low windowed 1024 x 768 it stays the same around 25 fps i have a great gaming rig and i just can not enjoy this game sometimes i joined a game and it stuck around 10fps dont waste your money

great graphics gameplay is pretty realistic that being said this is 1 of the worst games i have ever played the training teaches less than half of the controls trying to find out how to do things like healing are frustrating and while dying due to ignorance you have to start over on a mission every time you die due to  you telling you basic game controls is for  the game would be awesome if the programmers thought training had its uses

alright i play arma 2  complete edition and i want to compare these as this is supposed to be a great sequel to start off the first look at this game for me was something amazing the game is stunning it is and the maps are totally gorgeous but when i got more into the game i found out that there is extreme lack of more content the game gives you just basic weapons and vehicles just small ammounts of them and allows you to spend another 20 dollars on dlcs that add just a bit of content not like arma 2 that gave you a lot of items etc right away for an awesome price alright its not a major problem lets ignore it for a second now the gameplay itself the game is definitely much easier to orient in and the new loadout system is really awesome there is a problem trought the game itself suffers from some bugs even after the release and the ragdolls dont make any sence the game itself is not worth the money you can pay for it and bohemia doesent seem to try and develop it more they just release more dlcs the ai improved it did but not a lot considering its already 7 years from arma 2 release and arma 2 has pretty ok ai now the campaing i did got a bit into it but i dont feel like its actually worth it playing it if you are here for the reason arma series is so popular  army simulator  the game is no longer a great simulator as bohemia decided to make this game in future now for the future thing there is actually not a lot of futuristic content as most vehicles and weapons are used in the army right now the game cannot be called a simulator if it has futuristic stuff in it now models etc the game does look great and has excellent textures the problem is that offor looks like some aliens what the hell is that bohemia if you compare some of the vehicles of all factions together you will find out that they most of the time just have another textures bohemia you are being lazy here  maps maps are the best thing along with graphics in this game maybe the only 2 good things they look awesome are high res and really excellent no problem here whatever  graphics the game looks stunning no problem with that the game is ok optimized but it uses only max 2 cpu cores if you have a lot of units it will lag horribly gpu optimization is ok dlcs horrible the dlcs have just a few things and they cost a lot not a good thing physics the ragdolls dont make any sense when you shoot someone in the head with a 50 sniper rifle it should knock him back a bit nope he just falls dont like you would hit him with a arrow the car physics are ok but the tanks have some problems you can make tanks fly if you crash 2 of them together final verdict i expected a lot from this game i did not get what i payed for at all there is not enought of content the whole futuristic idea is bad and the dlcs are horrible the game looks great but doesent run well the game was a horrible mess in alpha they fixed the biggest bugs the game feels like a unfinished development concept i hope if ever arma 4 comes out its going to be back in this time not in future i recommend you arma 2 complete edition if you want a great army simulator this is not one if i would look at this game in the perspective from a guy that never played arma game i would say its 810 but i played arma already i am going to give it 6510 i do not recommend this to anyone that wants a realistic war game i reccomend this game to anyone that wants to see something new apart from classic fps games so thank you for reading this long review i hope you agree with me tell me if anything is wrong i will fix it  have a nice day

they keep releasing 15 dollar dlc when the game still has the same bugs as arma 2 i cannot reccomend a game that the developers dont want to optimize or bugfix do not buy this game the developers do not care about releasing content or bug fixing issues for free that have existed since the game was in early access alpha the game is still unfinished it runs at 30 fps on gtx 970 with and i7 processor you phase through walls and your character gets stuck on everything i have 980 hours on arma 2 go check for yourself this game can go  off

despite many warnings from the community bohemia decided to do the right thing and shove their thumb up their butts and not work off of a decent engine again thus resulting in 90 fps in single player down to 10  15 in multiplayer servers cant even handle all the scripts that their idiotic owners apply to said server resulting in massive jam to be applied on your end of the game instead of fixing the ai glitches and trying to optimize the game bohemia has decided to pump out new content that adds to the previous issues stated above whats that you want single player oh well youll have to wait for them to finish pumping out those sp episodes why yes they are free as they should be as you have just paid for a $60 dollar alpha oh and the only thing people play in this realistic army sim is a god damn rpg average civi game type where you role play your actual boring life

i gave this a shot over the free weekend and heres what i learned 1 you need an incredibly modern and powerful gaming pc to run attractive graphics with this my system is 5 years old 570 gtx can barely run this at the lowest graphics settings possible and thats barely getting 30 fps 2 the amount of key mapping you need to do to make this even somewhat manageable as a game is insane basically you need one of those 7 or 9 button gaming mice because you wont have enough sensible keyboard key locations to cover all of the crap 3 for a game where voice communication is extremely necessary the voice comm functionality in this game is quite limited but thats not really an issue because everyone is going to be using ts3 anyway 4 good luck finding a decent server to play on most of them are run by fascist bronys others are run by incompetent admins and you can count on getting spawnkilled by your own team over and over until you leave and find a different server no im not kidding 5 the game isnt worth 60 dollars the rest of the game thats right you dont actually get the whole game for 60 dollars you need all of the dlc too because the only good weapons are locked is going to run you even more so its over $100 game that isnt worth playing unless you have a $2500 computer and a $120 mouse 6 it seems like if you met all of the requirements above the game could be enjoyable just know what you are really getting yourself into

i played this game back when it was the free game for the weekend i never purchased it afterwards and youll probably figure out why from both my review and those of others so as anyone could reasonably expect i was pretty excited for this game to be free for the weekend as ive had my eye on it for almost a year as an avid arma ii fan i had always been a little dissapointed with the lack of more modern military tech in an otherwise great game i thought arma 3 would whisk all my problems away and carry me into arma heaven it didnt quite work out like that though so upon launch the first thing that struck me as odd was the lack of info sure the menus are much more appealing to the eye but the tutorials were some weird lovechild of a campaign and a questsystem it was very strange so much so that i neglected to finish the first one oh well i thought ive played enough arma ii to figure out how to handle myself and for the most part i was right i jumped into the campaign and it was fun so why the negative review well the campaign was fun for a little bit but after that new game smell wore off it wasnt much to brag about i moved on and played some tank match which i cant remember too many details about other than a few key things first off everything was insanely grey now i understand the use of dynamic lighting and warzone fog and stuff like that but this was just rediculous so as i was cruising around with my platoon of slammers we encountered some enemies great lets see how this works so to sum that up theres unique and dynamic damageddead unit models depending on their style of demise the radio chatter no longer sounds like a panicking android but a much cleaner soldier and vehicle control is no longer a reinactment of the mountain scene in tokyo drift but what i couldnt get over was the lack of diversity oh look slammers hey more slammers oh a wolverine i think and omg another slammer what im getting at is that unlike its predicessor arma 3 has no vast gamechanging dlcs other than karts but that isnt even military so what you end up with is this massive tropical island turned warzone and you get the same handful of units over and over which might not matter for ais but for myself i prefer a diverse choice in my vehicles and other wartime equipment sure its modable but so was arma ii and i already know the cool mods for that which totally redefine the feel of the game so over all better lighting and physics better voices and immersion diverse factions newer tech to toy around with low diversity of units poor tutorials for those who want to start at the top modernized everything even when unnecessary eg hummingbirds its such a pointles change just give me my little bird virtually no dlcs that expand the battle experience and the ones that exist arent worth the cost for the amount of units recieved essentially a more stabil version of a modded arma ii client overall i would just reccomend saving the money for other stuff theres plenty of games on steam but none of them not even arma 3 can match the charm and pure flexibility of arma ii

campaign is awful i understand that only giving you one user save per mission makes you rely on being smart about how you approach certain objectives but when your ally ai are dumber than rocks it makes things really difficult and almost impossible in some instances i understand they might not be programmed to know how to clear a room or use bounding to move up but it would be nice if when i order them to move 100m front to cover they would do that as opposed to moving backwards 300m and laying in the prone also when you are assaulting an objective 200m in front of you and you give them specific targets to shoot they instead choose to engage the two guys on the opposite mountain 500m away lets also not forget what im assuming is a bug where even after clearing an area they refuse to move in anything other than a low crawl makes it difficult when your next objective is 500m away i wanted a game where the idea wasnt you have to do everything by yourself but obviously thats not the case in addition to crappy ai there are other bugs that make the game absolutely miserable when attacking a lookout tower you can shoot the guy in the head a couple times toss 3 grenades into it and yet if you get within 10m of it an enemy laying in the prone up there will phase his gun through the floor and kill you before you even try to move into it and clear it if those bugs were fixed it would actually be an enjoyable game but having to restart from the last checkpoint where you have to walk 15 min to the next area only to get killed by a glitch gets really old really fast

a lot of people lead reviews by saying this game has potential which is a really polite way of admitting that right now it absolutely sucks it also does not reflect well on the game or on segments of its fanbase that welldeserved criticism is met with accusations of being a call of duty fan or a console kiddy or other supposed slurs on the critics intelligence ive been playing this series since flashpoint and yknow its always been bugridden poorly implemented and heavily dependent on its modders to even be playable but the series has been just good enough to be worth the aggravation and massive timesink necessary to make it work until now the ai is horrible for a game that involves realism in combat where damage is more realistic and is dependent on squad tactics the ai needs to be competent if not excellent instead the ai is incapable of navigating the terrain without getting stuck incapable of responding effectivly to fire and totally lost inside of buildings  no literally lost inside god help you if your ai decides to use a grenade because hell just kill himself the action menu is still in the game and has been combined with environmental add actions that are even worse than in previous games face a door and click the action menu key now watch as you transition to your handgun instead of opening the door because the action triggers are inconsistently placed by an incompetent dev team this has been a major problem since ofp and its actually worse now you will lose many many many games not because you made a mistake or were unlucky or for legit gameplay reasons but because the ai is totally and i mean totally incapable of doing what the game depends on it to do the devs have taken to claiming arma 3 is a toolbox when theyre not insisting its a game not a simulation or conversely that its actually a simulation not a game what they call their game depends on which set of their errors youre pointing out in defense of it lacking a campaign fine but what you get for tools is laughable theres a handful of armor vehicles and equipment but its basically just reskinned copyandpastes between factions basically everyone shares assets with superficial cammo differences did you think arma 2 had bad optimization well the dev team topped itself with arma 3 being even clunkier slower and more bloated seriously everything about this gamesimulation when it comes to optimization looks like a rough draft of code rather than a finished product it will slam even highend machines to a halt because of poor usage routines bad scripting and other lazy shortcuts what about mods well the modding community is a brilliant one weve got some really really good people who really should get credit for making arma remotely popular or playable but bis is depending on modders not to expand the game but basically to make the game work no matter how good the mod team is its still less efficient and effective to try to fix a broken ai with an addon as opposed to fixing the core code bis is content to be lazy and coast on its unpaid modders but theres only a handful of people who work on aigame core issues a lot work on maps and missions but core realismerrors are another matter and they seem pretty tired of doing this stuff its also a pretty sht thing for bis to do to release a full priced game with barely any content crappy optimization an outdated engine and terrible ai but then expect the modders to bail them out of trouble well maybe it aint gonna happen this time hell maybe they cant pull it off this time even if they want to tldr this is alpha quality work at a final version price bis maintains that its games are like fine wine that age well when actually theyre more like cheap wine that you need to take home and mix with fruit juice and a pound of sugar to be in any way drinkable arma 3 is yet another great concept that in practice is totally undermined and destroyed by what is either laziness or incompetence from the developers wait a year from now maybe the modders will fix this lazy incompetent mess and arma 3 will be a playable game like arma 2 until then just play arma 2

so where do i start review is below please read all before passing judgement  im so so so disappointed  i bought a pc again after a massive 8 year pc break when i moved to console in very late 2006  i bought an xbox 360 which i owned for almost 6 years then only 13months ago i moved too xbox one had it for 4 months and thought get rid of this piece of junk and use the money i get and put it towards a new gaming pc so june this year 2014 i bought a pc anyway so i bought a pc with one thing in my mind yes it will be like the old days i will join back up with my clan i was with almost 7 years ago i enjoyed countless hours days weeks years with the lads on operation flashpoint  cold war arma and then arma 2 i was in the aircorps for them gol clan they are called so i signed up for them cause i forgot my password come on its been 7 years ago and used the same name as i was back in 2006 ish gol tactical i thought wow its been that long i was wiped from there system  anyway lt chris didnt know how i was so i mentioned a few names to him and that were old clan memebers and he stopped talking for a split second are its you bloody knife which was my original name before changing to gol clan when i was expected the guy that made me start an aircorps i was so excited to be back sadly most of the old memebers werent around god i sound like a child im 25 sorry for all the text above  i just wanted youpeople to know that ive played arma before for alot longer than most 7 years straight i bet most reading this didnt know about operation flashpoint was originally part of the same team that is today currently making amra still today anyway present day 30122014 the review im sorry but the arma i grew up to love is just not the same arma arma 3 is like to me the call of duty of today every childs dream its the game that they must have otherwise your not cool etc although that last statment isnt true for arma franchise it only came extemely popular in like 2007 to early 2008 thats how much i love or sould i say loved arma it was my goto game whenever i was bored i would talk about arma when i was at school when i was with anyone as soon as i got in lets play arma whenever i had spare time lets play arma i even bunkedskipped days of school to play more i just didnt get bored of arma or arma 2 or operation flashpoint cold assault if im honest it consumed all of my early teens and into my late teens yes a full 7 years of my life i was coming up to be 19 and on my birthday i bought a xboxb 360 go and read the above for a full discription  so the arma i knew was a realistic military simulator the best simulator infact but arma 3 what have you done youve gone slightly futurisitc why its a military sim how can you simulate something that isnt even made yet keep it with the real life stuff that is used today you at least in my eyes have ruined my childhood game thanks bohemia interactive and 555 games thanks a bunch it isnt all bad though its just because of my history with the game as you can tell they are many happy customers giving good reviews but if arma 1 and 2 and 25 is anything to go by hopefully they are modders out there that feel the same way as me and remove all the futuristic stuff and replace with real equipment weapons etc that are used today if you got this far thanks for reading and dont base the game of my review its just because of my history with the game the core components are there with what i can assume is realistic simulation its just not me furturisitc stuff in a simulator you cant call it a sim in my eyes anyway so as you can tell i dont recommend this game even the it almost hurts to say it

after playing this for a very long time i have come to the conclusion that the community has completely ruined this game this game is great and it has had a lot of attention put to it but the community is unbelievably stupid when it comes to gamemodes there are only four gamemodes available in multiplayer and theyre all flawed up the   gamemode 1 survival zombies and wasteland zombie modes are boring and wasteland is extremely boring  gamemode 2 king of the hill this is the closest thing youll get to proper pvp action but the leveling system is beyond awful newer players are utterly crushed by higher level players who are all wearing ghillie suits holding high powered sniper rifles and flying around in jets with unlimited missles new players are given a starter weapon which is totally useless and you dont get anything good until you reach level 13 which wouldnt be a problem if the leveling didnt take forever then you have the massive problem with team stacking because players are given a big xp reward if they win the game so they all stack on one team making it impossible for other teams to win overall king of the hills leveling and cash system is awful and the best way to beat it is to camp in the cap zone until you reach level 13 but that will take you a good ten hours  gamemode 3 roleplay its just like darkrp in garrys mod except its super laggy to the point where its unplayable and the servers are all ran by teenagers with serious issues because they setup these convoluted police recruitment systems then they have there police force act like the kgb overall atlis roleplay is a waste of time because of lag and an endless stream of trolls who do everything in there power to make the game unplayable  gamemode 4 battle royale i hope you like waiting in spectate or waiting for the server to unlock  overall community the community ruined this game with flawed and boring gamemodes if youre looking for the real arma experince you have to join a clan but clans are really strict only play at set times and dont like people who are new to the arma series game i could go on for hours about the awful bugs ui dlc and price of the dlc but instead im going to talk about serious connection problems and the system requirements connection problems even if you find a server thats in your country and you have a ping of 20 youll still lag like crazy making the already broken hitboxes even harder to hit system requirements thankfully i have a super computer and i can run this game on ultra settings but this game will go to war with your cpu and graphics card i miss arma 2 operation arrowhead because people used to play cooperative gamemodes like insurgencyi miss insurgencyit almost brings a tear to my eye edit after searching for countless hours i finally found a coop arma mission people play called annex its pretty good but this game is still not worth your money

well am an arma 2 veteran i was skeptical on getting the 3rd game of the series and man am i sad to say this game is a blow to the series while there are many new things that do look and feel rather amazing most of the content was cut out by the devs due to unknown reasonslack of weaponsvehiclesmaps and general content makes the game feel rushed and unfinished i have been there since alpha and yet not much honestly has changed i think the creators let this game slip with intention since little information is given about new content from the community managers and devs themselfs making this just another generic ocdadd combat shooter it may best to say wait 5 years until most of the content will be added by the fanbase and community modders

part of the appeal of this game is the realism ie ballistics stamina environment which positive reviewers rave about the realism makes this the most exciting and actionpacked pc game ive ever played the majority of the game is sprinting for five seconds to a badly rendered bush or maybe a tree with three sides then having to pause for 30 seconds so that your aim will calm itself how did the game know i have parkinsons youll unload three clips trying to shoot one contact 100 yards away in an open field and feel ecstatic after staring and shooting at one another for a good minute its almost like playing tag with good friends except for the part where someone gets tagged i did enjoy the sounds of bullets whizzing by and im sure the ai experienced the same bliss since we did nothing but lie on the ground and fire seemingly randomly at one another ironically when well hidden behind a tree or rock or other random cover and peek around the corner the ai suddenly becomes an expert marksman and kills you with one shot thatll teach me for trying to be tactical save points are set within the game and waypoints are even more predictable leading to nonfrustrating replays and nonexistent monotony theres no real way to be stealthy or use environmental advantages because the ai has xray and autoaim so thats a relief your squad will most likely make all the kills and leave you in the dust since stamina does not affect them the way it affects you also certain characters have infinite health so theres no real urgency in helping with firefights time to kick back and let everyone else have fun then theres the weird controls which will have you rolling on the floor literally out of cover right into incoming fire thats the last thing the enemy expects youll try to scavenge weapons and ammo from fallen soldiers only to be shot dead while trying to navigate the extremely simple and intuitive equipment interface i guess thats my fault for not being able to perform 400 actions per minute as a plus you can steal clothing and make yourself wear glasses or bandanas which have no real tactical advantage besides trolling a fallen soldier i forgot to mention that youll bleed out and die if you dont bandage your arm with a first aid kit after being shot anywhere on your body thats actually pretty realistic since its a medical fact that your arm is the hub of all your blood circulation and health as youre wounded aim and mobility decrease to the point thats so real you wont be able to contribute in any positive way except to be cannon fodder for the enemy its ok though when you die youll get to respawn with full health but then when you restart the checkpoint you cant fire your gun because theres apparently a glitch in programming or is it which doesnt allow reloading this is great since the game already saved your progress and youre stuck with one bullet you cant fire anyways the realism is scary i would not recommend this game for $60 or even on sale for $30 i would wait till the price increases to at least $9999 so that way youll maximize your regret for spending so much money on a game thats so realistic you could go outside with an airsoft gun and have the exact same experience just make sure youre terrible at everything and the illusion will be complete sorry not illusion simulation

review date 21062014 this game would be great but without its horrible body armor system or how you wanna call it in short as you see in this video at 1106 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmal2cmf_pje you take 5x56 mm rifle point it at the soldiers chest and it takes 5 hits to kill him when he is wearing bulletproof vest if wearing stronger vest it takes 11 hits yeah you read it right and there is even more when you are trying to kill ai controlled soldier situation usually looks like this you approach your enemy from back take your rifle shoot him once in second he turns to you you try to shoot him for a second time he gives you instant headshot and kills you after a while of playing you will start to feel like your weapons cant kill anyone and that you are absolutely harmless to your enemy and shooting from greater distance its just saying hi to them

operation flashpoint was good i bought it three times arma was acceptable i bought it and its addons arma 2 was excellent i bought it twice and i also received it as a gift over steam but frankly arma 3 is completely disappointing in 2035 rocket launchers are utter  and the art of guidance systems has been completely lost in 2035 ifvs are going slower than tanks and flips magically for no reasons in 2035 your occular implants shows you full screen advertisings for having been a passenger in an helicopter that no one cares about added in a dlc in 2035 weapon zeroing is made en masse over advertised values for ammo ie if your ammo is made to leave the muzzle at 800ms and actually leaves it at 920as for the katiba then you will definitely not hit your target beyond 500 meters because it will overshoot it in 2035 aa rockets are tracking the target as soon as they leave the launcher good luck if the target is going downward because your rocket will go downward too in 2035 westland lynx are equiped with rockets not guided missiles in 2035 the fennek is an mrap but on the plus side the retractable periscope is funny to use in 2035 aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications you will have 9 fps in 2035 players will be so stupid that you will want to kill them all even your teammates because they will join the strongest teams in 2035 aa radars are the most useless stuff ever created only usefull for single targets and on the ground what happened to the operation flashpoint scanner  in 2035 you will finally be able to go underwater too bad theres nothing to do there and finally in 2035 you can forget about usefull vehicles here mraps do not have at launchers and aa tanks have a ridiculously short range bad accuracy useless radar and only 4 rockets which may allow you to shoot down one helicopter hovering and not using countermeasures in short the future sucks for the record i have 976 hours of play time on arma 3 at the time i write this this number is still bound to increment but i can not recommend the game for anyone until they fix their engine and the future

they did some cool things in this game dont get me wrong 2000 hours arma 2 the massive issue that i have with this game is they have put in dlc go figure more band wagon devs but its not so much that they are charging an outrageous price for the dlc its the fact that they water mark your screen to the point that its not fun to play as if that didnt get their point across before you can quit the game your in you are forced to look at an advertisement for their dlcs that you cant skip and will be unable to leave your game until its finished very very poor model for doing business and i will never buy another game from this company the mods make this game what it actually is which are developed for free from the community

cant recommend this game youd think bohemia would of learnt from arma 2 but its still just as buggy poorly optimized and probs wont get fixed they will just release an arma 4 game is great dont get me wrong but the game is ruined by the completely poor performance

too high cpu usage in multiplayer needs cpu like 4790k

not bad but not good by any means the helicopter dlc literally is 2 helicopters and mechanics that should have just been included in the base game to begin with literally the epitome of a ing money grab stamina system is wonky having played arma 2 previous where your guy could sprint for the same time as in arma 3 without being literally out of breath could still aim and actually felt like he had gone through training but arma 3s stamina makes me feel like my guy was drafted and beforehand smoked 7 packs of cigarettes a day bullet damage leaves somewhat to be desired honestly 65 and 556 ive hit people does on center mass and in the neck with both rounds and it took atleast 2 more to even down them and ive yet to encounter a mod that fixes this honestly might just be me on this one also back on the stamina thing it literally kills aiming down sights for me at all when i do reinstall to play i just use hipfire and can honestly hit more than with sights after moving short  distances its asinine was ing around with my friend and popping shots at him and the moment i stopped aiming and just used hip fire it killed him honestly wish there was a middle ground option for recommending so ill just go with a 410 just based on gameplay honestly everything else is alright theyve made water inserts actually useful beefed up the stances but fell so short in other places for me

the game overall is really great if you like military simulations but sadly the perfomance is really really bad what this game needs to get a postive review from me  a 64bit client  better implementation of multithreading  better netcode warning if you have a rig similiar to mine youll only get about 40fps ingame no matter which settings you use inter core i54690 gtx 970 8gb ram

this review is a yes and a no but mostly no can i start off with saying that this game is unoptimized as crap its so difficult to run even on updated components and high end pcs there are not many gamemodes i wish there were more large gamemods that you could play with a lot of people but there are no point in making those gamemodes because the game is so unoptimized with tons of people if you try to go in the most played gamemode on arma 3 the rp servers its toxic as hell to cancerous now the good things  the combat is amazing i love the player vs player combat 710 better with realism mods  the mass amount of realism mods there are for missions mods are a big part and the game is bland without them  the missions on the nondefault arma 3 maps are amazing ecspecially with realism mods overall you have to have mods to have fun on the game

this game is huge it has endless possibilities it could provide lots of fun but what happens in the end is the absolutely poorly optimized engine which completely fails to deliver smooth experience i own a 980gtx  i7 and 16gig of ram and no matter what settings i set up i always get 2030 fps and in intense firefights it slows to a miserable 1015 the game was launched back in 2013 and it really hurts to see bohemia fail to deliver a smooth experience for everyone its a joke really almost two years and we still have these problems shame

this game is hands down the best shooter ever made it is a very immersive game that has features that make it feel like real life you get injured and if you heal you will walk slower carry too much and you wont be able to move realistic stamina etc the amount of weapons and vehicles is nice but nowhere near the competitors yet those few weapons have the most realistic damage and ballistics of any game ive played now after seeing that you are probably asking why i didnt suggest this game to others well the game has a lot of cool features and is very promising in all the different ways you can play but the game is unplayable at times and is very unreliable in single player a $2000 dollar computer will run at 4050 fps on all maxed out video settings that being one of the major faults of the game itself a game shouldnt require two to three thousand dollars for a computer to run single player at subpar frame rates that same single player also has one of the worst ai systems in a game if youre in the line of fire prone with your group of guys they will shoot you to get to the enemy this happens more often than you would think and its such a problem your squad mates will often kill each other the enemy ai is far superior in combat and you will find yourself leaving your ai squad behind so you can actually accomplish missions because they tend to get the attention of the enemy ai which seems to target you first no matter what the enemy ai can see you through bushes 800m away crawling through the 3ft tall grass so if you want a stealth shooter go somewhere else in fact if you want a better ai and squad experience go buy the original ghost recon because it had a better ai and squad system than this game who cares about single player john ok then so you give up on the single player and you go to multiplayer expecting a similar experience without having to worry about the ai youll start up a moderate sized 40 man server that has a ping of 30 when you join that is about full and your system will bog down to 1015 fps you go around a corner checking for enemies in a town and you wont be able to move your gun fast enough and youll get owned over and over if you try to be in a vehicle with a person who has a junk computer good luck seeing anything all in all great features on a horrible performance platform and to make up for it you need a server for a computer

its really hard for me to give this game a negative review i love arma so much and i still love this game but it has so many issues and is lacking so much content i played arma ii for years i would still play arma iii now but i would never pay full price for it again the ai can be completely braindead as in cant drive in a straight line prepare to edit your waypoints in the editor at least 4050 times before they still dont really drivewalkact properly yet this totally braindead ai can spot you crouching in a bush from 1200 metres away and hit you 68 times with his small rifle you will be getting shot at in a lot of situations where you cant even pinpoint a shots direction and if you do youll literally never be able to hit the ai like they snipe you generally even if you have a good weapon unless of course you set the skill to being nearly completely untrained that is the dlcs though were honestly a little bit of a betrayal so after that huge early aplha time you give us what two jets a few vehicles for each faction then we get dlcs that really should be inluded in the base game and honestly arent worth more than 299 each then when karts was released it waved its  in your face by allowing you to place karts assets and then try and get you to buy the dlc ingame when you try and use the assets arma ii amazing i will never get tired of the town capturing gamemodes that arent in arma iii and the huge amount of content for all factions if arma ii was updated with some of the new stancessmaller features of arma iii it would be an absolute masterpiece i just cant reccomend paying this price for this game its not worth it the dlcs shouldnt even be excluded

oh so you are soldier ready for some action  avid sniper ready to take souls of your enemies from kilometer away  helicopter pilot inbound to support your troops  nope you have to buy dlc for that an overpriced one bloody bohemia you own best milsim franchise out there one of the most popular survival games and you are telling me i need to support you with these dlcs which are just basic content ripped of game dont take the path of ubisoft or ea you can do better i think 45 is more than enough for full content of game game 1010 dlcs ripoff 010 get your margeting together

i could not recommend this game even if i wanted to download is horrible way too many gigs of space used for a game that is pretty choppy decent graphics and just a mess over all the tutorial is fair enough and the prologue is fine but the campaign is horribly tedious and thats if you dont keep dying at it and having to respawn from autosave because they dont allow you to save for yourself after a certain point be prepared to die so many times your fingers will feel it im glad to not be buying this and uninstalling it after i finish typing
