the elder scrolls v  skyrim is with no doubt one of the best games recently released an openworld rpg with an infinite amount of quests and modding support  count me in the replayability is also almost endless because you can make a totally new character with other skills and so have a new experience installing mods can also help you fighting the boredom when youve reached 300 hours ingame

for the record i have to say rip to my 360 it died one fateful night while playing this game i had around 700 hours on it at that point with skyrim  lost but never forgotten oh skyrim how i have loved you part of me thinks of you fondly when i am outside and wonder if a dragur will appear from behind a random tree or a hole in the earth that the city excavates to fix the sewage system is it time for the dragonborn never has a game had this much impact on my outward life like skyrim has it joins the ranks of grand theft auto in my possibly going insane i need to stop playing phases but it isnt your fault skyrim you are just what the doctor ordered for me from the smooth visuals to the peaceful mountain tops or soaring on a dragon that minutes ago tried to eat me and killed my thousand dollar throw away horse if you need help deciding on this game then i have to say that there is no amount of words placed together that could convey what skyrim is sure the main story is linear it does not feel as epic as past elder scrolls games but the sheer amount of fun and imagination that you can have in this game is leaps and bounds past any sandbox game i have ever played but if you must hear my words and need reassurance then i will try my best for skyrim deserves a two part review vanilla i hate vanilla not skyrim vanilla but the flavor vanilla yeah that is off topic but i always assumed that people call base unmodded games vanilla because they share the hatred of the flavor with me unmodded skyrim is beautiful and has depth and a heart that is unmatched you can do anything be anyone but at the end of the day you either go home to your wife and children or battle legions of dragur in some cave for hours where is daddy that deadbeat is picking pockets and forging daggers so he can pay for that glass case he wants to put in the armory to show off his junk or maybe daddy has a secretmaybe daddy is a vampire who lives off the blood of others in the darkness of the vale or as youtube has shown medaddy likes elaborate hidden basements where he stores the bodies of his dead o_o skyrim vanilla has it all and more it is a work of art that deserves your time modded now in a more serious tone i must say that this is now a different game you can be anyone do anything create anything and never run out of custom quests you can upgrade the visuals to a stunning degree and bask in the hd glory if you want skyrim you need to mod you have to mod it will call to you and you will answer and the sickness will set in and you will never be the same but you will love it and you will never turn back i can not go into further detail because i just cant there are too many mods to even begin a proper review of modded skyrim maybe you want to weild a  sword while dressed as finn from adventuretime while pikachu follows behind you the possibilities are endless and i implore you to mod your skyrim just do it and you will never look back just buy it already and join the millions who already have found one of the greatest games of all time

intro skyrim is a excellent rpg if your looking for quantity over quality the game does not shine with impacting story as much as other more focused rpgs because of the freedom it offers that doesnt stop it from being a great experience to most and memorable at that the main quest takes a couple of hours but there is 300 hours of side content to go through beside it which is the greatest amount of content any game i have seen has to offer the mods only add more content on top of that and give it insane amount of longevity advantages and disadvantages  300 hours of content  perk system that is well thought out  mod philosophy that allows people to add more value to the game as a community  replayability is extremely high due to mods and classes  environments are done well for most part with minor blemishes  many interactions with npcs thanks to companion mods  npcs are not very animatedexpressful as other smaller more focused rpgs  due to the freedom of the game the experience is not as consistently exciting  default ui is bad mod ui cures this  level scaling should be bound to equipment for more consistent scaling community the skyrim community has put alot of dedication and work into adding tons of value to this game the steam workshop is also a nice simple addition to make mod installation easy and quick for people this said i would like to see more quality in game combat although the perk system makes up for this mods enchance mods can provide you with a fresh experience and expand the longevity of the game it improves the quality of the game with better graphics environments lore quests companions and other community crafted content warning mods can conflict try to figure out whats conflicting some require dlc

skyrim is without a doubt one of the most epic games ever made whether youre a fan of roleplaying games or not this title will appeal to you regardless yesits that good unless you have the time to play twelve hours a day seven days a week then the basic game will keep you occupied for many many months on end add to that the content from the ever growing mod community and this is a game that you could potentially play forever ultra recommended
recommended
epic game  every one knows this you would have to live on mars not to know this  but like many other reviews on steam the company practice is also a part of the game experiance and people are quite happy to down vote games because of there buisness practice and this is no different  bethesda and valve made a shameless attempt to make a cash grab on mods  they failed only because people stood up to them other wise we would be paying for mods now in most games what makes it worse is both companys own a large part of there rise and success down to free mods suggesting a donation box for the actual developers of the mods who put time into making it and not a requirement to get the mod just a donation option people telling me to change the review are the same people who where trying to tell us all why paid mods is a good thing white knights of valve and skyrim please insert your tears and buthurt in the comments section below i only charge $1 per comment

the province of skyrim might be frigid but the roleplaying game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess yes skyrim is another enormous fantasy rpg from a developer that specializes in them and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within the game returns you to the continent of tamriel where you explore the northern realm called skyrim home to the nord race in these northern regions snow flurries cloud your view and platforms of ice float on the chilled waters nighttime often brings tamriels version of the aurora borealis with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons stretching across the heavens skyrims predecessor oblivion featured prototypical fantasy environmentspretty but not quite evocative of the lores darker undercurrents skyrim embraces its darker elements you might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a halfsunken ship through the mist or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament closer inspection reveals hard edges plain paintedon textures and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should you seek them out but like many enormous games skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed but because they contribute to a grander whole theres so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures offering dozens of choices at any given time each one as enticing as the nextits impressive enough that theres so much to do its even more impressive that most of it is wonderful not every dungeon is a joy to explore stoneturning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits but overall every task has an excellent sense of context and surprises lurk around many a turn skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you you may not be a big fan of reading books in roleplaying games but even so you should make an effort herethe combat in skyrim is the tightest elder scrolls combat yet the visual and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zapssome death blows result in fallout 3style slowmotion kills which retain their power because theyre not overly frequent movement too has seen improvement you can now play from a thirdperson view and feel like youre moving across the land instead of floating above it all in all skyrim has some minor issues but as a whole is a brilliant rpg

for those who dreamed of a game that allowed to cross the woods discover secrets and explore a world full of dangers and full of opportunities the release of the elders scrolls v skyrim is a dream come true bethesda improves what has been done with oblivion putting a cure realization and amount of content that we never expected after about forty hours of play apart from the main quest we did not come at the head of almost anything many are content things to do and those that perhaps we will never make there is some venial sins and approach the statistics to which we must get used to but the fact remains that skyrim is a masterpiece the kind that has a duty to live if you love rpgs and those video games that only some software companies are still able to do

despite what you may have heard this game is not actually about dragons all that much the story centers around vietnam vet john wayne a devoted husband and loving father troubled by his past when jarl snowden summons john to his court in bethlehem the player is given the first key game mechanic the look at stuff feature this feature is innovative and fresh giving the player a new way to interact with the game using the mouse the player can move johns head and experience what stuff looks like through his eyes or if youre a pro like me youll want to toggle to third person so you can see johns back aswell this new feature has never been seen before in any game and renders the genre fresh again after jarl snowden talks to john about some nsa leak scandal you must take on the role of johns alter ego rage cage and spend the next day and half walking to hyrule once there king hugh jayniss informs you that you could of just fast travelled here instead of walking upon which i put down the game to write this review

note to see this review in its true form go tohttpwildwoodgeek2blogspotcom201404gameskyrimhtml ah skyrim the king of rpg games and the game that led to a flood of crappy arrow to the knee jokes that swarmed the internet for months i doubt there is anyone who doesnt know of skyrim by now but ill give you my twocents skyrim is a actionrpg that plays out in a masvie openworld with thousands of side queststhings to plantgather and to fight skyrim is in a bloody civil war between the storm cloaks and the imperial army but under the surface even more factions are fighting for turf the thieves guild its glory long gone strives to reclaim their title as masters of darkness the dark brotherhood crumbling and in despair seeks out new opportunities to return to the day when people feared them and respected them the college of winterhold a old school for mages that fell into hard times after half of winterhold fell into the ocean uncovers a powerful relic that could allow infinite wisdom or infinite destruction that is just a sample of the deep story and background of skyrim the world of skyrim is alive and many a writer spent long hours making a amazing and lifelike world the best part about skyrim is there is so much to do want to be a vampire you can do that want to be a werewolf and murder people you can do that want to kill people and eat them for dinner guess what you can do that < you know that is a slight bit creepy but really skyrim is an openworld dream the main storyline is fun and engaging the side quest sometimes turn into their own winding paths that take hours to complete this makes skyrim a huge source of fun and gameplay there are a few problems with skyrim however the game crashes often on some pcs but some mods on the nexus mod site will help with that and of course with some a huge world there are also bugs aglore and with bethseda gone off to the elder scrolls online chances are that they wont get fixed but the mod community has dealt with these bugs and most can be fixed by downloading the unofficial patch the steam workshop and nexus mods provide an endless source of gamechanging content from new armor to flying houses to brand new branching quests and that there is the best part of skyrim on pc the mods available explode your gamecontent you play as a king of skyrim you can marry and kill multiple wifes you can get thousands of new weapons even lightsabers gamers with epic gaming pcs can download the free ultra hd texture pack from bethsdea themselves and if you want to take it a step forward you can download ultra enbs skyrim really is a different game with mods  some players may feel that the game is too easy theres a mod for that some players may feel that the cities are too empty theres a mod for that some players may feel like there should be more npcs theres a mod for that my point is that with the mods available on pc you really can custom your skyrim experience to what you wantso even if you already own skyrim on ps3 or xbox 360 you should still pickup the elder scrolls v skyrim on the steam store

i have been playing games almost my whole life 15 years i can honestly say this is one of the best games i have ever played and i will tell you why i have had around 500 hours invested into this game across multiple platforms and playthroughs pc is the best version first is the graphics ive added mods but just the standard game is one of the best ive ever seen the trees grass animals and the level of detail that the game includes is amazing i literally spent about 4 hours the first day of its release back in 2011 just wandering through the world examining the different things in amazement at how detailed and beautiful it was the second thing that makes this great is the commentary its all voiced and basically everyone can be spoken to in the game and everyone plays a part more on that later next is the content 100 dungeons around 10 major cities and a few extra small towns there is much to see and explore i can honestly say through about 500 hours of gameplay i still can find new places or things ive somehow missed over the hours quests and random events are all throughout these places you will not run out of things to do and if by some chance you do there are mods haha now that being said most everyone in the game is killable and if you kill them it may stop a certain small side quest from being available so you really have to make decisions wisely choices matter and if you dont watch yourself you can miss out which can hook you into another playthrough like i was you can play mostly as a mage as a sworded warrior an archer or create something of your own its all up to you now before im done i will add that the 3 dlc packs dawnguard hearthfire and dragonborn are all great additions if you have the money buy the lengendary edition of the game its worth it dawnguard adds some extra gameplay and features hearthfire add the ability to build your own home and adopt children actually really cool additions then dragonborn adds a whole new questline and location to play on they are all worth the money and you will not go wrong buying this game only minor things not even worth mentioning are problems in this game and i would not hesitate to give it a 99100 easy but as one final warning it is possible to lose yourself in this game ive spent roughly 500 hours playing this one game and still far from laying it down it can take your life and give you a virtual one think with hearthfire home wife kids a whole life its an amazing game and i highly recommend you buy it

let me take you back to mid2011 when i first heard of skyrim coming out later that year i wasnt thrilled at all having played oblivion briefly in the past and not being convinced at all skyrim became the most overhyped game i could think of when it eventually went on the shelves and i had a few glances at the lets plays that popped up all over youtube i looked at it in sheer disbelief it looked awful very awkwardly wet textures that was one of my main issues honestly i decided however and that was after the initial euphoria with the gaming community had died down a bit during the frosty nights of early january of 2012 i might give it a go once a legit price drop had occurred and the big hype had completely dispersed so then in april of 2012 i finally ordered a retail copy from the uk i had ordered it together with a dear friend of mine that regularly orders games from the uk on account that they are much cheaper there than in germany and he encouraged me to boot it up i had a good time with it but it was well just good i had tried a few mods from the steam workshop for my first time playing mainly the hd texture pack and a few other minor tweaks i continued to play the game and eventually i became aware of the much larger modding community of the nexus pages and this is where my interest in the game finally sparked immensely modding became more of a challenge and i needed help this help came in the form of gophers modding guides gopher offered a variety of concise and easy to follow guides to modding games on his youtube channel as well as and that was the gist of it all a very entertaining series of lets plays of skyrim his play style is somewhat different to what i had had in the past but it so verily applied to how i feel about games in general games are the perfect medium of literary immersion a game can engage you on so many more levels than a book or a film can ever dare to and that is exactly why skyrim eventually became such a dear game to me skyrim is a game that rewards engagement in its lore it can become so lively so intricately designed but only if the player is willing to go further than bluntly playing the game it is a living breathing world with a back story so rich that one can not ever learn all of it i myself regularly lose myself reading through the articles on the elder scrolls wiki pages stepping from one topic into the next the story of skyrim is very iconic in the way that it is written joseph campbells monomyth or the heros journey in which the protagonist is called from his normal life to adventure on a quest to save the world there are obstacles along the way wise teachers and climactic action the monomyth is a pattern that works well and it does so in skyrim too the internal development of the dragonborn hero however is up to the imagination of the player and this is where immersion comes into play again if you are not willing to immerse yourself in the game and identify with the dragonborn the game will have no lasting value to you the gameplay also intrigued me having slight prior experience with rpgs i have touched the basics of typical rpg game play skyrim however stands out from the crowd by making levelling an organic process you swing a sword at an enemy  you get better at sword fighting you get hit  your experience with armour increases you mix ingredients together  you learn their effects and become better at creating potions this process this learningbydoing feels very natural very logical much more so than the typical rpg practice of gaining experience through completing quests or fights and then choosing yourself what you want to become better at another great implication of this levelling model is that it essentially resolves the issue of classrestrictions you can be whoever you want to be you can be a heavily armoured mage you can be a lightly armoured twohanded weapon wielding killing machine you can combine magic and onehanded weaponry and most importantly you are allowed to do all of them at once if you choose to the combat itself runs in real time like its predecessors and there is no automatic hitandmiss calculation involved like it was the case in morrowind for example ergo you hit  you hit you miss  you miss an actionstyle combat system however and this is a big however there is no locational hit detection so that head shots or blows to specific body parts on enemies generally have no different effect from hitting any other body part this is made up by the fact that certain perks add chances of critical damage to their respective weapon types the world design of skyrim at times is stunningly beautiful aweinspiring vistas gloomy caves and warm inviting inns and then there are times when everything looks a bit dull this is owed to the fact that skyrim is such a resource heavy game that in the development bethesda had to work with a lot of ambient lighting which is not always practical and doesnt look very good vanilla modders jargon for the unmodded game skyrim therefore suffers a few drawbacks in regards to its looks and so we come to my final argument this argument may be the strongest of all because it might eliminate all of the issues that i have with the game it is the moddabilty through the use of mods that can also be created by the player itself using the free creation kit that came with the copies of the game every mistake every bug every minute inadequacy can be remedied if you dont like the look of something you can mod it if you dont like the way something works you can mod it if you feel something is missing from the game or something it is need of you can mod it in if something is broken you can fix it with mods modding can add to the game in such a grand way it can change your experience entirely or it can just enhance it and it can make skyrim play the way you want this is what the elder scrolls v skyrim is all about player choice if you will you can play it for a couple of hours and then never touch it again but if you are willing to engage yourself further there is so much more you can do with it it can become your very own epic poem

i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun one of skyrims major cities when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot an orcish mace in the other they were on display for nobody but me and my computercontrolled housecarl lydia who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls dragons a civil war and job assignments that never seem to go as planned its even a sensible thing to do a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim one of the most fullyrealized easily enjoyable and utterly engrossing roleplaying games ever made part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated in skyrim theres no more moonhopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill thats gone so is athletics the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major you dont assign major and minor skills at all but instead pick one of ten races each with a specific bonus high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective closerange combat these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic sneaking and weapon combat emphasizing firsthand experience over instruction manual study letting you specialize only when youre ready it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim do a quest kill a dragon snatch torchbugs from the air munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within little feels random and useless even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities making every step you take even if its through what seems like total wilderness an exciting one as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame momentarily all on the battlefield unite directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature creating impromptu moments of camaraderie  a surprising change from what may have been yet another bythenumbers bandit camp sweep dragons show up often their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles stops to attack circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv can be completed in a few minutes and always offer a useful reward killing a dragon yields a soul which powers skyrims new shout system these are magical abilities any character can use you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time throw your voice change the weather call in allies blast out ice and fire or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force even if you favor sword shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story joined with the thieves guild fought alongside the dark brotherhood or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim not only is this land under assault by dragons long thought to be dead its also ripped in two by civil war you can choose one side or the other but so much of the allure of skyrim is how even outside of the confines of quest lines the embattled state of the world is evident and steeped in a rich fictional legacy lord of the rings this is not but with the release of every elder scrolls game the fiction becomes denser and the crossreferencing for longtime fans all the more rewarding skyrims residents are all aware of current events theyll comment on the civil war some sympathizing with the rebels others thinking the establishment sold its soul the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor many characters feel like whole distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans characters stereotype based on race they doublecross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable and they react to your evolving stature within the world it makes a ridiculous realm filled with computercontrolled cat people and humanoid reptiles demon gods and dragons feel authentic like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave the game has one of the largest active modding communities of any game this helps to spice up gameplay and graphics with new residents new weapons and armor incredible house mods adding giant castles and visual mods you can spend hours upon hours finding mods that suit your needs in the nordic lands of skyrim it is worth to note that you should know the game to an extent before modding as it can corrupt save files if not done properly if id have to rate it it would be a 1010

greatest game ive ever played skyrim changed my perspective on gaming as a whole its a work of art from the second you create your character you wont ever be bored again while playing theres always something to do in skyrim always new quests new locations or dragons to slay and the graphics are amazing everything is great and even though i feel that the npcs couldve been programmed a little bit better its nothing that doesnt make the game experience amazing best 60$ ive ever spent and i would gladly have paid more buy it 3

skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time this game is pure art the role play is great if you are a nerd like me however if you dont plan on role playing and you just want to play an amazing game then you can unlike other titles like fallout this game does not punish you and it is not a very hard game i played it in master for most of my stay in the land of skyrim this game is the kind of type game where it is not about the end its all about the journey i have played a lot of rpgs in my day and in most the quests have been bland and the main idea was to explore however this game can be both the quests are great the story is great the map is amazing yeah there may not be as many random encounters like fallout however when exploring you will allways find something new and as we are pc master race we also get the privlage of mods that add alot more to the game which is amazing i mainly enjoyed some of the modded quests and horror quests if you dont have this game by now fcking buy it jez 1010

the elder scrolls v skyrim review by delicioushotschmoes release date november 11 2011 genre action roleplaying developers bathesda game studios platforms pc ps3 xbox 360 the review it probably already goes without saying that if you dont own or even heard of skyrim which you will give me a heart attack if you havent youre really missing out on a fantastic game borrowing many elements from this games own prequels everything from the leveling up system to the wide arsenal of magic to be learned or discovered the untamed fearful dragons and monsters that lurk around every corner of the games world the carefree and quirky races that inhabit the beautiful lands villages and meadows and the many different hobbies with skills involved such as cooking weapon smithing magic crafting item synthesizing and studios book reading this game is what i call fantasy ectasy and is a king amongst most action roleplaying games each unique race has a special ability that again is unique only to them and solely based on the players personal preference such as the argonian race being immune to poison and the gills with skills to breathe underwater or maybe the wood elf being the deadeye master of the bow and arrow as you can tell there are many races and strategies that would help out either sooner or later in the game depending on the race of character you have chosen whats best about this is the vast ways you can customize the physical appearances of these races ranging from nose types eye types ear types hair types body types etc even im guilty to say ive spent countless hours trying and failing to create a nord reminiscent of my appearance and if you ever need a helping hand with extras look no forward to the mod community they of course definitely help out not only with your characters physical appearance but also along with everything else the world of skyrim is diverse solid beautiful secluded peaceful amazing creative magical and the list goes on you could explore for hours upon end of this games landscape and not be surprised on how much detail and development has been put into it from the untouched wilderness to the ancient mythical buildings that dot skyrims land its definitely no surprise on how this game keeps you occupied and truly captures the imagination of magic and mystery in the process its as if a lucid dream came to the unconscious mind of a sleeping video game geek who is subsequently pitching a tent theres the main story with the longwhinded yet slightly repetitive missions where you play as your main character and eventually learn that you are the legendary dragonborn and depart for one hell of an adventure to save the beautiful land of skyrim while causing a ruckus for bandits wizards giant spiders the undead the royal knights and all around powerful dragons at the same time but what this game truly dishes is out is simply a marvel to behold and when i say this i mean that this game is offering an immense load in the sidequest and minigame section along with the many uncharted locations and hidden caves that are just waiting for your epic heroheroine to discover with rewards and many different possibilities and alternate outcomes to unlock in this wonderful game if you go out and mind your own business by robbing the local residents just make sure to blatantly put a vase on top of their heads so they dont suspect you of theft and go into a killing frenzy just a tip for you all if youre into huge epic tales set in a fantasy and mythical environment or just blatantly love a great storyline and narrative with a huge variety of memorable characters creatures dungeons and dragons this massive game of amazing preportions is definitely for you

on the surface skyrim is an open world first person role playing game or third person with the press of a button a fps rpg so to speak skyrim and the elder scrolls as a series are games that let you do what you want play how you want if you want to be a big axed barbarian a thief an archer a mage a healer or any mixture of them you can do it if you just want to mess around and shout goats off of cliffs go for it youll be able to select a race each with its own look and perks you can even be a lizard argonian or a cat khajit whatever floats your boat youll even be able to turn into a vampire and werewolf the npcs are a lot more diverse with facial hair body sizes and so on its a good step forward to bring elder scrolls to what other games have had for a decade the game offers nice diverse gameplay for any style you can stealth around avoid combat completely or just run in swords blazing the game has excellent killing animations that are new to skyrim you can sink hours days months into this game and even if you were to run out of things to do mods would still provide a lot more content so whats the story dragons are back and only you can save skyrim after one of them levels a town the story is unimportant its basically the same story from oblivion portals pop up and destroy a town you are dovakin and gain the ability to shout what is shouting its like magic with a button of its own its really nice having a quick magic button much better than the former way of having to call upon a spell now in skyrim the game you can equip each hand with weapons shields or spells so dual weilding magic or weapons if you want or a big weapon in both hands it makes for something fresh and new healing in one hand fire spelling in the other all while shouting to stun your enemies the combat feels a lot better and less generic than before the spells are a lot more fun to use with good visual effects the dragons are notably awesome they fly around burning down villages mercilessly killing everything and theyll follow you youll see them burn down towns not because its scripted but because thats what the ai is programmed to do youll see villagers pull out daggers clear out of houses all to fight these dragons once a npc is dead theyre dead so if it was your favorite shopkeeper theyre gone sure there are spells to make them return as a zombie and fight for you but the game is forever or at least until you console hack youll be able to fail quests if npcs die and you dont get that quest back the ai and its interaction has always been interesting in the elder scrolls series youll see guards defend towns against attacks youll see bandits attacking people now in skyrim youll see wolves hunting lesser animals like goats chickens and foxes it makes the game feel alive and you can use that ai to your advantage since nothing is scripted its all your experience you can talk about how you were saved by a ranger on a horse or how you baited a strong bear to a group of hunters that killed it the game has an abundance of dungeons and each one feels like a healthy chunk of gameplay especially for explorers the elder scrolls series has come a long way since morrowind the prefab dungeons that all look alike are gone every location looks beautiful dungeons exteriors vistas and they somehow even made the sewers diverse gorgeous and rich with color style and interest there are plenty of monsters and seeing giant spiders is just nightmarish even playing all of the horror games i do no other game has made me as squeamish enemies have random levels random loot weapons and armor so youre never really fighting the same enemy twice the cave entrances are a lot more realistic and actual caves rather than doors while thats not exactly important the game is really all about the look that seems to be the big takeaway that i get from this game for those that dont like deep dungeon delving other than the first dungeon you dont ever have to enter another dungeon you can hang out in cities exploring the wilderness hunting thieving from people murdering everyone running from guards mixing potions from ingredients doing quests making spells and a beautiful new system to make armors and improve weapons it feels much better and realistic than the old method of using hammers generically now you need to find a blacksmith use his forge and grindstone enchanting and alchemy are similar processes you cant just do them on the go you need to find an alchemist and enchanting table it makes sense and it doesnt seem like a step back from what it was it just feels more realistic youll also be able to mine for ore and chop wood for gold the game has a healthy length more than most games and thats even when you use the games fast travel system exploring is a lot of the fun though and you cant just fast travel to a new location you need to find it and there is something around every corner on your way to ancient ruins you can climb a mountain find a bandit hideout and do everything but actually reach those ancient ruins skyrim is a cold wintery place inhabited by mostly nords it is very reminiscent of viking culture and thats a good thing it makes the game feel far different than oblivion and morrowind new to the series is a breakaway from typical direct face to face dialog instead youll be able to talk to people as the world around you still lives there is a new minimalistic menu instead of a giant text box at the bottom of the screen it is all designed to look like a photograph and not break immersion everything is fully voiced and masterfully voiced but the only catch is there are only a few voice actors for thousands of lines of dialog speaking with someone is a typical dialog tree and this game more than the previous games make me feel like this game matters with the things you say to people when given a choice like all open world games and previous games in the series there are bugs and flaws npcs have a daily cycle and youll see them disappear in front of doors as they enter the animation is pretty awful and stiff fro the npcs watching them run turn then run some more is painful to watch you can easily knock clutter around but not nearly as easily as dead space none of this is a game breaker these are small prices to pay for a game so good and it never really breaks the immersion as much as i make it sound since the game has been out so long its been on steam sale several times along with the legendary edition that comes with all of the official dlc the game also makes full use of steams workshop to easily add mods and keep them updated this is an amazing game if not the best of its console generation

paying for mods nuff said i know that this review is out of date i know that the problem was resolved but i still plan to leave this review here reason behind that is that i want to keep this review as a memento for any future attempt to destroy what we love about pc gaming it may sound clich but only because we wrote these reviews only because we rated these reviews and only because we spammed forums and workshop we were able to make them to remove that monstorsity i want to thank you all of you who either wrote these negative reviews or did anything at all to stop this cmon guys this review was so generic and boring and it still got more than 400 thumbs up in a few days thank you

could valve sink any lower i dont think so they already take a % for themselves from pretty much everything on steam but it doesnt seem to be enought for them it never is charging for mods is something i would never think of never it is obviously always about money how else to explain the fact that modders get only 25% from the mod price paying for mods is not an option but donating should be considered instead i do not recommend

if you are buying this game with the intention of modding it please dont with the new system of where modders get paid for their works it will lead to terrible mods being created for some quick cash not only that but valve takes 75% of the earnings and only gives the creators 25% they are taking advantage of the skyrim modding community you probably have seen the thousands of early access games here on steam now we have early access mods please do not support this practice modding is a hobby not a job and for any mod creators reading this no one is going to buy your  especially if you charge 10$ for a set of armor this system will only cause you to lose reputation and put you as greedy causing you to lose thousands of people who would otherwise donate to you if they like your works please do not purchase mods
not recommended
i dont support a game where mods are paid content without the usual guarantees paid content provides not only that 75% of the money goes to valve and bethesda with a paltry 25% going to the modder if his mod makes more than a total of $400 valve is basically making free money with the work of gullible people that thought they could make a quick cash grab oh and valve is also removing links to donation sites on free mods
not recommended
after valve and behesda introduced payware mods which opened a can of worms i can no longer recommend this game paywalling mods is not the way to go as it introduces too many complex issues into the modding community that brings no benefits to anyone other than the valve and bethesdas pocket filled with money i support the idea of getting the modders paid for their hard work in enriching the games but putting a paywall is not the right way i support donations for modders as it is fairer as everyone has different level of perceived value for something the only scenario i support paid mods is when a mod had done exceptional work where it can be essentially a full game or an official expansion with fair amount of new content and reasonable price tag such as age of empires 2s forgotten empires mod that became an offical expansion i would gladly pay for exceptional mods such as c&c generals rise of the reds dawn of wars ultimate apocalypse or homeworld 2s complex mod as these teams had outdone what the developers had done with the original game and also provided a fresh and vastly expanded experience to the game a sword or a handful of quests in skyrim does not provide the fresh experience like those mods mentioned above not to mention the absurd price that they are selling mods for which costs as much as the game itself valve and bethesda you ducked it all up valve really needs to get their crap together with progressively worse server connection greenlight flooding the market with garbage steam store that acts like an annoying sales man shoving garbage at you everyday client stability that is getting worse and non existent customer server at the same time valve is becoming increasingly more and more greedy to the point they even outdo ea ubisoft 2k and the lot of greedy publisher you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain harvey dent the dark knight

edit so the paid mods crisis is over but i wont change my review i highly enjoy the game but in retrospect it has no life in it skyrim is an ocean with the depth of a puddle while the game is fantastic and will give you a lot of fun you will need mods to enhanced the experience and thats why you should not buy it here you should never pay for mods never ever paidmods microtransactions

think about the message youre sending as a leader in digital rights managament and gaming platform before you decide to set a precedent as damaging as allowing users to sell their broken content through your service unfortunatley bethesda was not only all for this but wanted to then tax the creators 75% of their profit to add to the pile of cash theyve accrued from their bestselling industryleading formerly overwhelming positive reviewed game tldr cmon man if i wanted to buy broken content at a premium id just use origin

great game great community ruined by valves choice to facilitate paying for mods

valve introducing paid mods is a disaster and a paywall to a game that has already been produced and profited off of while some may say specific elements are not fully representative of the finished product the actions taken by all members through monetization and greed create a framework for failure

ive put more time into skyrim than probably any other game and for one reason mods free ing mods ive followed and supported the mod creators whose work became essential to my skyrim experience and to now see the lifeblood of this game locked up behind a paywall is disgusting mod creators should be rewarded but not with a 25% payout on a purchase made by people who havent even gotten the chance to use the mods yet lets hope everyone comes to their senses by the time tes 6 comes out then again i thought bethesda had done so after horse armor

paid mods ruining the pc gaming community aside from the issue of there being no verification that the uploader actually owns the mod are modders allowed to charge for a derivative or addon work if so do we want them to if so do we want steam to be the portal for that rather than a dedicated website which wouldnt take a cut of the profits no its skyrim you should already know the game by now mostly good and vastly improvable through free mods visuals mostly good and improvable through free mods gameplay and the wellknown radiant ai system that allows certain quest arks and mission types to be infinite this will get repetitive but is a nice way to ensure the game doesnt get boring
not recommended
paid mods are gone yes i know but my headline still stands sadly this game has now become a horse armour collecting game with the new paid dlcs i mean mods base game 310 the base game is fundimentaly boring and buggy you first need to install the unoffical patches for the game to make it stable before being able to play without quest lines breaking and ctds happeing this is because bethesda havent lifteda finger to patch the game since 2013 they dont care they let modders fix there  while they raked in the sales if you get the chance to buy this game in a sale do so its worth it but only if you use mods to make it tabel and more fun base game modded 1110

i disagree with putting mods behind a paywall due to concerns on mods breaking down and the split of profits between distributor and modder

[this is an extremely long analysis of skyrim several years after its been released feel free to skip to the bottom if you cant  dont want to read it all long story short mods make this game worth playing paid mods make it difficult to recommend] so ive been a fan of the elder scrolls since i was very little starting with oblivion moving on to skyrim and ironically falling in love with morrowind and playing the modded version more than any other nonmmo ive ever played i love the incredibly rich metaphysical surreal backstory as well as the roleplaying  simulator aspects in morrowind i just uninstalled skyrim today after realizing it just wasnt worth it anymore to keep trying to make it work its a buggy mess and when i try to pad the game with mods that make it less shallow and more fun i just have to deal with all the bugs and issues involved with the mods as well its just not worth it anymore for me the novelty of skyrim wore off very quickly as many people say its an ocean wide and a puddle deep it leads you to believe theres more to it than there is unlike previous games every character i made felt pretty much the same an oafish clumsy nord this was in part due to design decisions and also due to developer overlooks the removal of athletics and acrobatics removed an entire playstyle that allowed your character to be agile jumpy and nimble which killed bosmer  khajiit for me the fact that i couldnt do a sprinting jump and instead have to sprint wait a full second and bump into the object im trying to avoid then jump left me feeling like a clumsy stupid nord every playthrough the fact that staves dissapear when you sheathe them everyone is the same height in first person and your offhand weapon just randomly appears in your hand makes the game seem lazy and breaks my immersion unlike in morrowind guilds are less about simulating a role  job for your character and more about following a preset storyline that would be fine if the storylines were actually good my god the narrative mess that is the college of winterhold still haunts me to this day and dont get me started on the bards college the thing that really irks me about these questlines is that they all just devolve into random dungeon crawls i counted you only need to use magic thrice in the mages guild advancing through the guild has nothing to do with actually using magic or being skilled youre just watching a poorly developed story unfold not rising through the ranks of an esteemed guild of scholars theres no way to distinguish your character or give him a personality through dialogue or your race  class this was a stark difference from fallout 3 and new vegas where your perks gave you extra dialogue options and could change entire questlines and you could choose dialogue options that really gave your character an interesting personality skyrim game seems afraid to give you any consequences argonians arent allowed in windhelm except for you khajiit arent typically trusted in the cities funny no one even seems to realize im a khajiit in the first place not even a unique quest for argonian players to gain entrance into the city you may say this wouldve been too hard for the devs to implement but it makes me wonder why they present these plotpoints into the game if theyre not willing to actually follow through with them theres not even a single mention of your race throughout the entire game other than the occassional quip from a bandit my altmer was walking by some dominion soldiers and i was surprised they didnt even have any unique dialogue they just treated me like i was a nord and shooed me off not even scolding me for being a traitor to my kind entire quests could have been more unique by acknowledging the unique aspects of my player instead of pretending they dont exist the quests give you the illusion that youll be able to influence the world or change things then snatch away the opportunity at the last minute the civil war for example no matter who you side with no high king will ever be crowned and no one in the world will ever acknowledge the war is over in the markarth quest you can side with the forsworn but there are no consequences the forsworn will still be hostile to you and nothing ever comes of your allegiance you can come up with any excuse you want to explain these things but the fact remains that bethesda chose not to take these choices further so what youre left with is a shallow dungeon crawler with a lackluster combat system removal of many rp aspects a weak narrative andwell thats it i know the other games had issues too but i expect a developers work to improve over time not to mention the massive amount of gamebreaking bugs that exist am i the only one that thinks its ridiculous that modders ar ethe ones that have to make unofficial patches to fix the bugs in this game isnt that embarrassing if this was any other game company that would be unacceptable how much longer can bethesda get away with these oversights and bugs until fans get sick of it i know we like to explain it away by saying they made an ambitious open world game its hard to get rid of the bugs well if youre going to be ambitious dont you think your work and polish should reflect that ambition is worthless without execution i guess the main thing that i personally didnt like about skyrim was that it never felt like a roleplaying game or at least not the type of rpg i like morrowind felt like a roleplaying simulator where you were dorpped off in a world and left to your own devices free to simulate any role you wanted to in the mages guild you actually did research and find magic artifacts and learned about history in the imperial legion you actually felt like a gallant knight who used his brawn and his wit to keep the people of vvardenfell under control morrowind had a lot of issues and is incredibly outdated but for what it was i think that it did a better job of this than skyrim in skyrim i just feel like im on softrails in an open world watching the pretty killcams and interacting with the world but i never felt like a living person in a living world tldr the only saving grace for skyrim are the mods but they often become too much of a hassle to make it worth it with steams new introduction of paid mods skyrim has officially crossed the line into not worth it territory unless you want to pay for a full game and the dozens of mods you need to make it a great game then just go back to oblivion or morrowind or hell download morroblivion the mod that combines oblivion amd morrowind into one game its great

as a lifelong gamer i feel its my solemn duty to my hobby to have a brain aneurysm and flip the  out about a minor inconvenience like having to download mods for an old game i dont really play any more on a third party site like nexus and install them manually to avoid farting out a couple of nickels for the greedy jews at valve in order to be able to just press a button on steam that installs and updates everything automatically for me this is literally on par with the holocaust and because i consider myself someone who cares very deeply about ethics in gaming when i take a stand and scream through my keyboard understand that this is not just about being against paying money for mods  this is about the holocaust you dont support the holocaust do you so without further ado eye twitch what the  valve how dare you i hate you so much why gabe whyyyyyyyy ashdjahdkjhakjsdhasnjdkjaeiuweiljalsdakjsdauiwhuajw

why get this game if you can even mod it without paying for the game all over again pc gaming biggest advantage was the ability to mod with basically difficulty for free valve is trying to take that advantage away with paid mods i wouldnt be surprised if valve scrapped this whole paid mod thing but it will forever stain the name of valve and steam

when i purchase an open world game i expect it to be a game i can keep coming back to for years and while that may have been true it turned out that when bethesda realized there were people still playing their games and there might be a way they could leverage this for money they took advantage of this ability with the help of valve they effectively paywalled my previous save content if i cant download and use the mods that were essential to my previous saves they are no longer functional my saves have been broken because of their greed and hundreds of hours of enjoyment has been sullied by their behavior ive rebuilt my os and while i backed up my saves i can no longer acquire the mods on which they are dependent this is unacceptable and i vow to as long as bethesda stays on this path i will never again purchase a game from this company and when conversation arrises about their projects and their merit i will have nothing but vitriol to say

this game came out in 2011 and now shows its age the only reason to keep playing skyrim is the mods and modding community if you are thinking about buying skyrim you may want to hold off until the modding community sorts out the recent changes if you want to purchase skyrim for the story then go for it there is about 30 hours of decent gameplay quests etc in the game that are worth $15 i got bored once i made it through the main quest line once with a pure magic user and once as a dual wielding barbarian the civil war storyline is interesting but does not change the world as i had hoped there are a few of the main quests that break if you complete the civil war story before the main questline as well it is my opinion that you should pick a side then finish the main quests then come back and finish the civil war events as an open world game skyrim and grand theft auto are the two best examples i have played get the legendary version for $15 or less and enjoy the 3040 hours of decent gameplay if you get the chance to play morrowind and oblivion please do they show their age as well but the game is wonderful and the modding community is fantastic and you can flesh out the lore of the elder scrolls games for not a lot of money

they charge for modding
not recommended
i cannot recommend any game that exploits its community with paid mods by implementing such a system valve and bethesda threaten the core underlying prinicpals of modding a threat looms to take away our personal freedom to modify and play the game as we see fit replacing it with a sanitised system where only valveapproved mods  id est no extreme gore mods drug mods and definitely no sexual mods are permitted paid mods are provided without support no guarantees it wont break now or at a later stage and a refund window of only 24hours which is debatably not enough time to thoroughly test mods especially larger ones the community is being exploited by mod developers suddenly tempted with greed into profiteering and the mod developers themselves are being exploited with a tiny 25% cut for their own work furthermore steams subpar customer support system is woefully inequipped and underpowered to deal with the flood of paid mods produced by their customers which may contain or solely exist of other peoples work capitalism is one thing but i bought this game to mod and play the looming threat to restricting my right to modify my game as i see fit and attemping to exploit modders and the community at large goes beyond simple capitalism and into the realm of exploitation i cannot recommend a game from any developer that bows to greed in such a fashion

paid patches single player microtransactions third party dlc all this and more thanks to valves new paid mod system which seeks to imitate mobile app shops in an attempt to make a quick buck edit as of 4272015 valve has removed paid mods from their workshop but my stance on skyrim bethesda valve and paid mods has not changed and that stance is that once you buy a mod it is no longer a mod rather it becomes a microtransaction regardless of who its creator is microtransactions have no place in skyrim or any other single player game for that matter and the $32 debut pack for a bunch of low quality unfinished cosmetic items is the biggest joke ive ever seen

i wont recommend this game now that steam are charging for mods i had fun with installing graphics mods and new armours and quest that is what is so great about pc gaming the freedom to alter and improve games over time mods have always been some what of a glimmer of hope in the sea of day 1 dlc and preorder bonus crap that has started to flood the gaming industry modders are some of the most passionate and creative people in the pc gaming community they share ideas assets and tools with each other and improve on games we all enjoy this move by steam will tarnish that image

with the hundreds of hours ive spent playing skyrim i can say its well worth every penny but only if you mod the heck out of it those free mods changed skyrim completely transforming it into an incredible gameand thats no longer the case having a great skyrim experience is tailored by mods which is now dlc that costs money and unless you have more money than you know what to do with skyrim simply isnt worth its price tag anymore skyrim with mods is too expensive to justify the experience and skyrim without mods isnt that great of a game for that reason i simply cant recommend this game anymore skyrim was a blast but now all thats left is smoke

i would really really love to be able to recommend this game to people but as of recently i just cant anymore those reasons being quite obvious and many people already pointing out those reasons by allowing the whole pay for mods instead of donating they have essentially killed any kind of longevity that skyrim had by doing this they have caused popular mods one that fix problems with the game and many many more things that improve the game immensely and keep them behind a paywall the only way id recommend this game now is if this all becomes an optional donation or purely free instead but until then i cannot do so

skyrim is an amazing game i have poured hours into so why a negative review well valve has had the brilliant idea to start locking mods behind a paywall i understand mod creators need money but a donation system would have been acceptable selling mods straight up is not that and they are royally screwing modders over by pocketing 75% of the money the mods make so yeah  that practice

one of the main lures to skyrim and pc gaming in general is modding and the hours of endless modding that could happen this could destroy that for all pc gamers in one swoop im not saying modders should not be paid for their mods but the paid mods should be of some significance like say adding 10 hours of quests or something along the lines of immersive armors not an apple that costs 1$ even if you think you are donating to the modder you really are not you are donating to valve being greedy valve takes a 75% cut this is just wrong we were upset at nintendo for taking 40% of youtube content creators revenue and they expect this to be okay the cut should be 10 maybe 20% for the ease of use that you can donate to the mod maker not buy the mod some may say that well its not all valves fault its bethesda too and that is why i am giving this negative revew if bethesda is behind this then they should be the ones who we dont buy games from i will fight for pc gaming i will not allow any greedy company to turn us into a console

this is my first review so let me preface this with the following skyrim itself is an amazing game there is currently no rpg like it besides earlier iterations in the elder scrolls series that being said i cannot recommend this game in good faith i say this because modding is the largest reason why i have come back to skyrim time and time again as i am sure it is the reason so many other people have come back again and again i would venture as far as saying that mods are the only things that keep games alive so long after release especially skyrim after a several month break i was considering playing the game again with new mods recently but upon my opening of steam i discovered this despicable and shallow update introduced by valve who i had once trusted so much and bethesda who i knew was litigious but i didnt know they were asses too with the introduction of paid mods ive stopped playing the game in fact i cant play the game all of my save files no longer work because a few of the mods i used are locked behind a paywall which i refuse to break down because it is ridiculous that i have to do so in the first place i was infuriated when i learned what valve pays for the mods when they rake in profits 25% to the modders when valve just distributes the game thats practically robbery thats like taking 75% of a taxi drivers income because you built the car even more so that the gestap i mean valve is now temp banning anyone who speaks out against this whole debacle on the forums whats next paid patches to be honest i wouldnt entirely mind paying for mods if a few simple changes were made 1 fix quality control who wants to pay $99 for a pair of horse testicles 2 donations only this is a basic feature nexus has it its much nicer and less intrusivecash grabby 3 pay modders more pay modders more pay modders more do i need to say it again taking 75% of the cut is ridiculous yeah you need to keep the servers running okay thats fine im sure you can do it with 15% or even 10% of the cut 75% are you kidding me valve this is a chance to regain the trust of you former loyal fanbaseconsumer base learn from your mistakes and fix them

this was a 1010 game for me i remember being excited for months before this was released i was so excited to launch this on release day and play it for a week straight now its just been kind of ruined for me with this paid mods stuff paid mods is just a stupid idea to begin with but what makes it worse is that the developer and valve get most of the profit off this  seriously valve and bethesda are some of the last good game developers these days i am really disappointed in them tldr 010 for valvebethesda for paid mod

this really was one of the greats of pc gaming but after 4 years valve  bethesda decided to tarnish its reputation by supporting paidfor modfications to the game even though this idea seems nice note that only 25% goes to the modder and this is a great way for the developers to continue making money from this game absolutely unacceptable and outrageous this will spread to other games if we do not stop this now why i reviewed negatively is due to the reason above and that all my mods that i have had for years are now currently locked unless i pay for them when they were free beforehand if this continues this is my last bethesda game

i bought all the dlc now i have to buy mods here are the reasons that is absolutely stupid 1 mods dont have to work with other mods 2 returning a mod gives me a 7 day market ban really valve 3 shadow bans 4 modders dont have to continue support for mods 5 game updates break mods 6 paying for mods in general 7 modders go into modding not expecting profit 8 gabe newell & bethesda & modders blaming each other 9 modders can steal content from each other 10 i lose more money

before skyrim there was oblivion it was flawed unbalanced dated and had dlc for horsearmour and yet it was still loved because despite these things it was still one of the best games of this genre skyrim is oblivion but without the bad bits i still dont understand why there arent more games like this you are let loose in a massive open world and are allowed to do what ever you want the closest games to it would be mmos or grand theft auto but skyrim is a singleplayer experience youd think that this would make it lifeless and unrewarding but you couldnt be more wrong the entire world is lovingly handcrafted every character you see had to be placed there they had their face personality and clothing picked by a developer of this game and then youre free to come along and end their life with one slash of a blade or not the choice is yours i didnt expect much from this game i had kind of seen through oblivion and it became lifeless for me and i thought that since this was constrained by the same hardware that it wouldnt be a large leap but i was so wrong i couldnt wait to explore every crag and valley simply for the sake of it accompanied by the amazing lotrstyle soundtrack i happily gobbled up the quests and have had countless exciting memories of this game where ive accidentally picked a fight with some one bigger than me or where the game glitches out spectacularly what ever happens its a joy to behold even if youre not a fan of this sort of genre come on who isnt the elder scrolls games are a genre in their own right you need to play this game get it when its cheap and youll more than get your moneys worth even if you only play a fraction of what there is to see and do you can live a virtual life as a fisherman merchant or fighter and unlike the older games which required a bit of imagination to pull off this one has the depth and complexity required to make it enjoyable the downsides the dragons are too easy to defeat though this game has since been patched to include harder ones youll hate it when somebody dies through no fault of your own damn you radiant ai and youre left with an empty shop where you once purchased your stuff youll end up with far too much in your inventory as you plunder tombs and your companions become more of a burden than a help as you level up transforming into mules to carry your rubbish as you battle against the undead but really who is going to be reading this review without an idea of what this game is like who hasnt seen the thousands of mods available for free for this game they make the vanilla 100s of hours of gameplay turn into 1000s youll have no life for weeks after picking this game up in short buy this game

gameplay 910 the gameplay or combat is not perfect as the game can take a turn towards the easier side of things when you start leveling up but that can be easily countered by increasing the difficulty ai are smart as difficulty goes up but its good enough on normal difficulty for it to be fun the skills system is extremely modular and can go which ever way you want making it the ultimate rpg game there is an infinite number of quests that are randomly generated but the normal game content of quests is enough to keep you going for a few hundred hours ui and menu and items from loot to smithing to alchemy are all well done and can be changed or improved on by mods graphics 810 the base vanilla game has some pretty low textures in comparison to some nextgen games and the colour filter of the game is really grey and boring but can be changed yet again with the help of mods with mods the graphics get changed to 1010 sometimes even competing with nextgen games and look even better audiomusic 1010 the voice acting in this game is superb even if you can hear the same voice actor over and over all dialogue is voiced and most npcs have interesting back stories or lines of dialogue you wont start hearing dialogue appear over and over until youve played the game for a couple of hours but it doesnt at all take away from the immersion of the game the music is fantastic and one of the best video game soundtracks ive heard jeremy soule does an amazing job as usual creating a tone and setting for the world of skyirm the game sounds from the world are really well done from the sounds of fire burning away at corpses to the cries of the wolves or bears the ambience of travelling through the forests to the blowing winds of the snow peaked mountains to the ambience of dungeons and the soothing relaxing tone of the taverns skyrim makes no mistakes when it comes to immersing you into the game world through music and audio contentreplayability 1010 the amount of content this game has is far beyond any other game ive ever played with only 2 large dlcs being dawnguard and dragonborn it still manages to have content of which ive never seen before this games size in terms of content could match even that of large scale mmo titles and is not as repetitive as those games due to the fact you can play this game however you want skyrim is the game thatll define a genre of rpg games and bethesda has not compromised much in terms of content in the game overall 9510 no game is ever perfect but the elder scrolls skyrim comes close to being one of the best games over made in my opinion the sheer amount of work put into this extremely immersive world is beyond that of any rpg ive ever played though after a few hundred hours the vanilla game may feel dry to some gamers like myself but due to the fact that skyrim houses hundreds and thousands of mods just makes the experienece even better

you think this is a cool game and worth playing the pirated version is outdated and haves nearly no mod support just like you will encounter by buying this game legitimately because now bethesda and valve decided to make you pay for mods the funniest thing about the mods is that you pay 5 for rain droplets whereas bethesda released an entire dlc for the same price seriously do not buy the game until this gets resolved you know the best part the modder receives only 25% of the money ow hell yes you heard me you are not even fully supporting the author

i have been a fan of bethesda games for a long time and skyrim was truly a masterpiece arguably the best game ever made by the company i played for almost a thousand hours on the console version and i have clocked quite a lot on pc too modding made this game infinitley better modding is why i spent money on a game i had aldready beat on a different console modding is what made me decide to start playing on steam rather than a console modding is what is going to be the downfall of a once perfect game skyrim is one of my favorite games and it will always be but the new paid mods feature is honestly nothing more than valve trying to turn what was a hobby for people and something we all enjoyed for free into money making scheme under the ruse that it is for the modders hard work nexus has a donate button why couldnt they just make one for the workshop because this is not about the modders getting paid for something that is expected to be free when the modders are making more money from their hard work instead of valve then maybe just maybe i will reconsider my thoughts but until then i am going not reccomend this game to anyone who has not already purchased it if there are any and go get a buggy console version of the game because unless this policy changes its only downhill from here

elder scrolls games have always depended on mods to reach their full potential i remember fondly comparing mod totals in morrowind and struggling to keep the game engine from crashing with hundreds of mods working together the mod community has always been something that went part and parcel with the games themselves even i have designed mods for oblivion and morrowind and it was great fun to be a part of it skyrim lacks this free and open access to modding which is a shame because without free and open access the game suffers substantially in addition to graphical and error improvements there were literally thousands of small tweaks you could enjoy with elder scrolls that do not continue in the same way for skyrim shame on bethesda for damaging a successful ip in this way its simply a fact that without free and open mods skyrim truly is not a great game worth recommending choosing to divide the pay wall structure this way results in an inferior product

well after 120 hours of gameplay its time for me to write a review of this game what should i start with theres too much in this game skyrim is full of things to do dungeon to explore quests ways to play classes and weapons theres so much to do and you will always want to do something and forget to do something else epic battles addictive gameplay good storyline and a big free roam world to explore ill try to explain myself with one single word epicness i recommend a lot this game if you want an rpg which mixes exploration battles and much more stuff unfortunately there are some problems for a game of such hugeness there are lots of bugs not so bad they wont ruin the gameplay but sometimes they are really annoying my own vote 8510

ive never had any problems with steam nor skyrim and never really had anything to say about any game really but this workshop paid mods are awful im writing this review because i dont want paid mods i dont recomend this game anymore for anyone if you have a pc nowadays youre fuced basicly the best of pc is doing what you want and having this freedom to mod your games change settings etc if you dont want to see my entire review of the game i think these few lines are wort but from now on ill just say everything wrong i see with paid mods in every game so basicly ill say skyrim is a broken gamewuuuut you say yes i have a good pc and i can play games like gta v with high settings lol and dota on ultra with more than 100 fps and other gamesi just said that 3 so you know how my pc handles some goodgreat graphics games and intense in other ways and skyrim basicly forces you to play under 64 fps and everyone who have a monitor with more than 60hzmost commom are 75hz and 120hz knows that youll have some problems with the game without any modfication other than that aspect skyrim have visible lags when it shouldnt have like youre in a inn and have a lagwuut or youre walking and have some serious stuttering issues the game is made for a slow pc or a console so basicly youre paying money for a game that was made for a console but you have a pc and you know skyrim is greatnot that much without mods because your friends said so or you saw some gameplays and stuff and you want to unbreak this broken game now you have this amazing thing called mod and you have a freaking awesome community that makes mods for everything really there is a moda great one by the way that makes your sneak atack sound change to surprise muthafuca and other mods that change skins game textures add sounds relight the entire fucing game and more so why i think mods shouldnt be paid now is the real deal when a guy spend 100h making a mod or 1h or even 1minute he knew that it wasnt for money he made the mod because hes a great person and want to change the game for better he knew that most people dont even know his name and never will because a commom person just want the mod and thats it now with mods getting money what i thinkand im sure this will happen and ill try to explain why will happen from now on people will do theirs mods upload to workshop and wait for the money in their pockets but that will not happen because youll get a freaking huge enterprise making mods and theyll sell it and man this looks weird but yeah thats called dlcits the fucing dlc problem we had dlcs since the sims maybe even before but now games launchs with a dlc already i remember people bashing mass effect 3 because of the before launchdlc and man now every freaking game a dlc before launch and it sounds im crazy but thats how it works if you dont do anything about it people will get what they want and i know for sure that most people that do mods dont need or dont expect that money because thats how it workednow youll have the iest mods with the highest prices and thatll be fine because you let them do it so just for the information purpose why i think huge enterprises will do the moddlc stuff because what they sell to you is a unfinished game its just a demo a beta a alpha for some gamescoff coff cod coff and they make these dlcs before launch ask you for your money and you pay because you like the game isnt your fault its industry fault now theyll have another type of dlc the mod dlc that will change your entire game you dont know if itll work in your pc if its good if it worth it even but man you dont have your answer if you dont buy it and it only cost 099 right isnt that big of deal now the 099 is 199 then 5 now its 999 and you didnt even notice it they will just make the game like this launching with 1k resolution for textures then 1 month after launch you can buy the great 2k res texture wuuh huuu thats just great right thank if youve read all this sorry if my english isnt the better but if it isnt hope you can at least understand what im talking about

its not that its even a bad idea for the people that legitimately work hard but because valvebethesdas model for this is hey you can do whatever you want im not even going to qa this but were taking 75% of the cut it makes it not worth it for the mod developers theyre claiming to support even the pay what you want denominations are fixed so it takes a bat to the face of the honour system too its almost like being sued in small increments for trying to make a game likeable because youre supposed to feel bad for thinking the vanilla version of this game is  oh and every time you get sued they punch the plaintiff in the  too just for good measure but if you enjoy never touching mods like some sort of crazy puritan youll probably like this game

like many potential customers i have owned this game for years on xbox 360 i had not noticed the steam paid mod controversy until after i purchased this game i purchased a game i have already owned for 3 or 4 years because of the opportunity to try free mods i now regret my purchase the idea that valve and bethesda would charge for something like this is bewildering and the percentage of the profits they keep is as well my biggest issue is the lack of quality control you have no way to determine the quality of a mod before purchasing no way to determine if the next update makes it stop fuctioning mods are mostly made by amateurs even if they are paid this does not mean they have the skills necessary to produce quality mods that will not negatively affect game stability i would never purchase a product with so little guarantee of quality this will inevitably lead to sweatshop goldspammerstyle cheap content that drowns out the quality mods we are used to i have in the past donated my talents to producing mods for the community to enjoy i provided voice overs for multiple dragon age mods i would be far less willing to do this in the future let me add just not buying mods is not a solution the existance of a market in and of itself impacts the quality of content

negative review prompted by valves latest cashgrab labeled as a service to gamers and a godawful way to support modders the modders are only receiving a 25% share of the money spent by players modders have to sell $400 worth of goods before they see even a single cent of their share this atrocious idea has already split modding and gaming communities apart thanks in valve putting $ signs before communities and players once again dont take this as a jab towards the modding communities though even the modders that choose to participate in selling their creations modders everywhere have helped provide an unfathomable amount of custom content to games purely out of their love for games and its players and theyve been generous enough to share their creations for countless gamers many modders are going through hard times now facing morale decisions and fear of public backlash because of this carelessly stupid system to the point that some have been discouraged from continuing their work they have an even unnecessary burden recklessly placed on them of scouring the workshop making sure their freelyshared content is not being sold as someone elses work if you have ever used a mod that youve enjoyed please be sure to extend your thanks and respect to modders everywhere for their dedication and let them know that their work is not going unappreciated

the main problems with paid mods i can think off the top of my head are lack of guaranteed long term support lack of guaranteed compatibility and increased proliferation of cashgrab mods lack of guaranteed long term support means that if any patch comes along that breaks it unless the original modder comes along and fixes it its pretty much wasted money this may not even be possible for something like a dota item you have a reasonable expectation that the item will work even years later you dont have this expectation for mods edit i stand corrected the dota 2 arcanas have apparently been bugged for years ing seriously thats sad lack of guaranteed compatibility means any mod you buy might clash with any other mod effectively wasting your money ive encountered mods that take longer than 24 hours to figure out that they dont work together so the refund in steam dollars doesnt help again with a dota item you have the reasonable expectation that the game will still work even with any combination of them increased proliferation of cashgrab mods has already been seen the poster child for the paid mods scheme the shadow scale set is a single piece of armour and requires that you add it via console no quest no recipe its not even located in the world its also only modelled for male characters and stretches oddly on females i could go on as a lot of the items immediately released are little better theres probably other problems i havent thought of but even at first glance this seems like a terrible idea edit 2 with the removal of paid mods this review is no longer very relevant but let it stand as a mark of what valve tried to do and a warning good game but paid mods will likely ruin it

once upon a moon there lived a khajiit called klem klem was not a bad khajiit but klem liked to collect things this is a story of klem collecting things klem had come into a land called skyrim in klems quest for the collection of things and because of the  legion imperial scum klem had lost all of the many things klems had collected but that is not this story and so klem had to begin klems collection anew the legion scum had even attempted to kill klem but that is not this story and whats more sometime in klems recent past in a story that is also not this story klem was found to be a thing called dragonborn and because of this klem was given a servant called lydia klem was not sure how this happened but klem was glad for lydia could carry many things though she did not seem to like klem very much klem needed a place to store the many collections of things that klem planned to acquire klem had lost all of klems things and coins and the local places were far more costly than the coins klem had and so klem decided to earn coins doing favors for the locals these favors bade klem west and so that is where klem and lydia set paw very soon klem and lydia came upon a fort filled with bad men bandits they called themselves they were bandit scum klem was smart and thought it wise to avoid such men that called themselves this and so klem carved a wide path around the fort however the bandit scum were quick to attack regardless of klems unprovocations and lydia was quick to reciprocate and klem felt it klems duty to join lydia in her reciprocation klem and lydia fell the bad bandit scum with much mightiness the scum fell easily before the might of klem and lydia what wonderful moons that blessed klem and lydia that day whats more the bandits had things many things shiny things and not so shiny things and klem was smart and had an idea klem need not collect all of the things klem could sell some of the lesser things to buy his collection place maybe even this fort would provide enough lesser things to afford the place thus it was that klem and lydia set paw inside the fort in search of more bandit scums and their things inside the fort klem and lydia were sneaky and killed many scums the scum bandits fell easily in this way one and two at a time but they also found a not scum inside there was a nice nord lady that gave talk and niceness and klem was not a bad khajiit so klem and lydia let the nice nord lady be soon klem and lydia came upon a mighty bandit scum that called itself thug bandit thug bandit was very mighty indeed and hurt klem time and again one swing of thug bandits mighty twohanded hurty thing made klems head go fuzzy like too much skooma the battle was hard fought and very long and it took lydia distracting thug bandits attention while klem shot thug bandit with arrows for thug bandit to fall the mightiness of klem and lydia had vanquished the entire bandit band and klem was glad and gave thanks to the moons and relished in klems victory and all the many things klem had won but klem and lydia could not carry all the things there were too many things but whiterun was still in sight and klem was smart and klem had another idea klem decided to return with lydia to whiterun to sell all the things klem and lydia could carry klem planned to quickly return to the fort to collect the rest of the things klem was amazed at klems smartness klem had not finished exploring the fort however and klem was most curious about the unknown upstairs and so klem ran with most haste to whiterun and klem and lydia ran with such speed that even the deer were amazed however when klem returned the  legion emperial scum had taken over as if they had been waiting to move in the fort was completely renovated by the imperial scum and all klems hard won things were gone all of the things whats more the  scum had gall enough to tell klem that klem did not belong that klem should leave but this was klems hardwon fort klem was not a bad khajiit but klem had lost all his hardwon things and so klem was angered and klem decided to take the legion scums things as payment and so once again klem and lydia were sneaky in the fort and they took all the things they could carry while avoiding the  legion scums and the nice nord lady was still there serving the imperial scums klem thought that maybe she must come with the fort certainly klem could not leave without exploring the unknown upstairs and satiating klems curiosity and so klem went to the unknown upstairs to find that the  imperial captain had made it his own place and as klem was looking and wondering what the unknown upstairs was like when it was the mighty and worthy thug bandits own place the  legion captain attacked klem for trespassing this was klems hardwon fort and klem was being attacked by the  legion imperial captain scum but captain scum was no match for mighty klem and  captain fell easily and captain scum had so many things for klem to take and klem was no longer angered klem and lydia went downstairs to leave the fort while carrying all the things klem and lydia could carry the  soldiers were still hostile however and one of them attacked klem for trespassing soon all the  soldier legion scum were attacking klem and lydia many soldiers at least 8 but they were no match for mighty klem and lydia even 15 against klem and lydia or maybe it was 25 mighty klem and lydia vanquished them all klem no longer wondered why the  legion imperials had moved in with such haste certainly they had been no match for the mighty thug bandit and they needed a mighty warrior like klem and lydia to vanquish the bandits before they could move in klem decided the  legion scums deserved the death they received and klem was glad then it was time for klem and lydia to gather all the hardwon things to collect and sell but this time klem took no chances and weighed klem and lydia down with everything in the fort all of the things all of the many imperial things and it was a very long and tiring and laborious short trip to whiterun and that is the story of how klem bought klems collection place

skyrim is the best elder scrolls game so far with the expansions it has gotten even better i felt that esiii morrowind brought more to the table for its time than esiv oblivion but believe this game has done even more i have enjoyed it on console on pc and gone through the dlc which is worth the extra cash the only thing missing is coopmulti player but elder scrolls online is running now although i wish they would have done things a little differently on that game even if your not an elder scrolls fan or follower the game is a nice play as it allows you to customize yourself and play in many styles to allow a change up i did have a few technical issues following the main quest line but just shifted to side quests and other things until i found out how to fix my save they could have done a litle better on updating to debug some of the common issues or allowed a form of abandoning quests to reset them overall id say 9510 for what it is as i cant complain about missing features that just werent supposed to be in the game although i think they coulda just put out a coop patchexpansion to allow us to play with 1 friend or something which would have enhanced the gameplay alot and expanded the games popularity

what can i say i love this game you can do whatever you want i think the elder scrolls series is one of the only rpgs that is truly open world dont want to do the main quest go ahead and wander the big and well crafted world feel like you need some directions to start your new adventure do one of the many side quests you can make your own armours potions and weapons though they removed the ability to make your own spells now the big question is it better then morrowindoblivion my answer is no although skyrim is amazing it does not have the same fantasy feeling i got while playin morrowind or oblivion 810 a must own for pc gamers

skyrim yeah i played skyrim picked it up when it launched on the xbox 360 in fact i mustve put about 30 hours into it before deciding that ive seen it all let me break it down a bit when i played skyrim i did the following i left my house found a dungeon grabbed the loot sold it to the same handful of merchants including my husband andthat was it morrowind was surreal wonderful and just obtuse enough to be charming with skyrim i felt like some cog in a dwemer machine trapped in an endless cycle of middling upgrades and a total lack of surprising events i mean for crying out loud more dragons these jerks are worse than cliff racers at the time i figured that i might as well play an mmo at least then i could get some rare drops so what happened whats so different about the pc version that i would put 600 hours into it do you really have to ask modding skyrim is the equivalent of alice in wonderland you dont get to walk up to the rabbit hole and peer over the edge you certainly cant climb down take what catches your interest and climb out no you will fall in that hole the only light youll be seeing is through the dozens of mods that make up your sunny days in skyrim in the beginning you might pick through the mods available on the steam workshop a weapon here a new set of armor something that makes cows explode or sends people flying into space you get the idea but then you look at what other people are doing with their skyrim theyve got the 4k textures the dramatic enbs the glamour models with their noses just right now you may be thinking that you dont need all that garbage and you probably dont but you do next thing you know youre on the nexus its been 10 hours and you havent even started the game yet stability is the last word id associate with elder scrolls and thats without piling on the mods getting your modded game to function is more engrossing than skyrim itself youve started the game youre wandering around and thencrash to desktop what caused it how do you fix it is there a way around it are you going to lose your saves after a long enough period of time you eventually stop caring my skyrim is held together by old tape and chewing gum and thats fine eventually you learn to stop caring about those precious gamesaves im going to spoil skyrim you are the most awesome everything you do is right and nobody dares to question you nobody will even do anything unless youre somehow involved sometimes being the most awesome is fun its escapism at its purest a lot of other videogames tend to punish you with death at worst skyrim inconveniences you this game doesnt say you died or hey poor player it just assumes you goofed up somewhere and loads your last save theres something to be said about playerimposed difficulty but its hard work trying to be the least awesome theres a phrase i like to throw around when discussing videogames making the game yours usually this refers to playing games in a particular way like a knifeonly run in resident evil or beating megaman without any powerups its not always about playerimposed difficulty either it can be about creating an identity through playing i remember reading about a morrowind player who spent all of their time in the ashlands theyd camp out in a chitin hut and hunt whatever beasts they happened to find they made just enough from selling the carcasses to eke out a miserable existence while dealing with the constant ash storms this doesnt sound appealing but i have to respect the hustle that person totally owns their game of morrowind when all of the rumors are true and the player is always the most awesome theres not a lot one can do to create their identity this is especially apparent when every single guard you pass mentions something you could be doing or have already done your alteration level could be so low that it couldnt levitate an earthworm but that wont stop you from becoming an archmage not long after stepping foot in the winterhold college i remember when being an archmage was such hot  in the bards tale now its just a title any dragonbum can get when everything in a game takes zero effort and the results are meaningless why not just make the game in your image through modding if anything this will lead to new challenges more possibilities and gasp unpredictability when i play skyrim i play with the intent to fill it with as much crap as i can find see ifwhenhow it breaks and attempt to undo the damage with minimal losses its disturbingly compelling and thats without discussing the mods themselves i dont settle for being the most awesome i want to become omnipotent only after ive constructed this world filled it with all of the neatest toys and prettied it up as much as my mediocre videocard will allow do i actually play it at this point im fine with being the most awesome because i feel like i earned that right this is the time i put some genesis on and zone out while exploring decapitating and working on that perpetually imperfect nose perhaps my comparison to alice in wonderland is a bit off the way i remember it alice falls in the hole and arrives in wonderland with modded skyrim wonderland is a neverending hole inevitably youll get bored of tearing your game to pieces and putting it back together you want to see where your curiousity will take you you might go digging through hundreds of foreign websites to find that anime fightingstyle or ten gigabtyes of hairstyles you could even find yourself in a lab what it all comes down to is that skyrim is what you make of it the game is fine on its own its certainly not lacking for content and even without thousands of visualenhancing mods it looks decent however skyrim becomes so much more simply through the act of modding to me this is the ultimate sandbox game and will likely only be bested by bethesdas next singleplayer rpg

the base game is not nearly as good as it is with mods and now all the lovely mods that made the game great are behind a paywall if modders wanted to get paid   why did they bother making all these mods for free in the first place i am not going to support this and i never will a donate button yes a paywall never enough said

game the elder scrolls v skyrim genres rpg adventure open world fantasy personal rating 1010 why is this game good midna skyrim is a game that brings hours of gameplay for a very small price the world is beautiful the quests bring a challenge to every player and so on in my opinion skyrim has to be one of the best rpg games out there because you can do so much once you finish the main game quests you can still continue to play this game as there are missions that randomly come up when you speak to characters if you dont like skyrim how it is you can modify it steam has a skyrim workshop and you can change the way your world looks you can also visit the nexus website which is where a lot of people post their mods in skyrim you can have followers that will follow you into the darkest depths of skyrim they can help you fight or they can fight for you they can even live with you in your home you end up getting a lot of homes in most of the cities in skyrim my favourite is my house in solitude which is in my favourite city i promise you now that the only way that this game will annoy you is if you download too many mods and your game crashes thats happened to me a lot now that i have finished the main quests in skyrim i just roleplay and live in solitude i live with jessica alba a mod i take a lot of screenshots of skyrim and post them on steam for everyone to see please go and buy this game its simply amazing thanks for reading

boycotting steam workshop going to get all my mods from the modders themselves its an appauling the middle man is taking such a massive cut this is not helping the modders as they have to charge even more just to get 1 buck this is profiteering from other peoples creativity anyone who buys a mod from the workshop is encouraging this exploitation games awesome valve has sunk to its lowest
not recommended
so this is a good game but the upcoming mod workshop has valve taking a whopping 75% of the profit from original content that mod makers sell so picture this you make an expansion for skyrim yourself and put it on steam workshop and make say $500 with it of that $500 you will only see $125 the rest is split between bethesda and valve similar arrangements to these like google play or the apple app store see a 6040 split in the developers favor the workshop is set up 2575 in store owners favor i dont have a problem seeing mod makers get paid but claiming that this is a tool to empower burgeoning young gamemakers is a lie 25100 would not mod

latest game in the elder scrolls series prior to elder scrolls online many elements of the game have been dumbed down andor streamlined for more casual gamers to get into it if you ignore all the great things from previous games though this game stands on its own merits as a fun romp through a sandbox world the singlular reason to buy this game on steam rather than on the console is the capablity to be modded check the steam workshop and the nexusmods for details on that you are in control  you can change the difficutly at any time you can install whatever mods you want to make the game more enjoyable anything you want you can do if you want to challange yourself legendary difficutly  difficutly enhancing mods exist if you want it easy then novice difficutly lets you hack and slash your way through the story and of course there are all shades in between swords maces bowscrossbows shields dual wielding magic and more play the way you want thats the name of the game your experience is what you make of it imagine you are in a story and play that way

god i loved this game to death and for the longest time i have recommended to many friends as a good game to just  around on since it had so many amazing mods but now with the implementation of paid mods and the threat of further implemenation to other potentially just as amazing games i cant recommend this game to anyone now im scared at how much this has schismed a once helpful and active community of a fairly old game i agree with the many thousands of other like minded indviduals that say this paywall is horrendous and that it should be removed and replaced with a donation button instead valve should keep its greedy hands out of something that has been free since it started mods have turned many games into bestsellers and made many buggy games into easier to play tolerable messes without mods many games would never have reached there level of fame they have why bethesda and valve would want to ruin this and how much it has helped them is beyond me hopefully we can make them see the error of their ways once we have i will change this review to the one this game deserves

like most bethesda games skyrim is only mediocre when played without mods with mods the games cool factor rises a million times over mods let you change almost every element of the game adding immeasurable fun and replay value with that said this is going to be a negative review because bethesda and valve have enabled a system where modders can now sell their mods on steam this act has already led to some modders pulling their mods from free sites like nexus why is it a bad thing for modders to be paid for their work because thats not what modding is all about i also mod but i would never charge someone for something that is essentially done for fun and with the notion of sharing with others modding has always been something done by the fans of a game for other fans of the game for companies like steam and bethesda to try to monetize that is nothing more than greed and get this the modders only recieve 25% of what they charge for their mods guess who gets the other 75% this move sets a really bad precedent for things to come you may not play skyrim but what if valve started doing this to all their games modders for all games could potentially start charging people and then the whole modding community would just turn into a huge market that nets big money for greedy corporations so though i had fun with it in the past i do not recommend skyrim to anyone its your call to get it but when the only thing that makes the game any good is about to become paid dlc thats when the game turns foul in my mind

vanilla game is somewhat fine but i cant recommend this game in good faith sadly valve and bethesda decided they need to get 30% and 45% on the work from the community who only get a measly 25% pay mods are wrong so is getting 75% of someone elses work for hosting it and will lead to countless abuse from people trying to make some cash the first few paid mods are already mods that stole assets from other games mods that were pulled from other sites at no benefit in quality the only people profiting from this are valve and bethesda please do not validate their business practice do not buy their products for as long as this system exist

with valve and bethesda making a move to destroy one of the greatest aspects of pc gaming the modding scene this week turning mods into 3rd party dlc that has none of the quality assurance compatibility testing or support that an official product has yet 75% of the revenue goes to valve and bethesda i urge everyone reading this review to not buy skyrim ive owned the game since launch i own all the dlc ive played over 200 hours and basically done nothing in the process with countless free mods but what valve and bethesda are doing with the paid workshop is pathetic and terrible for consumers and the pc gaming community do not support it with your money

edit valve and bethesda have decided to listen to the community and have scrapped the paid workshop at least for now i applaud them for taking down the paid workshop and as such have regained some of my trust however i will be leaving my review as not recommended to serve as a reminder original honestly this game is good but because both valve and bethesda have decided to introduce a paywall for mods i can no longer recommend skyrim i urge everyone who doesnt own the game already to refrain from buying this game bethesda and valve have also lost a customer and i refuse to purchase anymore of their games unless they reverse their stance on paid mods

quite possibly the greatest game ever made by mere mortals the elder scrolls v skyrim takes you on a journey through skyrim a province of tamriel the dragons have returned and as the dragonborn its your mission to send the lizards of the sky back to where they came from with a good main storyline accompanied by terrific side quest lines and dlc all backed up by a lore which comes a close second to the fallout series this game really does have the perfect base for a singleplayer game the gameplay is also fun and very rewarding with 6 different difficult levels as well as numerous playstyles to try youll never play the same game twice but thats not why you buy skyrim for pc the modding community is what you buy skyrim for with one of the most dedicated and skilled mod communities going this game can have almost anything you could possibly want and more the best bit is thanks to the programs available modding your game couldnt be easier to mod and thanks to the creation kit you to can get in on the action the verdict gameplay 810 story 710 lore 910 replayability 1010 graphics unmodded 710 graphics modded 1010 overall rating 95 el k

this game is honestly the best game ive played ive sat down and played countless hours on the elder scrolls games but this tops it off a great follow up and so much better than elder scrolls online that was recently released as the next in the series if you are skeptical of this game still im not done yet there are thousands of hours of modding put in by a dedicated modding community that adds around 1000 hours of new content just by using the mods from the workshop if youve looked at the workshop and it doesnt look big with only 10000 mods you have the nexus with over 30000 that adds so much to your game and if you have complaints there is a mod for it that changes it and makes your experience amazing and fully immersive the game challenges you to patience and choosing the right moment to do things and it really adds in an immersive way of living in the elder scrolls with full ability to extend your abilites in the largest scale open world map ever made you can slaughter a city of the rebels  the stormcloaks or delve deep into dungeons recovering powerful artifacts that can help you on your way to the top of the chain as your progress your story the way the people of skyrim treat you differentiates you can slay a dragon and they start to say youve slain a few dragons in your time or when you become the whisperer of the dark brotherhood you find npcs every so often that use the dark brotherhood greeting hail sithis there is a whole new experience to everything you have ever experienced in a game buy the game

there are many reasons why we play games some play games to experience a story some play to compete with others and some play to have experiences they have never had otherwise in real life alot play games to escape into another world and live completely different lives and this is what drives bethesdas elder scrolls series a series that has excelled in creating complete virtual worlds inviting the player to live parallel lives skyrim is the latest world offered by bethesda to live in and it seems like its bethesdas finest accomplishment yet similarly to the two elder scrolls games before it you start off as a prisoner and this case you are on your way to be executed just before the axe greets your neck a dragon appears and the entire army base you were in goes into disarray you are set free after the incident and it is up to you to find out why are the dragons appearing and what is your role in the whole ordeal hint it rhymes with shmagonborn bethesda displays such dedication to concept of open world that makes other open world games pale in comparison skyrim isnt just a series of buildings environments and npcs it is the closest there is to virtual living world in a game the sense of freedom found in elder scrolls is unparalleled and skyrim is the best implementation of this yet the main quest is a minimal part of the game and most of the fun comes from exploring the world built for you as you go exploring dungeons assisting npcs with their problems joining factions and reading ingame books you realize what a dense world skyrim is it is compelling to learn more about skyrim about its citizens and about its politics and the more you learn about the more you are invested in the well being of the world through all the running around and exploring you come across a wide range of missions to complete the main mission is as usual the most interesting one but the rest of the missions can be worthy and they are necessary to help you know more about the world you can complete missions for the companions skyrims equivalent of the fighters guild to understand how ingrained the warrior culture is in skyrim or join the mages college and be looked down upon by nords who believe that magic is for sissies even miscellaneous missions such as simply standing up for a dark elf against a bunch of racist nords can be satisfying standard fetch quests are to be found here and there but there are far from being the norm the games graphics have been talked about endlessly now skyrims graphics are great with detailed textures and wonderful environments yet it terms of detail they dont hold a candle to games like rage and battlefield 3 yet skyrim is nicer to look at than the aforementioned games and that is because of skyrims aesthetics bethesda knows that when it comes to graphics art direction trumps fidelity and in skryim the beauty of the world comes from its style part of the reason morrowind is generally viewed as a much better game than oblivion is because of its fantastical designs while oblivion came off as a standard european fantasy setting morrowind was a truly outlandish and exotic location that had its own unique identity skyrim returns with the art direction that made morrowind so unique while the location might not be as exotic as morrowind skyrim it is exactly the blistering norse region that you would think is occupied by burly warfaring people the buidlings the environments the apparel the weapons the creatures and even the music all give skyrim its unique identity an identity that is inspired by reallife scandinavia but is in no way identical to it  the combat which is one of the weaker aspects in previous elder scrolls is drastically improved here while there is still the feeling that you are hacking away at empty spaces instead of making a real impact on your enemy but its not as bad as it was in previous games the biggest addition to the combat system is the double wielding and it works great you can go for a sword in each hand a sword and spell or two spells one in each hand i personally went sword and staff gandalf style there is also a favorite menu for items a feature that pauses makes it easier to equip items in game this is designed to save you the hassle of going to the main item screen during the game but it also gives a tactical quality to the combat since the menu pauses the game and allows for quick equipment changes which is helpful especially when fighting dragons dragons appear as random encounters throughout the game and they are just as imposing as one would imagine dragons to be you will die alot fighting them and you would have to rely on myriad of tactics to fight them a few hacks there retreat to heal yourself attack with destruction magic while the dragon is airborne retreat again and so on killing a dragon is immensely satisfying and through killing dragons do you acquire new shouts shouts are another new combat feature they are words in the dragon language which when you say them unleashes different attacks on your enemies or gives you new powers shouts are a welcome addition to the games combat system and further adds to the combats tactical quality now this is a bethesda game which means that bugs are abound i have experienced a few unresponsive actions from npcs same crashes and an axe suspended in midair however this is an area i cant criticize bethesda much about in a game of this size and scope it is virtually impossible to spot all the bugs before release to their credit bethesda is quick to releases patches that fix whatever issues gamers may have we can also count on the mod community to tweek all the inconveniences out of the game bugs are abundant in the game and players will experience at least one in every playthrough yet for the most part these bugs are miniscule and far from game breaking skyrim is like a music album that has a few tracks that you arent particularly fond of but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you cant help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible i cant point to a single part of the game and say that is the best part the entire game is an experience it stays firmly rooted in elder scrolls gameplay yet with enough improvements and additions and subtractions to make skyrim stand on its own after experiencing the vast dense and incredibly detailed world of skyrim you cant help but snicker whenever another game is referred to as open world good vast yet incredibly detailed world incredible depth interesting story improved combat system gorgeous graphics and wonderful style bad buggy some standard fetch missions price aed 9510

i played the absolute crap out of this game on console and happily purchased it on pc again to experience it with mods this game is fantastic but what keeps me coming back to it is the amazing mod community however that is now all in the past now you have to pay for mods and the community is broken im sad to see this happen to such a beloved game and for such wonderful companies to sink so low if you love this game or any modded game please considering donating to them through paypal and skipping the 25% for the creator mess that steam has created everything should be optional paid and at the least 50% of revenue to the modders for shame steam please do not support this microtransaction trend it hurts you it hurts the gaming community i highly reccomend checking out the nexus creators forecast and response to this whole ordeal here httpwwwnexusmodscomskyrimnews12449 and the forecast here httpwwwnexusmodscomgamesnews12444  it paints a clear and concise picture of how this hurts the community and how many issues can arise with such an action if this whole scandal blows over i will happily change my score but until then my review remains unchanged be weary travelers

i could care less about skyrim at this point but i would love to see how a 75% cut to valve is justified in this whole paid mod venture
not recommended
making mods dlc is a disgrace towards everything valve has stood for towards everything the prior elder scrolls games have been and to the community that have made these games what they are you make me sick
not recommended
the move to allow mod creators to charge money was awful it goes against everything that modding games has been about valve itself exists thanks to the modding of games 75% of the money goes mostly to valve and the game developer the mod author gets 25% and only after they make their first 100 bucks this is awful just no skyrim has a lot going for it its very fun mods are nice etc etc but bethesda has made a very clear statement about what they want to do with future games

never would have thought that i have to rate this as a no but things change thanks valve & zenimax

this is one of my favourite games of all timemostly because of the fantastic modding community therefore i can no longer recommend it because of the addition of paid steam workshop content this will be a disaster for the modding community  it will stifle collaboration and innovation and encourage uninteresting and stolen content this will slowly or quickly choke the life from a wonderful community

skyrim is the perfect example of how a vast and addictive adventure game is done without overloading the player with witcherlike  complexity you begin the game picking only your race and from then what type of fighter you are is completely built off of how you play making for endless possibilities of the fighter you can become it is a poor idea to just stick to the main story all throughout because it will leave you at a disadvantage if you ignore the varying side quests and beautiful exploration which allow you to uncover some of the best equipment as well as enhance your skills and levels this in turn has given me a massive playtime of 37 hours so far and the main story still only feels like its a quarter of the way through this is a fantastic watercooler game allowing for you and your friends to share hours of stories about your unique adventures and play style in skyrim if you have the system specs and you love exploration do not miss this game

the role playing game that arguable defined the genre for this past generation of consoles the ps3 and 360 left me in awe once i finally broke away from it 75 hours from the start it wasnt just an enhanced version of the hit success oblivion it was an entirely new game so it was obvious not to have any ridiculously high expectations for the game going into it the only thing the game suffered from was a cookiecutter by the books approach to the game for instance the opening scene of the game was supposed to be a worrisome one youre next in line to get your head axed off in a public execution yet i wasnt scared atrocious acting and roboticlike animations sickened the characters around me the intensity that the situation was supposed to deliver was crushed but storytelling has never been bethesdas strong suit and neither was it a high priority going into skyrim they wanted to create an experience that the players would never have to leave something they could come back to and constantly have something to do a place to explore a mystical world taken from our imaginations that brought our mythical fantasies of dragons and castles to life before us and they did just thatskryims landscape is vast while it may look small on paper getting from point a to point b could take up the better part of an hour or more if you get lost in the excitement of discovery and getting lost in your imagination to go and see what may be just around the corner or in that cave just up the hill the world constantly has something for you to do whether that be exploring questing crafting hunting dragons and other mystical beasts or even starting up your own family and home but it was the frequency at which i obtained new quests that always kept me on my feet at one point i had 19 main quests and 45 side quests all active at once i just couldnt stop getting things to do everywhere i went no matter who i talked to someone always had something for me to do quests would even pop up in front of me while i ventured out to accomplish another task only adding to the lengthy list i had drawn up already even when i tried to avoid civilians at all costs they still managed to nag me to do things for them via messengers that would hand me documents with news quests the cool part was that most of the quests rewarded me well for my hard work and most of the quests that i had garnered all had their own uniquely scripted story thread many of which tied into the main conflict at hand which involved me cleansing the kingdom of dragons but the main campaign itself was still superbly penned even with the hundreds of side content stories to embark on perhaps the coolest part about the quests however was how every one of them purposefully took me to a new area on the map that i hadnt yet been to before the game wanted me to explore and see new things i didnt just get a handful of chores to do in a single nearby quarry or dungeon everything was spread out and unique unto itself and for the most part none of the areas suffered from the problem oblivion had where many of the dungeons and areas in the game were composed of copied textures simply pasted into the game from other areas every nook and cranny of skyrim is unique and differentif you hadnt already known every character you create is dragonborn from the start meaning he or she can cast powerful magiclike shouts that are one of your biggest weapons at hand when confronted by a dragon yet they can also be used against other enemy types as well the extensive variety of spells and shouts is extensive to say the very least and i had a blast getting to experiment with the different elemental types such as fire ice and electricity the games new perk system also made experimenting with different skill types a joy as well with just a few clicks of the mouse i could upgrade my efficiency with one handed swords or have increased my maximum health i could have even changed my list of magical weapons or upgraded a specific attack the combat in the game was a huge improvement over its predecessor as well enemies can no longer be exploited like before in oblivion where you could simply backpedal and fire spells at foes as they helplessly trampled along after you the enemies youll face in skyrim move significantly faster when than your backpedaling character when they go out on the attack all in all the combat system was very well put together swords clashes upon one another and bounced of shields and thanks to the ability to multitask with your magical powers you can cast things such as healing spells on the go in the middle of a fight to save you from death the biggest problem with skyrim though is the same that has affected every other elder scrolls game bugs while bethesda has delivered a much more stable game this time around it didnt stop me from having to reload previous saves on numerous occasions and if youre one of those players who hates to save every ten minutes or you just simply forget the games auto save functionality is probably a life saver to you although it isnt perfect the thought of erased victories over deadly dragons and lost character development may sound like a nightmare to some but heck for a veteran of the elder scrolls series its simply something ive come to expect now

this game is not a love it or hate it its a love it and hate it sometimes while playing i think to myself this is the game its just a dream come true is it real but the next moment it might change to this is the most stupid waste of time ive ever paid for first of all it is huge it is enormous ive done 300 hours into it and im still in the middle of the main quest its got everything fights spells potions horses dogs children marriages dragons clothes bookcases treasure maps grocery stores pagan worshipping war armageddon waterbreething dead naked sorceresses in bikinis mysterious ancient civilisations glowing mushrooms mammoths zombies and lots lots lots of bugs it is very beautiful especially at night when you see the northern lights shining but also very ugly when the low and high resolution textures are messing up in front of you its got so many quests tasks characters and places i think even developers dont know them all it is a gem for those who like to explore and discover the territory for themselves each cave has something in it each ruin might conceal a secret each village might have a mystery to uncover the freedom of choice given to the player is unnatural you can be a werewolf a vampire a mage a warrior an archer a thief an assassin a blacksmith a miner an alchemist on top of the dragonslayer and the chosen one and most of that you can be at the same time this schizophrenic development of the character results in a no less chaotic gameplay you have swords bows daggers maces spells magic staffs magic scrolls and dragon shouts all of which you can use as weapons you meet all sorts of enemies and youre free to deal with them by any means you prefer there is no special weapon for a giant you dont really have to use spells against a mage moral choices are also a blur there is no proper or right way really you just do stuff and get stuff happen as a result its not a bad thing to use conjuration spells necromancy is not punishable poisons are as legal as healing potions there is no white or black magic sometimes its impossible to understand if youre doing good or bad i think the only thing that stops freedom from being absolute is the quests if developers would remove the quest lines as such turning them into a mass of random tasks you can perform in any sequence at any time and preferably at any place with any character it would make the game a triumph of freedom and a complete mess so skyrim is a beautiful ugly strict messy very stupid and very clever game which everyone should play at least once on the easy level it is almost casual no effort is required to deal with the fights it can be played on a mac through crossover but it is sluggish no matter how low the graphics settings are

this is the game the never ever ends i picked this game up thinking i wouldnt like it having never played a previous tes game before sat in my library untouched for about a month or two and finally took the plunge i was wrong i was so very very wrong this is probably the best purchase ive ever made on steam add in the unlimited potential of modding and its an adventure that continues forever ive probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character and still only have beaten alduin once once theres still so much more do to and explore that im still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things i still cant believe how much there is to do and im still finding more at it stands ill probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as skyrim with how much ive played and im totally ok with that

i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun one of skyrims major cities when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot an orcish mace in the other they were on display for nobody but me and my computercontrolled housecarl lydia who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls dragons a civil war and job assignments that never seem to go as planned its even a sensible thing to do a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim one of the most fullyrealized easily enjoyable and utterly engrossing roleplaying games ever made part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated in skyrim theres no more moonhopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill thats gone so is athletics the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major you dont assign major and minor skills at all but instead pick one of ten races each with a specific bonus high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective closerange combat these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic sneaking and weapon combat emphasizing firsthand experience over instruction manual study letting you specialize only when youre ready it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim do a quest kill a dragon snatch torchbugs from the air munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within little feels random and useless even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities making every step you take even if its through what seems like total wilderness an exciting one as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame momentarily all on the battlefield unite directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature creating impromptu moments of camaraderie  a surprising change from what may have been yet another bythenumbers bandit camp sweep dragons show up often their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles stops to attack circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv can be completed in a few minutes and always offer a useful reward killing a dragon yields a soul which powers skyrims new shout system these are magical abilities any character can use you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time throw your voice change the weather call in allies blast out ice and fire or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force even if you favor sword shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story joined with the thieves guild fought alongside the dark brotherhood or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim not only is this land under assault by dragons long thought to be dead its also ripped in two by civil war you can choose one side or the other but so much of the allure of skyrim is how even outside of the confines of quest lines the embattled state of the world is evident and steeped in a rich fictional legacy lord of the rings this is not but with the release of every elder scrolls game the fiction becomes denser and the crossreferencing for longtime fans all the more rewarding skyrims residents are all aware of current events theyll comment on the civil war some sympathizing with the rebels others thinking the establishment sold its soul the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor many characters feel like whole distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans characters stereotype based on race they doublecross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable and they react to your evolving stature within the world it makes a ridiculous realm filled with computercontrolled cat people and humanoid reptiles demon gods and dragons feel authentic like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave

skyrim is one of those breath taking video games that goes on to become a legend the open world gameplay will make the world come alive to you while you are the main character not everyone else revolves around you and your character you will find npc hunting working their day to day jobs children running and playing tag people praying to their gods and much more but you still can interact with them which can start new quests the option to have a follower and more the main quest line alone is a piece of art and will keep you busy for a good bit of time if you really enjoy your social life than this game is not for you because once you start your not likely to stop anytime soon good luck on your new adventure hero and dont forget to check out the mods for this game there are quest mods to add even more gameplay hours new weapons player homes new worlds and even exploding chickens

skyrim is awesome whilst working on a quest you find a note in the world that makes you pursue another quest this goes on until you no longer remember what your original goal was that is the beauty of skyrim and elder scrolls exploration rewarding gameplay choices you are not given as much freedom in choices as you were in morrowind though and funny  bugs that have always defined elder scrolls to me

wow the only word that i can use to describe this game is misleading i have over 320 hours on this game and i have yet to even see the skyrim ive tried googling the location of the rim but to no avail this game doesnt even have helicopters to use to even get to the rim like wtf activision fix your game this is the biggest waste of 74 euros ever i even installed the beautiful males mod because i got tired of looking at battlefield to get me off and that doesnt even do it the  physics are atrocious no flopping no particle effects nothing why would you put naked men in the game if it isnt even arousing i guess the snow is ok but nowhere near the quality of the snow in that one level of call of duty i cant remember which one though graphics  210 gameplay  110 waaayyyy better on consoles  physics  210 left too much to the imagination snow  610 im being generous with this one overall  1010  a fantastic game with an amazing storyline you can play it fer dayz

cool game tough you should totally use mods once youre done with the main quest also like oblivion it feels way simplier than previous installements you should get it but be aware that if youre a fan of previous games you should play at higher difficulty levels since this game is so much easier than previous ones id make a fus roh dah joke but that shout isnt even the best one so

its inevitableonce you start a bethesda game the time invested is going to be high time investment is one thing that makes me procrastinate about playing a lot of rpg type games instant gratification through those 20 minute moba or fps matches is so much easier skyrim is the first bethesda game where i focused on the main story and skipped 90% of the side missions although i did have fun with the campaign i regret that decision its partially because the first play through in these type of games is rarely if ever optimal unless you obsessively plan ahead the character you think you might want to play as in the beginning usually takes a sharp detour about half way through the game that and just learning how all the features perks and leveling work usually involves a lot of experimentation that rarely goes as planned the other part is because the skyrims main campaign story wasnt as great as i expected it to be now it was indeed a very fine story for sure although i thought the ending was abrupt and anticlimactic based on past experience with fallout 3 and new vegas i had higher hopes of a grand finale and closure im left with a finished campaign with a level 19 character that i didnt really enjoy playing with due to my scatter build had i focused on learning the game mechanics perks and combat aspects first through side missions and experimentation i would have figured out a lot sooner that i needed to start fresh which im sure would have resulted in a much more enjoyable gaming experience skyrim is a worthy experience for those willing to take the time investment plunge unfortunately i wasnt ready to take that plunge one day im sure ill be ready because it is certainly a game worth exploring in all its grand detail

my thoughts about this game this game is just glorious upon my nipples d it makes my nipples burn with joy it gives me happiness and excitement i freaking love this game ive played over 500 hours on it d this game is just the flawless victory trust me buy it d the bugs are basicly the only bad thing but they get patched over time d there are mods to this game also they are the best of almost everything d the dawnguard dlc is just a glorious dlc i love it d the hearthfire dlc is good for the family man the one and only the dragonborn dlc seems pretty impressive and awesome for that matter my grade 910  jimi

skyrim is by far the best video game there is so much freedom so much exploring and you can always find something to do in this game the graphics are incredible which leads to incredible landscape views all the around the world there is plenty of things to fight places to go and things to find there is also hundreds of items in the game  the game is very complex so you may think it is hard to learn but when i played for the first time i got the feel for the game in only days and most i like the mod especialy the kaboobies p i highly recommend this game

great game love playing this in my spare time with great mods and character creation and foes within the game the storyline is vast however completed the campaign in 1 week and the side quests i believe will take months which i will enjoy alot thanks to the steam community for skyrim mods it is great and gives lots of laughs and hours of gameplay muskets new swords and clothes are great to add into the game and my dragonborn is now fully equipped for battle  taken out miraak and now building a good armour set however nothing beats the eleven blades armour and bows
recommended
why are you reading this its skyrim just buy it
recommended
changing my review back to a thumbs up the great split is over thank you valve for being honest and admitting you dun goofed and didnt know what you were doing skyrim is a good game and its greatness is only reflected in its passionate mod community that has stood for over ten years because of bethesdas mod tools perhaps this rough chapter has proven how strong and tight it is in the mod community and how passionate we are about crafting our own fantasy worlds i am back to recommending the game and i forgive valve and honor their honesty in retracting their mess the elder scrolls games have always been rather meh in one if not more categories but theres nothing quite like them in the ability to form your own game because of the countless piles of free content shared by the gamers themselves

first off skyrim is a still a great game that sadly suffers from a number of issues if you have played oblivion you probably will be disappointed in the long run with skyrim because of the gameplay being dumbed in several ways for example the spell system is fun with the dual wielding but sadly they toke out the custom spell making and that was always fun as a mage in oblivion combat is dumbed down alot but it is still decent because the elder scroll games never had the best combat many of the qeusts and characters feel lacking in depth but i did expect this as bethesda isnt the greatest in those aspects of games like this there are still a few good points in skyrim despite the several flaws ive already pointed out such as the better support for mods that bethesda has provided in cooperation with valve workshop is great and the community behind the mods are great as well these add so much gameplay hours that you can get double the hours if you install some mods they even made me rebuy the game on pc with the dlcs dlcs are lacking expect dragonborngreat expansion generally it is way more stable then previous games even though it isnt perfect in this matter despite the flaws of the game it still provides a great way to waste hours and one of the finest sandbox rpgs out there however i recommend oblivion more then this game because of the fact that it is basically this but then way better imo
recommended
the game is very enjoyable but it has its problems the enviroments and the feeling of the world is amazing this is the strongest part of the game the rest is sadly very mediocre the combat is simple and spammy and lacks any serious depth considering its a rpg exploring the world is cool and all but many of the places youll find are generic tombs that all look the same the quests are a gamble some of the questlines are great but some not so much the problem is that alot of the quests are mmo like gather x amount of these items quests these kind of quests i feel do not belong in a singleplayer rpg like this the game also artificially extends the game by having randomly generated repetetive misc  quests at this point the game got really dull and i stopped playing when there was basiclly only these quests left besides all of its faults though it is a game worth playing and many do not seem to notice these things since skyrim brought in alot of people who usually do not play rpgs and has not gathered any pre  expectations the game is overall a pretty dumbed down version from the previous entries in the series which makes me enjoy the game alot less it is a very easy game and is designed for a more casual crowd then morrowind oblivion or even the earlier ones but as i said it is still a fair amount of fun and with an insane amount of mods you could play this for a long time id like to say though that for all people who love skyrim you should atleast give tes iv  oblivion for i feel that some would enjoy that games more deep systems and harder difficulty thanks for reading my rather lengthy review i hope it helped you in your decision for buying the game

i dont think any game can ever replace the feeling i get while playing this amazing is not simply the word that describes skyrim

before writing this review i must admit im a bit biased im a huge tes fan although a general tendency can be noted in which the tes games became a lot easier and more generalized skyrim still is awesome even without mods skyrim is very entertainable and i love the different enviroments you encounter especially on the more eastern part of the map with all the huge height differences just love that place the game just rocks it by the thousands of awesome mods available definitly one of the best games around for me

the newest release of the elder scrolls series skyrim brings excellent graphics and polished gameplay to the forefront of this wonderful new rpg release like all of bethesdas giant openworld rpgs there are plenty of bugs to wade through and have fun with and youll definitely sink way too many hours into this game its fun on a whole new level  bethesda is the best at this type of game and theyve done an unparalleled job once again pros good gameplay beautiful graphics enormous world to explore mod support immersive cons still not as good as morrowind was if you like bethesda rpgs have enjoyed any of the previous elder scrolls games or just love fantasy pick up skyrim  youll love it the immersion is topnotch and youll wander the endless mountains of the beautiful countryside for hours on end truly believing you are the dovakiin i still preferred morrowind more however the graphics and beauty of this game cannot be beat by any of its competitors a

this is the game the never ever ends i picked this game up thinking i wouldnt like it having never played a previous tes game before sat in my library untouched for about a month or two and finally took the plunge i was wrong i was so very very wrong this is probably the best purchase ive ever made on steam add in the unlimited potential of modding and its an adventure that continues forever ive probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character and still only have beaten alduin once once theres still so much more do to and explore that im still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things i still cant believe how much there is to do and im still finding more at it stands ill probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as skyrim with how much ive played and im totally ok with that

i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun one of skyrims major cities when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot an orcish mace in the other they were on display for nobody but me and my computercontrolled housecarl lydia who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls dragons a civil war and job assignments that never seem to go as planned its even a sensible thing to do a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim one of the most fullyrealized easily enjoyable and utterly engrossing roleplaying games ever made part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated in skyrim theres no more moonhopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill thats gone so is athletics the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major you dont assign major and minor skills at all but instead pick one of ten races each with a specific bonus high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective closerange combat these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic sneaking and weapon combat emphasizing firsthand experience over instruction manual study letting you specialize only when youre ready it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim do a quest kill a dragon snatch torchbugs from the air munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within little feels random and useless even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities making every step you take even if its through what seems like total wilderness an exciting one as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame momentarily all on the battlefield unite directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature creating impromptu moments of camaraderie  a surprising change from what may have been yet another bythenumbers bandit camp sweep dragons show up often their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles stops to attack circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv can be completed in a few minutes and always offer a useful reward killing a dragon yields a soul which powers skyrims new shout system these are magical abilities any character can use you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time throw your voice change the weather call in allies blast out ice and fire or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force even if you favor sword shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story joined with the thieves guild fought alongside the dark brotherhood or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim not only is this land under assault by dragons long thought to be dead its also ripped in two by civil war you can choose one side or the other but so much of the allure of skyrim is how even outside of the confines of quest lines the embattled state of the world is evident and steeped in a rich fictional legacy lord of the rings this is not but with the release of every elder scrolls game the fiction becomes denser and the crossreferencing for longtime fans all the more rewarding skyrims residents are all aware of current events theyll comment on the civil war some sympathizing with the rebels others thinking the establishment sold its soul the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor many characters feel like whole distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans characters stereotype based on race they doublecross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable and they react to your evolving stature within the world it makes a ridiculous realm filled with computercontrolled cat people and humanoid reptiles demon gods and dragons feel authentic like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave

you may already know this but back then  i gave skyrim a negative review simply because of the crashes  glitches  issues that came up while playing skyrim although that is still an issue i felt personally my review was unfair to such a masterpiece of a game that and now ive managed to make skyrim far more stable so here i am  making a new one entirely for skyrim to call this game a prime example of how to do open world rpgs is an understatement everything going for it is just brilliant and thought out from lore to the graphics to the combat being improved dramatically over oblivions  i simply feel this game is a legendary edition to the gaming industry as a whole i mean it came out septermber 11th 2011  and still holds strong to this day the amount of mods produced for this game is beyond measure and for good reason you will never finish skyrim or grow bored of it just the vanilla concepts can keep you going for 400 hours and over without a problem even if youve finished the main quest guild quests daedric quests and so forth  there is always something new to do or something to occupy yourself with now include mods of whatever you can imagine and now skyrim has improved two hundred precent like seriously mods can make a difference in how you have fun with skyrim  i certainly have experienced it first hand what i love about skyrim overall is the fact you arent limited in what you want to be  do with yourself any race any build any path you want go right ahead want to be a khajiit monk whom punches bandits into submission you can want to be an orc alchemist who can run at insane speeds thanks to her potions you can want to be a nord who sides with ulfric takes down the empires welcome in skyrim enslave people through necromancy aka thralls and be entirely evil with no good will to spare you can no ones stopping you and skyrim is all about freedom of choice the perk trees are balanced the game has so much for you to do outside of combat that it can be a sims simulator if you think about it npcs have so much to say theres marriage  adoption though without mods to improve those theyre kinda meh while again you will never grow bored of skyrim this game is so important to the community that when valve tried having authors sell their mods we caused a movement called forever free thats quite an impact skyrim made on us especially since its been out for a few years i cannot recommend this game enough heck its dlcs are so full of content that it just adds hundreds of more hours onto your plate even after the main quest for said dlc is taken cared of youll never discover everything and theres so much to do in a game like skyrim apart from the crashes  glitches and issues its a 9 out of 10 game for me

the elder scrolls v skyrim is one of those games that ultimately grants you the freedom to do the things that you can only do in your imaginative mind for example you can kill people in bars villages castles stands anytime you want however you want killing by doing a finishing touch is my favorite part of the game you can have a pet wife build a house and do a lot of varied things though what makes this game better is the mods you can do tons of things with it and do a lot of hilarious crap stunts sex movie scenes and other crazy stuff this game just never ends and theres always things to do even if you dont want to do quests dragons monsters spirits horses women potatoes and stealing things craftily are all huge features in the game now finally dont be like me who waited to buy this game on sale and not pay the full price of it because it is definitely worth your money

years spent developing the elder scrolls v after iv oblivion in 2006 and the work put into skyrim is evident released in 2011 we are no longer able to call skyrim an uptodate game yet it still tricks you in that sense with its breathtaking graphics of which make the world around you feel beautiful whilst still portraying the hard gritty coldness of the snowy nordic homeland the main quest starts with you as a prisoner again in the middle of a civil war between the imperials who had gained control of skyrim and allowed everyone to live there and the stormcloaks who are nordic rebels led by jarl ulfric stormcloak who seem to only want nords in skyrim on the verge of execution you find the dragons have returned and after having narrowly escaped with your life you set out to defeat the dragons finding out you are dovahkiin dragonborn on top of this main quest there are quadrillions of side missions all of which add fresh varieties to your time in skyrim and allow you discover more locations in the world around you you can fight the great war with either the imperials or the stormcloaks you can join the dark brotherhood and assassinate the emperor you can join the college of winterhold and aspire to become archmage the freedom in skyrim is incredible and the developers have made it so that all the decisions you make on your free roaming have an affect on your gameplay and quests take a pilgrimage to the different temples visit all 9 holds join the thieves guild in riften explore hidden caves and burial sites hunt down daedra the world is in your hands then when you have done adventuring for the day buy a house in one of the major cities and sit down to read one of skyrims hundreds of detailed books all giving you more information about the elder scrolls lore and some helping you level up or start a new quest in conclusion i love the elder scrolls v skyrim and recommend it to everyone it is a fantastic game which will allow you hours of enjoyment and whilst it has nice graphics and good gameplay actually is not very demanding in spec my skyrim rating 1010 buy it

this game is huge maybe even too huge for its own good even after 300 hours of gameplay there are things you dont know about and will surprise you but sadly by that time you will feel a bit bored with combat and some other repeating things no worries though with workshop and all the mods you can make skyrim 10 times better game if thats even possible because it already is an ultimate game cosidered to be one of the best of all time

i tend to be wordy in reviews trying to outline my thoughts be fair and also objective this will be no exception bear with me i come into rpg a total noob and what i decree here might for some prove my noobness most probably in fact as a staunch strategysim gamer of many years rpg never really interested me so my adventure into skyrim came as quite a surprise in my view despite its used by date having well and truly expired skyrim deserves some very serious accolades at nearly 100 hours played im still coming to grips that i can play this almost like a sandbox with the hearthfire dlc and just be a simple villager who relies on hunting gathering or even small levels of agriculture to sustain myself or i can be a hero as i write my level 16 char its my 3rd start ok slays dragons gargoyles and vampires he can shout an army of sword wielding skeletons into piles of bones i can wander willynilly all over the map mixing it up with bears wolves and sabretooth tigers there is so so much to do and see that without the fasttravel option or a good horse it would take hundreds of hours just to explore the map im intrigued by the depth and detail of the world and i think this will get 300400 or more hours because i have so much yet to do and see long before i get anywhere near endgame i often stop and setup my character  keeping on eye on the rule of thirds  with awesome backdrops and scenery for some holiday snaps i often walk everywhere instead of using the fast options just to soak it all in i even have some pretty amazing screenshots if i must say so as an enigma music genre fan of many years the music in the background of this is sublime it so often sets either a wonderous emotion or a sense of danger at just the right time so much so that immersion into this pixelated fantasy world is absolutely complete as i write ive finally married the lovely ysolda lydia is my steward and my poorly residence mansion at lakeview manor is looking rather stately it is disappointing that much of the furniture and fittings are nothing more than eyecandy even my long 8 seater dining room table never gets used well i dont have to eat do i for that matter even sleep appears totally optional there are quite a few other peeves too  clipping and fov can be atrocious at times trying to shoot a fast moving dragon with bow and arrow lordy lord  tight tunnels and corners where followers jam you up you cant see or they just get in the way i even killed my follower once in a fit of rage as she stood dumbly by while i was getting zapped by some dude with a cattle prod get out of my way lydia dammit i yelled one day much to the mirth of my wife my real one  inventory items id be the first to recognise penaltyreward for carrying too much stuff but given the tightness and limitations of the purses of scoundrel vendors it took buying a damned house just so i could offload my junk somewhere there is little indication of whats important early on and im carrying stuff that seems rare or difficult to acquire with unknown as its value but im hesitant to leave it behind because its just so much work to get to where i found it  if i need it  books agghhhhh somebody liked writing loads and loads of fictional  and unneccessary trivia thats for sure unless i am sadly mistaken and reaching endgame might prove this the amount of information presented is totally overwhelming i fail to see relevance in much of what is written and trying to piece it altogether into some kind of connected narrative is as good as impossible do i really need to know why edna fatgirl from farawayland abandoned her children for a mammoth or any other such trite historical reference yeah value tells me its important but nohing indicates what isnt important either somehow im supposed to read and remember it all some might say you dont need to read and remember its unimportant i say to that then why have it clutter is bad mmmk  potions spells magic scrolls too much a scroll of reasonable was needed by devs here id rather 2 or 3 gameplay critical potions and maybe 1 or 2 rarer ones but i seem to have more potions and spell options than i do weapon variations im over them tbh 20 or 30 potions of healing is all i carry the rest i dump at the local villages as i travel  missions oh my do they have to stay in the list no i do not want to an imperial or a stormcloak no i dont want to kill the crabby old orphanage maam and sure as eggs are eggs i dont want to be a vampire killer either whatever possessed them to not include a fail mission button i understand critical mission timelines etc what i dont understand why i have to find 10 bear pelts for temba widearms  who i have no interest in  just to clear it off the list even a choice to decline a mission after i get told what it is would have been better than this ugghhhh  saving naming dammit i love ysolda and i wanna kill ysolda save games would have been a great inclusion  my final gripe the opening scene oh come on esc out of movie please everytime but hey look this is going to keep my occupied for a longlong time if all other rpgs out there are even close to the depth of this work of art despite her many faults im glad i converted genres i swear allegience despite trial and adversity to herald rpg from this day forth so help me mara 910 gg

the elder scrolls v skyrim its just one of those gems in gaming where as soon as when you get into it you may lose the way out i originally played skyrim and its official expansions on the ps3 version on their release days and i havent played a game that good in a long time time spent was nothing impressive for elder scrolls standards though mind you its just roughly 400 hours or so on the main save playing as a khajiit with a warriorassasin build & playstyle sword > shield later 2 words and from a bow i went to a dwarven crossbow dlc wep what makes this game so much fun is that its easy to learn for users both new and not so new how to play it you start of with whatever weapons and armor you can scavenge steal craft or be gifted and one step at a time as time flies by you discover and learn new ways to improve your skills and armor all you have to do is pick up any weapon you like and use it in combat tired of that same sword purchase a bow bow too boring craft a hammer the options really nearly endless skyrim is also one of those games that is not only about fighting and exploring either you can buy your own house you can get married and live a happy life together or alone handy to know for some of you out there is that this game allows players the choice to start same sex relations i know its been a debate and a gaming media thing so for that exact reason im just gonna throw it outta there it in hopes it might be useful for anyone who find this important but back to the home thing in the hearthome expansion pack 500 $500 steam store the home and marriage feature gets a nice big upgrade which gives you the ability to get a plot of land at 3 set locations and build your own house from scratch starting with a small simple cottage to perhaps a huge manion complete with kitchens bedrooms armories and livestock which you can decorate as you see fit if you meet the criteria it also allows you to adopt up to 2 children to raise as your own and adopt a pet note please adopt meeko again the possibilities are nearly endless for those who like to turn a page or two and read something in their own time about the history of skyrim or simple daily things like spear polishing and putting bread in the oven the elder scrolls v skyrim has more than 1000 pages of lore spread through all of skyrim covering many topics such as history myth monsters races religion art and more these books are found in caves homes stores and pretty much anywhere people have been be on the lookout some of them are actually pretty fun to read to sum things up skryim is a masterpiece any player can easily lose the time on pure from the many features and near perfect constructed world be warned all the best sie

before i start this review i need to clarify some things i know it doesnt look like ive played this game much but i have played skyrim on consoles since its launch in 2011 and have logged over 300 hours on both the xbox 360 and ps3 now on to the review i have been wanting this game on pc ever since i had first built my gaming pc i loved skyrim on the consoles and i consider it the best rpg of the decade so far part of me wanted it on pc for the mods the other part for the benchmarking purposes now that i own the game i can see i was completely wrong i have not in fact been getting the proper skyrim experience all these years just a crappy console port i had no idea how bad the graphics and loading times if you have never played it on console the loading times can take minutes can hinder immersion let me be the first to tell you when i first played this game on console even i was awestruck by the beauty the game had to offer the world is great and although i prefer oblivions world to this i still like this place it is so majestic when i got the game on pc and booted it up on max settings with the color mod i was awestruck all over again the fast loading times blew me away and the color mod showed how bland and disgusting the vanilla games color pallete is the game on max settings or even low console skyrim is at a setting below low is great looking not to mention the game in 60fps vs the 25 or so fps on console is absolutely breathtaking it really makes a difference and i am playing with a controller i would warrant a purchase of this game for all the reasons above including the excellent mods of this game to anyone who already owns the game on console now to the newcomers the game is an rpg and a big one it has a huge open world and basically drops you outside a cave and says here have a quest but you can go kill a chicken if you want did i mention there are huge dungeons to explore weapons to find and people to meetkill and the feeling is awesome it is basically a dowhateveryouwantwheneveryouwant kind of thing the npcs in the game are believeable and i sometimes didnt want to go on huge killing rampages massacaring whole towns like i did in oblivion or morrowind provided the combat system worked xd the detail in the game is immense and you can tell the devs took their time with this game honestly i feel kind of wierd right now i am here reviewing a game so big its mindblowing and i cant think of anything to say about it i dont want to ruin the experience for you it is too good do i recommend this game yes i couldnt possibly recommend it enough the game is so good i am skipping out on christmas eve movie night with my family to write this review i think its time for me to join them so i will leave you with a quote from the worlds wisest person thou shall not have lived if ye havent played skyrim

ah skyrim back in 2011 this was the game that everyone was talking about or something like that truly a great game decent character customization great graphics and scenery varied gameplay be a magewarriorassassin or be a jackofalltraits the rpg mechanics are good but it has a kind of short main questline but it has tons of side quests to help fill the time there are hundreds if not thousands of mods that you can get in the workshop or skyrimnexusmodscom which can enhance the experience further there are some flaws such as lack of tutorials on smithing and enchantment but that just makes it better in my opinion we all know how handholdy mmsmodern military shooters can be now days overall 910

my review for the elder scrolls v skyrim  various races with their different abilities you can even become a cat or a lizard too you can be a boy or a gurl and im not prof oak  a lot of quests really guys maybe i can finish most of unrepeatable quests but by the time ive done that i probably spent more than 1000 hours  the map is vast a lot of point of interest and by the time you unlock every one of them your maps gonna be full and heavier duh  travel skyrim as the mighty dragonborn a warrior who can master every kind of weapons and magic and also have a dragon blood running through your veins which is nice oh and you can also shout with the dragon language so you can curse people without them understand it because two things one they literally dont understand what youre saying two theyre probably dead cuz dragon language rulez fus ro dah  even though you are destined to be the mighty dragonborn you can and you should seek parttime job you can be a blacksmith potion or poison brewer equipment enchanter whatever that is  you can join a group of mercenaries magic nerds bunch of kleptomaniacs or fraternity of murderer oh you can also become vampires or against them blade will be proud and have your own castle you have to share with your fellow hobos though  oh and you can marry too good for you forever alone  you can drag dead bodies whenever you want throw junk whenever you want and the guard still ignoring you  this game is moddable original is great with mods no question asked 910

many people will say that skyrim is a perfect game lots of people will say that the dedicated modding community perfected an imperfect game unfortunately the problem that i have with skyrim cannot be modified without completely changing the entire game itself despite having a massive open world thousands of quests to complete and countless npcs with whom to interact i cant help but think that skyrim is a linear game you dont really get many real choices you can choose to join the factions guilds or brotherhoods but if you choose not to you wont complete the game you can choose what skills to level but you wont be able to use the perks you want without leveling everything however its your choice to not complete the game you can choose who to kill and who to spare but in the end killing always yields the greatest rewards the people you want to kill cannot be killed and the people you want to spare will die eventually instead of being a chooseyourown adventure book with several different outcomes that can be reached through many different paths skyrim is a hefty tome that gets better and better as you read but will end the same way for everyone once they stop reading the readers only real choice is when to stop reading that being said read on seriously there is so much more to read
