there are some good things about fm 2015 which might make it interesting for someone who has never played the series before for me as a pretty hardcore player i feel like im in a vicious circle just feeding my malcontent about the game but cannot break my addiction and hell ive had many spells of fm addiction throughout the last fifteen years but they are only truly rewarding when i feel i can make a difference with my particular style of play and my preferred scenario is the lower league model excessive scouting wheeler dealer kind of approach which is worth very little in 2015 the thing that works the least for me is that i dont feel i can truly play the game the way i would want to play it my expectation is that somehow getting a few amazing players in a league 2 or conference team should show but whether it shows or not depends on chance player ratings are very position dependent with central midfielders taking the runt of bad ratings however amazing they may seem so i might spend hours searching for the coolest prospects i can find fishing for work permits for my noneu conquests but getting phenomenal players on a mediocre squad matters very little the general feeling is of a wooden game bizarre things happen which seem to defy reason some are buggy like goalkeeper reactions some are fixable via lengthy tactical tinkering like defending corners and others are the worst of all monotonous long distance goals maybe on tv a fast player outrunning a defender unless the latter fumbles it keep dreaming half competent goalkeepers seem harder to find than the proverbial needle and then theres an aggressive randomness to how a team behaves and matches unfold my concede within the first ten minutes syndrome seems unshakable i am not saying it cannot be done but the feeling is that it is something that needs to be fixed from the get go rather than something that should be reasonably fine under normal conditions like corners and when theres a huge quality gap between your players and the opposition it all gets hard to fathom so why have i played hundreds of hours of this on the one hand the addiction on the other that elusive feeling when things actually do go right and you win an amzing match but i am left frustrated because fm seems to be going nowhere the development of the game fails to address key issues year after year a balanced match engine a bit of flair and a bit of the unexpected some character and individuality to the players unbiased ratings consistency and logic in the transfer system of course its not easy and theres a lot of back and forth in trying to get it all together but considering the heritage of this series i cannot avoid a distinct sensation of complacency padded with the occasional ui revamp or a couple of shiny new features bottom line if you have not played this yet maybe wait it out some more like until si decide to take the bull by the horns and create another classic there are many people who enjoy working on this game and its database is a treasure trove an inimitable advantage for anyone interested in joining the fray the risk with taking it up is that even if you get it for free time costs incurred are not worth the experience and chances are your passion for football will be your downfall in spite of this

ive been a huge fan of fm going way back before the big split that led to championship manager and football manager since i started this game ive won the league once and the treble in another season im in my fourth season so its not like im whinging because i cant win but there is clearly something wrong with the matchday engine the most succinct way i can put it is that its like theyve decided brazil vs germany from the last wc is commonplace ill keep 8 straight clean sheets or something like that then get beaten by a promoted side 60 or 75 whats more ive noticed other games in the league finishing 86 and stuff like that since i started counting in three seasons ive seen goalkeepers chipped from the touchline or from inside the defending half 27 times the game needs a lot of work its a winning franchise so all they need to do is fix it but dont spend your money on it until they do they have released a very dodgy product ive never seen an fm release like it just makes the game seem ridiculous even when youre winning and thats not why people play this game right

finally i am starting to fall out of love with this game just too many issues and it appears im not the only one to mention in one review so i will list my biggest bugbears  injuries  like many others each save game has been dominated with injuries fm liverpool fmc liverpool fm custom of course many players get injured but i have rarely managed to field an entire matchday squad without bringing in 23 reserve and youth players this means on average i have about 8 senior players injured 68 weeks is the most common length  training  there just seems to be no improvement on this side of things it is embarrassing that you can only train your whole team as one for example  attacking training there is not one professional team that have all their players do the same group training schemes why would i want the likes of skrtel toure and sakho doing attacking training the majority of the time it is just lazy game designing on top of this there appears to be a bug that a few players in your team are always upset about the high training workload  no matter what you try to fix it  talking to players  again it feels like this is a bit on the weak side you only have the same options available sure you can try to convince players but only with intangible promises  eg promise to bring in high profile players but with no obvious way to figure out if the player you buy is going to appease the player  everything is short term  this is my plan for this season  most clubs have a 3 or 5 year plan you should be able to lay out your plans for your contract entirety  eg have more money in the first year to build a squad that will develop or lay away your transfer kitty for later seasons because the squad you have now will get you promoted etc  teams still wont bid for new players or contract signees  it is very frustrating to buy a kid for the future and have to wait 6 months to loan him out tactics are inflexible  rarely does it work if you want to play a fast short game or a slow direct game this is nothing like real life remember liverpool last season or stoke every season plus they still havent brought back player runs  a huge miss for tactical control the biggest problem matchday  i watch it on 2d to try and avoid some of the bugs but a lot of them still persist the two most common are players not chasing down a loose ball 5 yards away from them and the worst one of allopponent takes a shot kepper makes a save ball comes back into the penalty box keeper watches it for 5 minutes whilst the opponent runs 25 yards to stick it in the back of the netfunny thing is it only happens to your keeper plus the tactics you use dont have a big effect on the game i tested this out by doing the old saverestart cheat against west brom at home tried 442451433 with different player combinations and tacticseach time lost 21 or 20 on the plus side it looks prettier unfortunately as most people point out there is no motivation for miles and the si team to make real improvements each year we will shell out 30 and receive some old rope in return at least now you can play the beta access and get bored of the game before its official release date if you would like to play alternative manager games i recommend fm11 and premier manager 97 those games felt like the developers cared

oh boy where to start the pros the game is so indepth detailed and looks great that at first glance you feel like you are in heaven unfortunately the absolutely ridiculous ai and randomness of the game ruins it for brand new players and seasoned veterans alike very quickly i have played football manager games since the 1990s i have bought every game in this football manager series i have probably tens of thousands of hours of experience playing these and have thoroughly enjoyed every fm yet until this fiasco i have only played this one with two teams man united and sheffield united but the experience has been identical the game is so damn unrealistic that it will suck the life out of you these are actual situations that happened in my season with man united a month into the season i have lost nearly third of my team to long injuries some players cannot put together two games in a row before returning to the injury list not totally out of the question but highly unlikely queens park rangers finished 2nd in the epl in my first season while tottenham and liverpool barely missed relegation i finished 9th and got fired i kept beating the top teams repeatedly while collapsing at home 05 to teams like qpr and swansea i lost 50 to a 9man manchester city after winning the shots 145 and hitting the postcrossbar five times frustrating but not impossible but scenarios like this unfold throughout the season the likes of rooney and mata cannot score regardless of opposition or their position on the field while james wilson bangs out a 30goal campaign you can literally have a guy of van persies stature standing on the 6yd line with an empty net and hit the post over and over again and dont even get me started on these phantom goalies you can be playing against a backup to the backup goalie 2 divisions below yours and fail to score while the opposition sinks 3 behind de gea on three shots i scored 2 or 3 goals from direct free kicks all season and maybe twice from a corner my opponents you got it somewhere around dozens now it might sound like im making excuses and dont know how to manage but as i said i have enjoyed these types of games some 20 years whether i win or lose why because the games have been as fair and realistic as a simulations sports game can be sure there will always be that crazy 75 home win against some world class team but when it happens once every 150 games or so thats pretty okay there will always be that game where an underdog takes you down and leaves you extremely frustrated but guess what it actually happens what doesnt happen are the scenarios i discussed above and after some 150 hours into fm 2015 i feel like i have enough personal experience to call this game total garbage fortunately fm 2013 and fm 2014 are still installed on my computer and still offer limitless hours of fun and entertainment do not waste your money on this game play the older installations and wait until sports interactive gets their crap straight a major major disappointment

pros love the new layout and skin communication with players is better than ever love the new options in transfer and contract negotiations cons way too easy to sign top players and the 48 month payment options are pretty broken they should take more out of your budget for them since at the moment you can spend 100m on a 25m budget match engine is terrible best way to win is by playing like big sam hoof it up to the wingers and have a big man in the middle keepers are also terrible constantly fumbling into the path of oncoming strikers getting caught in posession and passing to the opponent defenders cant mark in the box and miss free headers constantly i would say 34 of all goals come from a cross or a keeper  defender doing something shambolic overall great new features coming at the expense of all the simple things if they fix the match engine then this could be a very good installment currently 410 if patched 910

do not waste your money i spent 35 quid on this game and its the worst one in the entire franchise maybe its just your tactics is coming from most of your lips now wrong unless you are one of the top clubs in the world you will find things such as limited tackling never when its needed ai always get every second ball terrible players can run faster than usain bolt every game has the opposition score a world class goal against you from 40 yards impossible to stop combined with the no tackling your players kicking the ball out whilst trying to pass gks animations forcing them to fail to attempt to save goals rblbs are useless might as well have 9 players the ai is insane always making perfect tackles interceptions from across the pitch because your players try to walk to the ball 90th min goals 5foot 6 players out jumping a 65ft player none existant marking throw in  pass  goal always with the ai no long throw tactic defence every long ball will go to the ai team simple catches have gks in fits gks rushing out and flapping gks code has them try to catch balls on their flight paths only for the ball to go to the first man and they have an empty net players walking through other players without taking the ball no marking from passes 5 defenders in the box one opposition striker he gets the ball and vollys it across goal players on the post wander off as soon as a cornerfreekick is taken players walk away from their markers when the ball is active strikers usually yours 910 times in an offside position insert name didnt mean that goals are happening nearly every game touchline team talk has no effect to anything players do not listen to the tactics shooting less results in a cm player taking the same amount of shots as with it off the graphics are pretty poor ai will kick balls through your players bodies no pressure hoof balls up the field injuries every game leaking goals faster than the titanic leaked water all of the above has come from about an hours worth of play the engine is ablitorated all logic and reason goes out of the window maybe some of the above might relate to my tactics but a huge % are serious flaws within the game

lets be straight forward scroll to the bottom for indept review this year the boys have really taken the game to the next level the game has fixed many issues in the past and almost faultless compared to the past 2014 & 2013 versions things that i really enjoyed  the new interface is very nice but does take time to get used to  match engine y fantastic compared to the past though minor issues with ball bounces lack of roll  the new function to choose the type of manager you are gives the game a more indept feel  frankly the new functions gives you a lot more abilities in managing and structuring your team  tunnel interviews though i personally hate press conferences im lazy the tunnel interviews are a very nice touch things that bug me a bit about the game  the match engines ball bounce is a bit static and does not flow  players opinions seem a lot stronger might just be because i am a new manager  the new interface takes awhile to get used to im still getting my head around it overall my review visuals 810 game engine 7510 gameplay 910 game interface and user friendliness 710 verdict 810 definately recommended ___________ football manager 2015 is the next lineup from its previous stage 2014 equiped with an massive overhaul of the games features and interface this years product was definately highly anticipated so here is my review of the game interface frankly it is definately a fresher look to the game the new interface allows for players to have greater ease and control in getting to different areasdepartments that they need to quickly eg boardroom or squads the overhauled interface tries to bring back memories of the older versions of fm with a updated twist and many users may have a hard time readjusting backto the new interface personally i feel the new interface is a nice idea however does make things a bit complicated in situations but i believe it is simply down to it being new give it a couple daysweeks and you should be comfortable with it verdict 710 game engine with sega taking the game engine to a new level this year this was simply one of the most awaited feature of this years game and guess what it didnt dissapoint with visuals now smoother and insync with the game it is visually astounding when compared to 2014 slicker moves and more cohesion in game less ping pong of 2014 it certaintly is a big upgrade however my criticism would be the ball physics as the bounce does give it a edgy feel with unrealistic and rather static bounce features no matter the angle of the kick verdict 7510 fm2014 was a 5510 gameplay frankly the new features have possible added difficulty to the game which is definately a plus point especially since many users grow tiredbored of the ease of winning in fm 2014 though made slightly tougher it is an interesting addition with new manager formats to choose from finances and training did get a wanted boost and are you as a manager has more opportunities to manipulate work with them to your advantage the gameplay is definately a joy to behold verdict 910 overall look no game can be perfect yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine but for a simulator such as this fm is frankly amazing overall i have to say that football manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all football fanatics if you are a past fm player and have been dissapointed with past versions i honestly beg you to revisit your perspective and try out fm15 please it is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money final verdict 810 [b] hope this helps in making your decision

football manager is not a game until you have loaded football manager up you will not have discovered the wonders that lay inside you start about 900am in the morning you think ill just play a few hours then go get something to eat before you know it the years 2022 and your new youth prospect david moores has scored a hattrick against manchester united real madrid are bidding 40000000 for him but the lads been with you since he was 16 you discovered him in the depths of the crewe academy and you dont want to let him go but the brat wants a new challenge hes telling you that if he doesnt go hes going to start making the dressing room negative then it happens you wake up you realise that it was just a dream david is happy to stay at the club football manager is not a game its a part of your life

ive played fm for many years now and i didnt get into fm 14 due to its issues that had at first and now this also has some issues i did two seasons with fiorentina and scored 100 odd goals the first season and came 2nd the problem is no defence like we conceded 6869 goals and its not tactic related like others have said the teams you play against always wondergoals you cant do anything about and also i duno if its just me but i get a crazy amount of offsides like at least in 10  games both teams 12 offsides also other noteable problems are injuries at least it was realistic at this point when i took charge of arsenal literally in 4 days like 6 injuries to key players some big ones untill patches are out i wouldnt recommend this

time for yet another fm and instead of the usual praise to the sky i find myself struggling for words i played as fc copenhagen within a month i had 8 firstkey team members out with injuries  and not just the common cold mind you  no oh no one with a broken ankel two with damaged tendrons a broken foot etc the shortest injury was 3 months  i feel like im running a community hospital rather than a football club anyways we recover and start winning some matches  except we dont for some odd reason it seems like you can dominate a match to the point where even the opponents fans are rooting for you and yet they still pull a comeback at the end draws galore 1 shot 1 kill so to speak but heck lets review some of the positives as well great realistic scouting system good layout aaaaand yup id recommend you wait purchasing this game until another update has come out do it for you own sake and for ours  the unfortunate souls that purchased this game in good faith that it would be the high standard the game usually is let them feel the heat so they can fix this asap

well this is it the last fm game ill ever buy for full price its not a bad game on its own but charging aaa price for this yearly database update and on top of that shamelessly charging 45 euros for the ingame editor is the last straw for me at least give the preorder buyers a 40% discount and a free ingame editor because your yearly rehash is highly overpriced right now sisega honestly i dont know what i was expecting out of this years game it has been exactly the same for what 56 years now and thats only if you count the annoying interviews and the 3d engine take those away and its the same exact game i played 12 years ago that would not necessarily be a bad thing if they didnt ask for so much money the things the game gets wrong as si would put it include but are not limited to the economy is screwed up still the poor low reputation clubs still ask that you pay more than the players market value yet they set your club with their real world budget and debts they really dont give a damn its all about rich clubs and england as usual because the premier league is the only important one out of 100 leagues 100% of people play in the premier league right the 3d match engine still looks and acts janky as all hell defenders will just stand next to the loose ball while the opposition striker is charging in at full speed the amount of goals scored is currently too high to be remotely realistic i never had a game without scoring only 3 without conceding i beat one team 103 played 15 competitive matches scored 51 and conceded 24 goals so 75 goals in 15 matches if i count the 4 friendlies it gets even more ridiculous the game still has the cheating match engine you lose to a weaker team you know it was set up so you reload the game to test it you lose again maybe 10 reloads later you get a draw but you wont win until you give up the 3d engine and switch to text mode or til you thats right folks until you buy the ingame editor and fix the game   call me a noob and ill just delete your comment and assassinate you when you arent looking ive been playing the game for 12 years and i know my tactics and training setups wouldnt be fair if i didnt say anything positive about this years changes would it now  i like the new interface as for the recommendation if you own the last years game or 2013 2012 2004 dont buy this game the semi updated 3d engine has nothing good to offer and the rest of the game is totally the same the database update is not worth the money until the game goes 75% off if you dont own any fm games but would like to buy one get it at 50% off if youre like me and preordered it go to the steam store and look at games you could have bought instead and cry or keep playing this theyre bound to patch the stupid out of it at some point right right finally here are my scores for the game full price score  510  absolutely not worth 50 of any world famous currency except rubles maybe 50% off  710  if youre shaking and fifa 15 doesnt help you might want to give fm 15 a shot 75% off  810  get it and enjoy it by the time it goes down to 75% off the patches should soften the rough edges youll be getting the best version of this years game at a reasonable price

the match engine is very unrealistic i believe that i stand for most fm players when i say that the best attraction for this game is the tactical ingenuity that we the players can display that wins matches and title yet the tactical changes we make is not reflected during the actual matches the man managing aspect of the game is also overly complicated managers now also have basis stats for our tactican attributes which does not make any sense the biggest problem nonetheless is the tactical and match engine the tactical gameplans are not reflected on the pitch and neither are the attributes of the players the poor match engine results in goal galores that are just too unrealistic

playing fm since 20002001 the series is my favourite of all time across all genres the last 3 years however the game has been getting gradually more of an exercise in ambigious tedium than the magical gaming experience it used to be i appreciate the people at si need to change the game to justify the price tag i just dont know why they insist on breaking the game to do so i can only hope the truly awful new features im looking at you tactics screen will be patched they wont though way too much pride god what ive give for the return of slide bars id also love some explanation no matter how vague for how the 10 million different variables that can affect the outcome of a match actually work im certain si changed the way things like tempo work in game for different tactics without mentioning it or eve updating the tips bar poor form moreover having touchline shouts pressers player interaction 3 teamtalks its too much and its for the most part very very boring as for the me just like with fm14 and 13 at release its broken you would think after 2 poor mes at release si would have the integrity and self respect to deliver this year i remember when si used to release games that didnt need a single patch i think the monopoly si have over the genre has made them complacent its only natural i suppose do not purchase until they have fixed the game maybe in mid march 2 months before the season ends d

after 250 hours of game play its time for a review of fm15 ive been playing these games for a long time since cm9697 since you asked and honestly i think this one is the best yet there were some early problems with the match engine and the inverted wing back role is still broken he stays wide like a normal wing back but the vast majority of the most glaring issues high scoring games regular goalkeeping errors etc have been fixed in sis patches and in good time as well i thought the motion capture animations in the match engine would be a bit of a gimmick but that has turned out to be a welcome addition to the game on an aesthetic level its by no means hyperrealistic to the point where youd be unsure whether youre watching a match on tv or in fm but its a big step up from the hand drawn players of fm14 the realism or lack of isnt a deal breaker for me all i want to see is a realistic simulation of a football match and in fm15 thats what we have for the most part if you watch the matches on comprehensive highlights or higher then you can easily see your tactical decisions playing out in front of you as the game ebbs and flows and for that if nothing else fm15 is the best edition of the football manager series so far setting up a tactic is fairly simple although not fool proof but like any simulation its easy to get in to and difficult to master one thing i have noticed though having spent a lot of time talking to other players and reading some of the reviews here on steam is that this is not a game for players who want to just pick a match day squad and have a handsoff approach to management you will succeed at fm if you make sensible tactical choices always be mindful of balance in your rolesduties and dont use the same approach for every match you play every match will play out differently the most common complaints ive seen from others are regarding injuries and dominating the game yet losing in the dying moments of the match for injuries i dont have these problems as i make sure my players are fully fit use preseason wisely allow your players to ease into it after coming back from holiday then train hard and play lots of friendlies once the season begins lower the intensity of training and give them all individual set ups it takes a while but if you do this your players will be much less prone to injury and will develop faster as well there will be injuries of course but i dont have anywhere near the issues others are having and most of my injury problems are ingame due to my aggressive high pressing style on the domination side of things i will say that more shots and possession does not mean dominance choose your battles wisely if youre the bigger team you can expect your opponent to sit back and hit you on the counter counter this yourself by playing patiently and forcing mistakes your creative players will take care of the rest im not an fm expert but if you take these simple words of advice then you will see for yourself how quickly things will turn around for your team the only thing i cant comment on yet is the ais squad development in the long term as i havent gone far enough into the game yet in past fms this has been a problem but i can already see less instances of the ai spending millions on a player only to let him rot in their reserve team as si say themselves itll never be perfect itll never be finished so as long as you go into the game with that mindset youll get the most out of it i highly rcommend this game for anyone who watches football analytically or who thinks they could do a better job than their favourite teams manager

ive been playing football manager since 2005 this is without a doubt the most frustrating and unrealistic installment purely because of a buggy game simulation sit and watch the 3d matches being played and youll be impressed at some nice new animations but the game being played infront of you will make you want to put your fist through your monitor  strikers miss 90% of 1 on 1 chances  chances that should result in a goal often dont and come around far too often than in real life  defenders that wander all over the place and dont tackle  wingers that seem content to run into defenders rather than crosspass the ball even if a teammate is in tons of space that just names a few needs a patch a big one

waste of time and money fundamentally they have done minor tweaks to minor components of the game and changed the interface but absolutely botched the matchday engine which makes the game almost unplayable despite implementing succesful tactics and qaulity players in defence conceeding from crosses 23 times a game is a regular occurence and seems to be the only means of scoring goals for the opposition and your own team in addition to this injuries occur on average about 12 times a game and it seems that a full strength starting 11 will always be unacheivable because half the squad is injured it is extremely frustrating and unstoppable i bought fm15 for an improvement of fm14 but what i got was a different interface and a circuss of a matchday engine where goals go in at an unrealistic rate and players are playing with bones made out of toothpicks breaking every time they pass a ball stick to 14 as i will really below average effort i hope to see an improvement with a later patch

why does everyone cost so much even kids i found a 17 year old bjorn marinovnever good enough for my team barely good enough for most teams got fed up getting stupid offers back from good clubs for good players so chanced him out of curiosity and here is what i got stats not the worst but hardly great https28postimgorgda7xs1zr1marinovpng clubs valuation utterly stupid https28postimgorgaheq80zelmarinov_negpng and this is every time every player i know the footballing world has inflated valuations for players and fm takes that in to account but for the love of jebus some common sense would be nice also would be nice to buy a game that works and is playable from day 1 the day you buy it rather that having to wait till near jebus bday before its playable heres an ideafar out there but worth a try find someone or more than one in the office that plays the damn game get them to try it out before you have the audacity to charge people for it so that when you do charge for beta its only minor fixes then when you sell the full game it ing works remember when you could hand over your money and in return get a fully working enjoyable game i remember regardless i will never buy this game again stupidly thought this year would be better like i did last year and the year beforebasically same  every yearrant over

dont get me wrong i love football manager the layout is great and everything runs smoother than previous iterations that is great as i always felt it was a minor problem however why in seven hells is every decent youth player worth from 200k to around 2 million but when you try to purchase them for maybe 3 million 4 million the club asks for something ridiculous upwards of 25 million seriously the best i can do is constantly buy old players who wont be ridiculously over priced timo werner for example i can buy lionel messi for just under his jaw dropping price tag of 62 million lets be realistic here abromovich would be laughing if mourinho wanted that player and was asking him for that amount of money seriously this is meant to be the most realistic football management simulation sort it out please oh and just as a final note i really dont find it realistic if 7 of my first team get injured in a single match for 5 months each does anyone know when the next update is

this has to be this worst fm for a long time i cant seem to get into it like the others and match engine doesnt seem as good ive no idea why the devs felt the need to change the match engine again because they changed it in fm 14 and that was bugged on release as well but alot better than in this version when players are running with the ball its as though they are running in thick mud cos they are so slow goalkeepers are broken they cant seem to save anything the ui is bad as well no idea why they felt the need to change it selecting your team line up now requires more clicks and takes longer cos of the changes i really hope the devs fix the issues but overall this game is a disappointment over previous fm games

do not buy this game check my games list you will see that i once loved fm games not anymore and never again will i buy one this is the type of unfinished game that steam need to ban from being sold certain key components dont even work at all a small example is that there are no penalties from handballs right now the game fails in every way it could the me is a poor imitation of a crossing and set pieces simulator not a football simulator it is worse than the last three years versions upon release and i can assure you that they all had bugs and issues not this many or this bad if you really need more just go to the forums and read not many that will claim this game is anywhere near in a playable state maybe in 78 months from the time i write this si will have released a patch that makes it something like a game oh if that wasnt enough beware si and sega are not cooperating and are in fact sending customers with issues back and forth between them not me but check forum if you care also be aware that si are deleting the vast majority of negative posts claiming it will affect the way our customers play the game which is of course true they wouldnt play it because they would know whats wrong with it

i wouldnt recommend buying this game until a few patches are released the release version is full of bugs especially the match engine that makes it almost unplayable i mean sure you can play it but you just have to cringe at all the goals scored from obvious match engine bugs at this point 50% of goals are scored from crosses on the wing that your defenders just dont contest 30% scored from set pieces 10% scored on missplaced backpasses to the keeper and 10% for the rest the defense and goalie are so terrible most matches end with 4 goals scored if you want to win just make sure you have wingers who like to hug the touchline and cross the ball instead of cutting inside should have expected it really it is the first time i buy fm right on the release date

its decent installment again but nothing much is new i paid 35 bucks for this and just upgraded from the beta to the full game and i dont notice a single difference everything still is as shady as in the beta  this just wont stand it means theyve probably had this game ready for ages since the changes are just graphical mostly and want to hussle us as much as they can of course the engine  card  injury system is messed up on launch as usual too ffs why do i keep falling for their scummy tricks i cant recommend anyone buying this now get it for 1520 bucks and after a few patches and maybe then its a decent update had to choose thumbsdown until the state of the game changes then my review might change too edit just got a crash dump error for the second time as well im done with this till they patch it back to fm14 it is sigh  edit 2 the only thing fixed are the crash dumps i no longer get crashes but the match engine is still so random and terrible that i dont even want to play no more edit 3 20122014 almost winter and this game is still a mess you can lose to the number 18 of the league with your best eleven and then 3 days later win against a stronger opponent with your bsquad for no reason at all si should be ashamed of themselves

im a fifa manager guy however as it has been discontinued i had to move to football manager a friend taught me the ropes and ive been playing for a while i played with liverpool ac milan bayer leverkusen and atltico madrid no game has gone to midseason i studied researched and spent a lot of time talking with friends about this game i wish i hadnt this is just the worst manager game ive ever played for a simple reason nothing you do matters i bought marco reus and alex oxdalechamberlain to play on the wings might as well have kept the money for myself and used emile heskey and djimi traor there the most skilled player cannot dribble past the worst defender the best crosser of the ball cannot beat the first man the tallest and best header cannot score 3 goals a season from crosses every team play the exact same way and most goals come from the same three things shots from outside the box defensive mistakes and freekicks in upwards of 300 hours spent in the game i dont think i saw a single goal from a corner however three times i saw a goalkeeper handle the ball outside the box and get booked and two of those freekicks resulted in goals players are so unbelievably stupid that its annoying steven gerrard to take a free kick on the edge of the box you think hes going for goal no hes going to pass it back to the left back who will then try to dribble and lose it you think asmir begovic is a good goalkeeper well hes not above handling the ball outside of the box when trying to boot it upfield id always been told that football manager was all about the tactics and that it is the hardest thing to manage well it is hard specially because no matter how you set your team up to play they will always play the same way you can try to get the best passers of the game but they will misplace at least 30% of their 6 yard passes this is so frustrating im at a loss for words injuries well hows this for a list before the third match of the season i had the following players injured steven gerrard jordan henderson alex oxdalechamberlain alberto moreno john flanagan marco reus adam lallana daniel sturridge asmir begovic and mario balotelli thats before the third match all of those players bar lallana and reus who are injured at the start of the season got injured during pre season seriously unless this game is heavily patched to fix everything thats not just wrong but plain dumb ill be forced to stop playing a genre i really enjoy because ea were not competent enough to keep fifa manager going and because sega apparently have no clue what a football match looks like ill wait and see but i will not hope for much

people often send me messages asking why i am playing this game so i thought i would post a review to explain why i will first point out that i have a strong interest in football i wouldnt say i watch the matches but i am always reading news stories online and am up to speed with the majority of world football headlines i will also say i am not a massive fan of the fifa series of games produced by ea they seem to have a very immature audience whenever i have tried to play them online and that is something which puts me of immediately football manager the series puts you in the office of a football manager shocker huh you take on all the jobs that a football manager does from setting up tactics to training sessions all the way to signing new players for your team personally i find myself getting very immersed in this game there is something really special about taking a team from one of the lower leagues all the way up to being the best team in the world once you pass the first couple of seasons the players which are around today all start to retire move onto different teams etc this is when the game really begins the game will create computer generated random players these are called regens how good these regens are depends on a number of things but mostly the training and youth facilities you have at your club there is nothing more satisfying in the this game than finding a young 17 year old unknown kid and training and developing him into a worldclass footballer people may laugh or snarf at this game but if you enjoy football and want to find yourself a massive addictive time sync then football manager is the game for you

instead of getting the core of the game right tactics match engine we get yet another load of new press interactions that nobody cares about and even more dumb talks with players and teams sure you can get your assistants to do it but some players actually likes talkes to press and staff as long as its not repetitive and actually has an impact nevertheless the real problem is with the match engine results like 3 to 5 or 4 to 4 are common the goalkeeper stays on his line for every cross and the movements the players make in the engine are laughable the crowd looks like a bunch of inflatable dolls in the stand and just like previous x versions there is hardly any atmosphere in terms of sound from the crowds where have the good old sack the boss chants gone or why cant the crowd whistle or boo at the ref for that crippled engine we get the amazing gift of hot dog stands outside the stadium wow thanks for getting your priorities straight si last time i bought the game since 9899 time for a decent competitor

thank god i only paid 5 for this prasie the lord for gifts cards when playing fm13 i thought that these games were head and shoulders above any other football game in terms of the imersiveness and the elevel of realism but the last two games since then have been truly discusting i dont care about the graphics thats not what the game is about but the actual realism of the match engine is poor what is going on with the goalkeepers this year about 1015 of my conceded goals have come directly from rebounds from frankly rediculous saves from the keep he will just parry the ball away from the most tame shot imaginable and stand there for about a year until the follow up from the opposition striker rolls it in then he dives injuries are something which many people are complaining about i dont feel like my tactical changes have any efect on the game match stats mean nothing this is a real shame because i have a lot of time for si but im losing faith by the day i feel like some things happen on the game just to make you more addicted becasue lets be honest its more addictive when your not winnimg because you cant put the game down until you have sorted it and why do you have a sudden drop in form ever jan or feb every team has a bad patch but i aloong with many other players have unexplained drops in form where nothing you do can halt the slide i could go on for hours but i cant be bothered to give anymore feed back because i dont think it makes any differenc so if this review does nothing more than let me take my anger out on it then so be it

this game is really atrociously bad tactics are stupid the players are stupid and what can you say about the matchengine is just action after reaction after reaction  ask your team to tackle a player hard  get sent off after 2 min  go 2 up  get 2 pegged back  then score 3 2  or go 2 down  peg 2 back  then lose 32  teamtalk press conferences  whats the point of it all seriously  i want my money back  the last good fm was also the first one  2005 10 years of garbage and its just keeps getting worse by every year  i will never buy fm again

like every previous football manager games i preordered fm15 just to play beta i have to say this year there are way more bugs then every other years i played 50 hours in the first 3 days of the release of the beta version and i spotted about 10 problems because this is my favourite game i just keep playing and identify bugs in the bugs forum so my favourite game can be fixed yet i waited after two updates the game is still not fixed bugs that are still not fixed  after stadium expansion plan got cancelled the finishing date still highlight on the calendar  rooney get unhappy because pre season training start too early even though it is nearly december  defenders with at least 15 pace and 15 acceleration chase down the ball that has passed the defenders line ridiculously slow this is the most frustrating bug how can phil jones or jonny evans or rafael chase down a ball so so so slow it is pretty much slower than others walking the opponent end up getting ball easily since the defenders cant even get the ball with 50 metres head start throughout the 3 seasons ive seen this occurred 20 times so im quitting until it is fixed  setpiece marking is completely broken i set pretty much all my players to defend 3 form wall and 7 markers against 5 opponent yet 3 out of 5 opponents are completely unmarked and freely roaming around on the side of my wall  team selection layout maybe a minor issue but it can be annoying if you have a big squad or you want to pick someone in the youth team there used to be a sub slots column next to starting formationline up now it it gone you now have to drag a player from the players list to the substitute slots on the same list picking substitute has never been harder in my life  budget adjustment in my first season at manutd i can adjust the transfer budget to zero so i can have 36 mil per week for wage budget the second season i adjust it all the way to wage budget but i can only get 3 mil per week wage budget so that means my minimum transfer budget is 60 mil im paying players 3 mil wage per week so whats the point of having maximum 3 mil for wage budget and 60 mil for transfer budget why cant i have all my transfer budget all my wage budget  there are many more i have posted all the bugs ive spotted on the bugs forum but all i get is pissy tone replies or thread closed for lacking evidence they expect me to download this thing so i can post the game file on the server for them and ive try installing it on my mac countless of time it failed to install not to mention it is sponsored by mackeeper a freaking mac virus i tried to posted screenshot on the forum it never works they recommended this other software which has 2 weeks trial for free do i have to pay to help them identify the bugs i tried upload so videos of the bugs so my thread doesnt get close down and i get all these pissy replies since there server doesnt work i upload the game file on a file hosting website they still expect me to upload it on a server that never works on my mac mostly unappreciated replies when im trying to help them occasionally i get a nice reply but i am very unhappy with the game i save up my pocket money to preorder it paypal converted the money to profit them i got charged by banks with overdrawn fee and i get a game full of rubbish

while i have loved the fm series since its inception this is the worst version i have played yes the menu system has been changed and will take a while to get used to ut just feels cluncky and the scouting system has changed drematically and has problems as i scouted ross barkley managing swansea and got back this player would not be a worth while signing the worst thing about this game is whatever decideds the score currently i am 15 games into the season and so far the best result for any team away is a draw burnley v chelsea 11 all the other matches have been home wins for the respected teams and some strange results qpr beating arsnel 63 my results away have been awful and at home frakley strange h v everton 52 w a v villa 40 l a v leicester 70 l h v man city 21 w h v man utd 10 w a v tot 42 l h v liverpool 30 w a v burnley 20 l a v chelsea 82 l a v west ham 60 l h v arsenal 31 w h v west brom 62 w a v southhampton 31 l h v qpr 40 w a v sunderland 10 l its stupid everyone is near enough on the same popints its coming down to goal difference this has nothing to do with tactics or team moral there is a major bug in the system

i love the game very much however there are always some concerns these are all game play issues 1 a few players ratings messi is 20 everything as usual but he didnt have a great last season like he usualy does some players are quite underrated such as di maria and a few atletico madrid players ronaldo has 15 acceleration not sure how that works 2 some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainablenot sure if its a bug or not sometimes the defenders just headspass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it 3 when players dribble they run into teamates far too often which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life 4 this is a very irritating one players misses 1v1s far too much if they have 45 1v1 chances theyll manage to score one this is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply dont miss all those chances you could say that they are having a bad game but its happening consistantly throughout the season also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance but our players just blast it strait at their keepers 5 final one so far players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target so far i havnt seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition please could you fix these issues i would be forever greatful

in every game 13 player gets injured this game kicks your nut sacks as long till you want to play a totally different game long winning streaks followed by long losing streaks even the league bottom dwellers hits you with 60 too many goals 45 on average horrible execution tackles inside penalty areas almost never leads to a penalty shot but penalties come from errors which you cannot even see fm15beta is faulty as hell good job si ok this is beta but it has to be a totally different game on next friday when the official release date is best goal  my goalie was called by referee goalie walked there and received an yellow card then my goalie started jogging towards his work place and meanwhile the opponent gave their corner kick and scored an empty netter rather play fm13 beyond earth and this prepurchased and regret both never again a prepurchase not even one

i want to play this game i like fantasy games but everytime i start it up i remember that half my team will be injured within the first 3 months that no matter what i do consistency is not possible and my team will fail to perform and i will fail to have any real impact on that despite the rediculas sometimes over lapping micromanaging aspects that are both too specific and too general example exploit the flanks doesnt mean exploit the flanks more it means only exploit the flanks unless you select other options in which that ratio cant be controlled example you can have multiple coaches for multiple traits and skills but can only have one practice type per day you can try to teach a player a new move or position and its up to the player if hes compatable let alone compitent you will train and trade and chances are players wont want to come to your club in which case the conversational options are minimal repetative and nonimpactful oh and did i mention that some of the user interface is completely bugged and i mean completely try organizing your custom view and watch as some of your options do not appear you want to sort by position sure wait then why does it sort by ability when i click position to suggest this game would be to encourage this type of lack luster game developing that is become the norm im not saying you cant make money but just publish a game every other year and charge us 100$ for something you can be proud of instead of dusting off and polishing the same game with improved data

i dont know what people are crying about i havent noticed any problems with the injuries and ive started several saves both in top and bottom tier football overall this is by far the best football manager thats released to date althought theres still a few bugs here and there like theres pretty much every year by the january update the game will most likely be pretty much a bug free which is when most people buy the game anyway the new match engine is very promising and i think its already better than in the previous versions the new touchline team talks also seems to be working pretty well and the add another dimension to the game the new scouting system is also superior compared to the previous versions and then the new ui its again way better than before and having the side panel back just makes its so much easier to navigate through the menus so overall i think its the best football manager game to date although it still have a few bugs here and there if you are a fan of the football manager franchise then this is definitely a must buy remember that the christmas sales are coming soon so its probably worth waiting till then if you havent got the game already by now and this was written by someone who spents 10001500 hours with football manager each year and i own each and every game of the serie including quite a few versions of cm too

is this worth your purchase yes is it worth your purchase if yopu have fm2014 no so bottom line you get your normal squad updates etc they has been a change of the screens but really you get the same information just presented in a slight diffrent way the 3d engine is the best improvment its fine to watch now but still not perfect so yes i like this game but kinda wished i had spent my money on something else as for me this is not a massive upgrade to last years this is just my thoughts and you might think diffrent its your choice

another version pretty much the same as the others but upgraded more animations and moreanimations more features as well apparently but well get to that soon i was excited for fm 2015 as i normally am whenever a new version comes out i start up a save where im unemployed with a sunday league reputation this time i have to think about the coaching badges as well i dont want any i will start at the very bottom then i experience some rpg attribute thingy am i a tracksuit manager or a tactical manager hell if i know i am both but according to the game i kind of have to choose one or the other i like the idea but i find it a bit too gimmicky loading up every single league the game comes with and a large database takes me about 15 minutes before i can start playing for real the game progresses smoothly no problems being over the recommended player limit yet im in the year 2025 now and still no problem granted it slows down a bit when changing months changing year and during transfer deadline days but i expected that playing the game itself is a bit like a tiny rollercoaster ride i love playing the game but there are so many tiny bugs and features that dont work very well sidebar i dont mind it but it gives me less room for customised screens while on the subject customised screens a complete mess i warned them about these kind of things on sis forums small tiny bugs like these might seems small but they will come back and be a bigger issue its been there for a long long time and they havent done anything about it it wasnt prioritised and now theyre struggling to figure out how to fix it go figure customising screens is a nightmare columns disappearing left and right when you have plenty of room on the screen you just want to adjust the width of one column a few mm poof an entire column or two gone very annoying as i customise most of my screens player interactions are just a complete mess and do not work properly an entire team in outrage because a 17year old who wouldnt get anywhere near the bench of my local 10thtier reallife club amazing nobody would care not even the 17year old himself players complaining that they want to play more games we are in the middle of the bleeding holidays we dont have another game for 3 months then comes back and wants to leave because i didnt keep my promise of playing him were still one and a half month away from our first friendly then when i try to sell him he complains that im trying to force him out of the club wellkind of yeah you wanted to leave becuase of playing time and me not keeping promises so now you want to leave because i was trying to let you leave because you wanted to player interactions is a big mess one big negative from me is tactics screen lord oh lord what have they done fm14 had the closetoperfect tactics screen and then they change it for no apparent reason change it to something a thousand times worse now to be fair they have updated the tactics screen with their patches so it looks a bit better to a new player i dont know what to say i personally dont like the tactics screen at all i simply dont use it backroom advice my coaches are still offering me contradicting advice why the hell would i want my left fullback dribble on the right hand side when you just told me to train him so he doesnt do that anymore i could write a whole lot more about the ups and downs with this game but ill just do this i do enjoy the game quite a bit but its not the best fm far away from it another notcomplete version of this game which i am getting a bit tired of it seems like its acceptable that this is always a game in progress it will always be in progress and i understand that but each released version should feel like a complete product it doesnt and it hasnt done that for a long time people on the forums wants features and more features on one hand they get applauded for doing so but when things arent working so well they get the defenders shouting theyre just a small company if theyre not so big then stop adding so many features stop adding more than they can handle which seems to be the case more and more each year more features doesnt equal better product it also needs to work properly which it doesnt this seems like an overly negative review and it kind of is but i have to say that i do enjoy this iteration as well ill still have probably over a thousand hours in this game when fm16 comes out having a lot of fun finding it harder personally than any other version but i love the challenge i do recommend this game make no mistake about that ill leave this review with the things that bothers me the most about this fm2015 cons  player interactions doesnt work properly  tactics screen x 1000 its just many steps back from what they had  issue with getting players match fit in lower leagues  too easy overacheiving when you have the right tactic compared to real life  scouting is very tedious and doesnt work properly  customising screens doesnt really work

great addition to the series despite a lot of negativity towards it the new interface is great and improves on last years version i do agree to an extent that injuries do get a bit ridiculous towards parts of the season  my most memorable being managing wolfsburg and having 7 regular starters injured all within a space of 23 months aside from this everything else has been great tactics have been spot on i also tested a few tactics from the workshop and i was surprised at how good some of them were  but it didnt make an instant difference some tactics took a good 510 games to start flowing nicely otherwise i would find myself conceding at least 2 goals per game this year i was focusing solely on gaining most of the achievements rather then spending my life going through season to season with my favourite team ive been an admirer of these games since championship manager 98 and think ive purchased it every year from then it is true that a lot of the updates could quite easily come into a nice dlc bundle or same game upgrade however this is not the case people should note that they are not forced to buy the game every year their are plenty of dedicated people within the football manager community that focus on updating the databases for older game titles in order for those to keep playing the old game with the new data overall i have loved fm15 and am pleased to say that after all these years sports interactive are still making good progress in providing a richer and more fulfilling football manager

it is a new game with a new and very easy to use interface imo together with the gameplay fm15 looks amazing on the outside i know this is just a beta and i have only played a few hours on this game i have encountered problems which i dont know whether i am terrible at managing arsenal or that the bugs are really messing me up 1 lots and lots of own goals it happened that calum chambers scored a hatrick of own goals against qpr which ultimately lost me the game 2 injuries injuries everywhere at least all my players have been injured once since i have been in charge 4months and it is getting ridiculous debuchy was injured for 3 months then i played him once he got fit and got injured again for another 2 it is getting out of hand 3 goalkeepers where do i begin goalkeepers do the craziest  in the entire world sometimes it can be funny and other times its frustrating as fwuak it is also not my own gk aswell when i check other games replay the goalies can be proper sorry other than those issues this game has been great for me i absolutely love the tactics menu the new scouting system and more player interaction even though this game does have its issues it should not be discouraged to play it i am sure these issues are being brought up by si and they are trying to fix it personally even with its bugs it is a better and more challenging game than fm14 710 peace <3 edit si officialy released a patch fixing issues with the goalkeepers and the own goals <3 si

i dont know why there is so much negative reviews out there the game is great and the new scouting is much more realistic now ive played this version since the beta 12 november and ive only encountered 3 crashes overall so dont worry too much about that new interface feels great just need to get used to it regarding the me there seem to be a lot of goal from crosses making a tactic with wingers like 451 maybe too rewarding ive already played 100hours in several top and bottom div and i havent noticed much irrealistics things happening you still get a few dumb keeperesdc mistakes but  happens irl as well so np the databases are up to date except for the french leagues because sadly french scouts are lazy but theres already a patch out there for ligue 1 and 2 so no worries overall pretty solid new opus i have 700 hours on most fm since fm2010 people need to stop crying when city chelsea the psg etc are buying wonderkids for 20millions because thats whats happening irl duh

hello i would like to say at the point of writting this review i had only had this game for the weekend free weekend game i avoided buying this game due to the reviews claiming injury problems and such on at first in my career i struggled to win my team let in goal after goal the good old we score 2 they score 3 scenario i made some changes to the coaching staff changed training and now my team is in the top four managing newcastle eith only one signing danny ings the game does have a few minor bugs and some of the layouts are very confusing and while the simulation of the football isnt perfect it has come a long way since 2013 my previous version of the game im going to snatch this up while its on sale for sure for those who struggle to begin with i reccomend start out a feeling career and then re start with the same club refining what you want the players to play like

first days play there is a lot of familiarity here and also a lot of new learnings the ui has been revamped giving more of a taskbar feel and for me not a bad layout at all i can get to more frequent places in game with one or two clicks now rather than 3 or 4 which is appreciated takes a little getting used to in finding your way around but that was expected im playing with england being playable and every other country viewable filters include all regions top league players coming it at about 130000 some nice new features include the touchline shouts which im still looking at the effects but generally seem to be working ok some tweaks with the scouting and man management options too which i like a lot the engine itself is different enough to distinguish itself from previous games yet isnt a true evolvement more upgrade than paradigm shift visuals have been upgraded all over i really like the tactic options feels more rounded now lots of nice shortcuts very happy with the purchase and looking forward to having long careers

sports interactive has taken a long look at their primary tactical setup and made changes to make it more relatable to their audience and also more analogous to the influence that reallife managers are able to exert as long as they keep pulling tricks like this football manager is a series that will remain evergreen but the biggest improvement to this game has got to be the match engine year after year were used to the buggy disappointing experience especially for us 3d users but from what ive seen out of my first play currently 18 games into my season excluding friendles i havent seen 1 bug maybe im lucky but for a beta thats impressive its much more fluid and all of the new animations that have been added has really added to the realism the new interface has got to be the biggest plus aswell alot more cleaner kinda looks like a andriod tablet set up with the left hand bar down the side and even when youre scrolling down youre squad list or scout list it feels alot more optimized the game has improved big time on processing speeds im running the same size database with the same leagues as before england scotland spain brazil portugal mls france and germany and the rest of the leagues on view only with a player base of 92000 which doesnt struggle which was one of the down points of fm14 although it was fast there was sometimes youd be going to youre browser while you were waiting theyve also added a new feature where you can choose youre licence and past playing experience which i found to be pretty amazing although i havent fully understood it yet but ill be sure to update this when i do i havent tried classic mode as of yet but looking foward to having a go at it hopefully theyve improved it this year with less clutter and more stats all in all i have to give this game a 910 which is pretty damn impressive for a beta one last thing we still have leaderboards was getting scared as i was seeing tons of ruhmours about it not being in this years version but they were proved wrong hopefully workshop comes back this year too i will be updating this once the offical release on novemember the 7th

there is certainly a lot more going on in this years iteration of fm  certain elements have been changed massively from the fm14 look whilst some have received only a mild tweaking this tends to be the case nearly every year and dont always result in an improved product the changes made this year have largely been pleasing although in particular i am not a fan of the new tactics board it seems like the information i need is still there but it is hidden behind extra menus and mouse clicks generally creating what feels to me like an inefficient system when compared to fm14 the gameplay has remained largely the same and is familiar to anyone who has spent time with the series the engine seems to have been improved in some areas and regressed in others again mirroring previous versions of the game there seem to be more goals going in more goals from crosses and set pieces and more defensive errors the game also seems harder and learns an inflexible managers tactics rather quickly i only use the 2d classic view so cant comment on the 3d match engine i have never used it or had any interest in it fundamentally its still great fun to build and develop a team to argue with other managers and to lead your club to glory or glourious defeat i would definitely recommend this to anyone with more than a passing interest in the franchise and it represents a solid return on investment in terms of new features and gameplay hours

i shall try keep this brief as this is making me miss more time in game i have only played this version and its predecessor fm 14 was a great game in its own right and not many improvments needed to be done in my opinion then i strarted fm 15 straight away you can see the changes esp with the new and improved interface it does take a little time getting used to but it is alot more in depth the tactics page you have alot more options on this giving players more options on how to play one of the major flaws however in this years edt of the game which i hope they fix with a patch is how many players get injured in a season it feels more of an action game that could rival max payne games my squad lost 3 keepers for 4 months all due to the same injury at around the same time that is also not to mention all the other injuries i suffered thru the season i also played an internation competion as england and somehow managed to beat germany 8  2 as much as i loved the sore line to the game and i buzzed for a while in reality this is not possible overall the game is very addictive and if youre into these kind of games a must buy

ive picked up fm 2015 after 5 years abstinence and im hooked again match engine has improved since the release with each patch but again there is still room for improvement every new patch states that keeper reactions are fixed but i still fear every shot on goal and slow keeper reactions after the save everyone is complaining about tactical incosistency how you can beat real madrid and loose next match against a lower league team but its good to change up your formation and tactics from time to time for me at least it is something that i like and keeps me playing ui is useful and easy to learn overall game speed is ok im usualy playing with 78 different nation leagues and didnt experience any lag i have no complaints on training and youth development i dont like high transfer values and money spent for weeklymonthly wages but then again thats how it works in reality does it have that addiction spice in the whole mix yes it does at least for me it has  ive been playing fm old cm since i was 13 years old and now im 35  is it worth 50 euros no it certainly is not but then again i didnt have any problem spending that ammount of money because i want to support developers for making one of my favourite games

i buy fm every other year so can only comapre it to 2013 i think the layout of menus has improved although it takes a little while to get used to interactions with players staff and media is a lot better i wouldnt say that the match engine is vastly inferior to 2013 i recommend this

finally a reason to buy a new installment of this classic try the demo for free if you are an exaddict like me tldr summary player interaction massively improved coaching during the match massively improved match representation slightly improved if they used cgi capture for those movements than they have a lot to learn tactical finetuning  massively improved your profile as manager has a big impact on the game tracksuit or tactical manager transfers are more immersive  players will actually ask for a transfer if a big team shows interest like the sound of that read for more i bought every version from championship manager 2 1995ish to football manager 2010 then i bought 2011 on discount 2012 on discount and 2013 on discount and i realised i was stupid i was basically paying for a databaseupdate a brilliant update dont get me wrong but the game never moved on i skipped 2014 after playing the demo i just wasnt interested and decided to go back to championsip manager 0102 and try and safe sheffield wednesday from doom the gameplay was basically a bit simpler but no less engrossing i doubted about getting this so i tried the demo  and it worked more games need demos but aside from that the interface has finally undergone a modernisation process although at times annoying because you cant find things that were previously easily accessible i tried to find where jobs went for example but if it had just been the interface i still would have felt duped there is more to it than just the interface some of this might be gaming elements that were introduced in 2014 i am not sure because i never played that so a few examples to augment the tldr list this is from my first two games wednesday in the demo and wrexham in the full version interaction with players jeremy helan my french leftback is injured but comes back a couple of weeks before the transfer deadline his first game he plays well despite not being matchfit for some reason olympique marseille shows some interest in him and he requests to be allowed to speak to them i calmly tell him that i will if they put an acceptable offer forward they never did and he didnt grumble instead carrying on coaching during the match my fm manager persona is that of a calm occassionally passionate tracksuit manager in my wrexham career that calmness got severely tested when in a game my right back who had woefully underperformed all season got sent off wrongly and we conceded a penalty against bottom of the league welling we were 3th in the conference and smiling we go 10 down but i keep telling my players to concentrate and we pull one back just before the break after my central defender suffers injury after i used all my subs in the 60th minute they score another goal very quickly i tell my guys that there is no pressure and they manage to limit the damage with 9 man on the pitch to a 31 undeserved loss the following game however my captain and central midfielder gets himself sent off in the 10th minute despite me telling my team to not go hard into tackles he was just stupid we concede in the 23th minute and i tell my guys to show some passion we nearly score but in the 34th minute my left back gets his second yellow card in 3 minutes again down to 9 men but this time against gateshead a decent team they take us to pieces and end up losing 40 throughout the game i have been telling them there is no pressure anymore i needed to to manage morale following game after fining the idiots that got sent off i make some tactical alterations to fill in the gaps left by the banned players but it doesnt work woking score in the 24th minute and we seem unable to resist i change things around on the fly pushing them all higher encouraging them telling them they can do it and they do end of the game we have won 41 i have never felt so immersed with the actual matches in fm the animations are still mostly pointless playing this on a low gpu power laptop though but it doesnt matter you can now really put your mark on things from the sideline more effectively than ever before i might revisit this review when i have finished a few seasons but i have to give this version a massive thumbsup and if you are an expired fan of the series then treat yourself to this one

i was thinking that this game will be a simple copy of fm2014 it is not and it is better i cant say that is a lot of new improvements because its false however there three main important things  new interface leftside useful navigation  new tips and very intuitive  a new physics motor more realistic so if you like watching some matches then buy it

do play this game if you like bashing your head against your keyboard whenever your defense plays a horrible backpass and the other team scores dont play this game if you want to have a social life

this will be a twofold review while somethings in the review is related together non football fans this game is vastly huge in terms of stat and detail make sure that you constantly take care of your team and watch what you say because every action could affect the reputation of the team and you i highly suggest you read up on guides or watch lps of this game also ask the steam community of this game for advice for newcommers like myself its an enjoyable game but really high on detail which is always nice to see lastly the online side of things i highly suggest playing with newcomers to get accquianted with the game together rather than having an expert a familiar and a noob playing the game football fans this game is meant for the gamer who loves football this game strives to achieve what everyone who loves football wants to do run your own team choose your teams style of training pick players trade players negoitate for contracts and deals its really a good simulator for manager games and if you grow tried of singleplayer action try online in all honesty the online portion feels like a louge game just sit back relax and have fun speaking of which this game isnt meant to be taken too seriously its a managment sim lol also with mod support the game will become either better or more challenging depending upon your time of playstyle another thing this game goes all out in terms of keeping you and your friends in the loop through social media venues as well the only real negavtive about this game is lack of updates now this could be because of the choices you made in the game but even then if a player is injuried i want to know first thing so i can respond to that another thing is that the mood system isnt all that great since the game doesnt really outline difference in mood apporches to handling players the board of the team your representing and other teams lastly the media do i recommend it yes i do for football fans who have seen and pratically worship this sport as for newcomers i also recommend it however i do advise you do some research and ask people for opinions

get the snacks ready guys this is going to be a long one ive been playing fm properly since 09 and this visually is definately the most pleasing on the eye although it is expected with most games that are in a series each year graphics improve etc but ive noticed in previous years the creators talk about our new and improved match engine whereas in reality it isnt much different but i have to admit this year there is a difference the 3d match engine is actually really evident football manager to me was always a game that every part of it seemed as close to realism as it could yet when it came to the matches it just let the whole feel of realism down a touch the players movement looks better the shooting passing diving tackling all just looks better although i dont think they thought through the appearence of players that well eg aaron cresswell west ham left back had ginger hair in my game the interface of the menu screens has had a huge revamp in previous years the interface had hardly changed and it kind of made me question in what is the point in buying a game that looks the same just maybe updated teams hence the reason i stopped buying fifa but this game actually looks like a new game to a certain extent the originial drop down bar which is now down the left side of the screen is a great feature with added tabs in the bar it makes navigating around quicker which for me makes the game more enjoyable but that is just a personal preference im not sure if its to do with the game itself but from the last time i played fm14 until now i had upgraded my pc and bought a highend graphics card so the general visual aspects of the game may vary depending on your own pcs gpu but for me it looks great especially with the added facepacks bages kits etc the actual features of the game have been improved aswell the tactics screen has had a complete change to selecting players and player roles including new roles which once i got use to the functions of it all seemed like a good way they have upgraded from the normal tactics drag and drop & click 2 buttons done i havent played as much as some but long enough i think to make a judgement on the game and i appreciate that the game is still in beta and will have some bugs like 9 of my first squad players getting injured in preseason and my cb getting sentoff 4 game he played in a row but come november 7th on full release i think we will all have a fantastic game to enjoy for the next 12 months be it if your a experienced fm player like myself or if its the first time picking up the game & if you are a newbie little tip for you coaches will save your season but anyway guys work tommorow and its way past my bed time hopefully we can all enjoy this new fm installment cherriooo

ive been playing football manager since fm 2011 and have been hooked with the series ever since fm 15 is a great advancement in the series with great new ideas implemented into the game however i feel that some features need to be refined as it did not keep me as entertained as fm 14 did the implementation of the tactical and tracksuit manager was a good idea in theory but i did not feel it had a major impact within the game as you were never really prompted to pursue coaching badges or felt it had any real impact within the game the new user interface was a great change within the as i felt it made it much more compact and concise as well as being more convenient on the left hand side of the page the changes to the match engine were extremely broken at first with the countless gk and defensive mistakes however after many patches they were fixed and i can see the improvement from the previous years overall fm 15 has been a good iteration of the football manager series having quite a few improvements than its previous ones however my hope for fm 16 would be that these features be kept but improved upon and refined 8510
