this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counterstrike here you go i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house when i saw the counterstrike logo i was filled with gamegasm  and i was so happy i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then so the journey started i was playing it hardcore made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself counterstrike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful in a pleasant way ofcourse shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way sometimes the most simple games like counterstrike are the ones that live to this day also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game the gameplay is very simple  defend as a counterterrorist attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counterstrike so i am sharing here more of my experience i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008 so i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago i think counterstrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist i am sure many of people already have played games like csgo but never the roots i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from csgo and modern games

ive played this game since i was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever i launch it to this very day over 12 years of endless entertainment no other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than counterstrike 16 has and i doubt no game ever will reason ive only got 38 hours here is because i no longer use the account i originally played cs 16 on func_vehicle is what makes this counter strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world you can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it do i need to say more mods on this game are amazing too there is a mod where you can catch pokemon level them up train them and use their skills call of duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self warcraft mods zombie mods basebuilder and so on there is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles 133710 leet crew 5 lyf kicks csgos  by a mile i forgot how good wallbanging is in this game ps  cs 16 is the only counter strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy riot shields enjoy

after 14 years of existence this legendary game is still in the steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world  while earning tons of money based on counterstrike sales valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesnt even exist even more starting with february 2013 valve has released a couple of minor updates for counterstrike which intentionally created problems for the gamesuddenly stopping afterwards so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy csgowhich currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection  problem present on all source engine based multiplayers since 2004 congratulations valve  counting the players that migrated to or play the nonsteam version of counterstrike the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world

lock and load go go go fire in the hole the bomb has been planted counterterroriststerrorists win it is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercafs across the world for many days were spent in front of the computer screen manipulating the wasd keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one people yell and frown they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyberpersona and pit them against another team it doesnt matter who won who lost who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins what is important is that for those who are a part of the team this computer game is their reality these personas within the computer screen are their true identities this is counterstrike originally a modification mod in short made for valves critically acclaimed halflife counterstrike has gained much prominence since its initial launch it is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multiplayer computer games of all times it is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions such as esea league of course this does not put counterstrike as a professional only game as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch getting started with counterstrike is simple you start off in one of the two teams counterterrorists or terrorists before the round begins you will have to purchase your own gun from the market namely the famous ak47 m4a1 desert eagle mp5 awp and many more do not ask me why the counterterrorists namely the police have to buy their own gun and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the swats have to buy their own guns no one knows but at least this will balance up the game also you can equipment such as highlyexplosive grenades flashbangs not recommend for beginners smoke grenades helmets and kevlars you can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counterterrorist but normally we will steal that from dead teammates oh and you will be given a knife for free dont worry about it as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else the gameplay is fairly straightforward as well there are quite a few number of game mods the most frequently played ones are the bomb defusal maps such as the alltime famous de_dust the hostage rescue maps such as cs_assault the vip escorting maps and the kill them all maps such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map like all multiplayer first person shooters you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win dont worry about it though because if you are new just stick around and listen to what others have got to say just remember you are not john rambo you only have 100 hp and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle awp will deal more damage than that as time press on the mechanism of counterstrike became outdate of course the legacy of counterstrike continues through its successors such as counterstrike condition zero counterstrike source counterstrike online asia only and the newest of all counterstrike global offensive throughout the years counterstrike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains together with halflife and maybe team fortress classic counterstrike has not only helped valve to thrive as a gaming company but also defined what first person shooter should be

nice oldschool game counterstrike is very cool game but now we can play the cs series of games like cssource and csgo i cant say which game is better its your choice but i cant forget this game like my childhood thanks to valve for it
recommended
this game is unlike the other counter strike games this game requires a different type of skill you have to become used to the recoil each weapon has you also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map i personally think this is the best counterstrike game

counterstrike review by delicioushotschmoes release date june 19 1999 genre firstperson shooter developers valve corporation platforms pc xbox os x linux the review first starting off as a cute little mod based on the goldsrc engine a heavily modified quake engine counterstrikes legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over initially developed and released on top of a halflife modification with the inspiration from the developers strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism the mods success was immediately a marvel to behold selling over 25 million units as a whole in the counterstrike franchise the maps and various scenarios set around the globe players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams counterterrorists and terrorists both with a task depending differently on the mission bomb scenarios the terrorist team must plant a bomb in a secured bomb location while the counterterrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb if it may have been planted hostage scenarios is where the counterterrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists with both these modes it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels the player depending on what team they have been assigned to can change their class into eight different character models as well as buying weaponry and equipment such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team as the round is about to begin youre left in freeze time that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before this of course gives players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents this game is also highly customizable on the players endthe game gives the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins spray graphics sprites sound effects and huds that can be used ingame i forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes counterstrike such a versatile game to begin with i dont have much to complain about this game other than its become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters since its release aimbots that autotarget other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed wallhacks that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspective to me the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall theres a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and oldschool oldschool is for nostalgic value something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories youve experienced and this is what the first title of counterstrike engulfs outdated being something you dont particularly want to go back to while there is the famous remake counterstrike source that runs on the more powerful and overlyrecycled source engine allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities nevertheless if youre looking for original flare that is burning in the counterstrike series this game is definitely for you and to think all of this success for the counterstrike series began as small little mod proof on how something so little can create something so big recommended

counter strike is even fight between highly trained american antiterrorist team using latest in military technology to battle a group of really  madmen possessing crude bomb and surplus from ussr 1980s army supplies despite all training and technology terrorists still have good chance of blowing up market therefore much like real life game is currently full of hackers who fly on top of map so unless you hack or like getting aerial teabag please play better counter strike sauce or counter strike go game this game has had its day and only exists for historical purposes i remember times when internet cafe and mosque full of this game no more
