 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

my god i have not had this much fun since i discovered tf2 warframe easily takes the cake for one of the best free to play games on steam theres a nice balance between what you can get without paying a cent and buying stuff which imo is what makes this game so good i was always a sucker for thirdperson shooters and this might as well be my favorite the gunplay is a bit bumpy starting off but once you get through the first mastery rank test there are many weapons to choose from something i really like about this game is that it lets you play how you wanna play you can be be at the sidelines of the battle assisting your team and picking off targets you can mess with your opponent lining them up for a perfect slash dash you can soak up hits while your team flanks for the objective or you can  all the ninja  and come from the front guns blazing also melee play is an actual and reliable choice the controls are laughably easy to get into after an hour i was completely used to it and now with the new update 14 there is an new and better intro to the game it might take a while to discover what this does how that works what happens when i do this etc but that can be cleared away with a quick look at the wiki i would give it a 810 has yet to disappoint me

warframes relaxed take on third person combat impressive visuals and vast combat customization lets it appeal to both hardcore gamers as well as weekend warriors latency issues and high system requirements can put off many but its free to play model is fair all of the content is provided to players free of charge and that makes it difficult not to recommend it to everyone you assume the role of one of the tenno an ancient group of warriors that were placed in cryogenic stasis in order to survive a losing waryour character then awakens to find the solar system in extreme turmoil caught in a war between three major factions and being the only ones able to disrupt the stalemate they soon attract attention awoken and lead by a mysterious identity going by the alias lotus the tennos intentions continue to remain unknown warframes third person combat is simple but refined providing a very relaxed and smooth shootemup feel while a complex but easy to follow weapon modification system offers endless customization to the gameplay enemies will drop many modifications during missions which allow players to change weaponry and their character to improve combat performance without limitation this design allows players to modify all of the smallest aspects of their character and weaponry while maintaining the games rpg elements each of the weapons have their own specific function attack patterns and style which further compliment your playstyle dying can come across as cheap as some enemies will stun lock players to death or simply hit through their shields for an instantkill included to increase difficulty it often feels unjustified and overly punishing mission maps are generated randomly based on preexisting tile sets depending on the planet and type of mission chosen each mission has a specific objective however many of these feel overly similar often consisting of back tracking and repetitive fetch quests missions are unlocked by completing the adjacent nodes connected to them however this soon branches off into many directions though many of these use the same tilesets as the previous mission with only a few varying objectives between the two missions can often feel too similar to one another on a single planet giving little reason to play ones that branch away from the main path the matchmaking system can be frustrating offering little choice in terms of selecting a mission or joining a game already in progress offering no options besides public or private you may often find yourself leaving a laggy game only to be thrown back in again numerous times the matchmaking system definitely needs work and its constantly overlooked throughout updates warframes free to play model uses microtransactions to speed up the acquisition of weapons and characters with the use of in game currency called platinum free users are still able to access all content within the game but will struggle to gain access to everything without consistent farming for materials and parts needed to create new weapons platinum allows players to directly purchase weapons and characters without the need to craft and collect materials with free players able to access all content while giving paying customers faster access to new content warframe shows how the free to play model doesnt have to alienate nonpaying users while warframe doesnt provide the adrenaline fueled action were accustomed to in shooters its shootemup style combat remains satisfying for many hours and the endless customization options add much needed padding to help overcome the repetition the heavy reliance on a random loot table for item drops throughout the game can lead to extreme frustration at times especially when farming for a specific item bugs can be prominent at times especially the ones that affect the user interface however most major issues are fixed quickly with a hotfix provided by the development team pros  stunning visuals especially for more powerful video cards  plenty of weapons and characters to level up  customization allows any type of design and playstyle which adds replay value  frequent content updates cons  dying can feel unfair at times leaving the player stunlocked until death  matchmaking system needs work often selecting poor hosts  high repetition within missions  high system requirements  microtransactions are a little overpriced while rough around the edges at times most bugs and technical issues are not persistent as long as you can meet the system requirements and bandwidth isnt a limitation theres no reason not to give warframe a try with its fair free to play model if you enjoyed this review please check out the analog reviews steam group where we strive to provide honest and unbiased reviews httpsteamcommunitycomgroupsanalogreviewsofficial

warframe is a great game with a few issues surrounding it the pros in my opinion are you never feel pressured to buy platinum since trading is easy and so is getting credits each frame character that ive owned have all felt unique and pleasurable to play the game looks gorgeous hands down its use of lighting and such make it look fantastic the missions while repetitive at times are enjoyable especially if you have a friend with you there is a great variety of frames weapons and mods to challenge yourself to learn coop is easy and lagfree as far as what ive experienced the cons are the game can bug out at times missions can be slightly repetitive as said before some players may just stand around doing nothing or be bad at the game in summary pick this game up if you have a few friends with it and become a ninja today

an excellent example of f2p game done right pros  nice graphics  dynamic and engaging gameplay  unique visual style and story  good coop pve experience  nonintrusive and balanced monetization  excellent devs communication and feedback  game is constantly developing and new features become available regularly cons  the gameplay becomes grindy over time  pvp is almost nonexistent so i higly recommend this game if you are into coop pve thirdperson shooters its a kind of game when if you get tired of it  you can always take a break return at some later point and see a lot of new and interesting stuff added with the latest updates

there are very few games that have held my attention for 1000 hours over the years this is one of them i created an account back when the game was still in alpha late 2012 back then it was was just a simple module with some enemies to kill with a handful of warframes to choose from even then though it showed promise over time they have added tons of content new warframes weapons galore new planets mission types archwing fly in space events clan dojos and foundry player to player trading system syndicates to join player hubs relay stations pvp 8 player raid etc etc if you enjoy third person shooters 4 player coop pvp raiding rpgs andor ninjas in space lol this game is a dream come true then for you being that it is free to play there is literally nothing to lose checking it out the game is a constant work in progress and the developer digital extremes de is constantly tweaking and adding new content all the time warframe has a very decent crafting system and you will most likely find yourself trying many different warframesweapons combinations to see which ones fit your style the best believe me the game encourages you to do so it is surprising the amount of variety in the game when you find something you like it is a rewarding feeling and you will too it is just a matter of time also decent customization for your warframes weapons sentinels companion kubrows dog companion liset your ship with a multitude of color choices skins and attachments every warframe has its own set of individual abilities they all have a total of 4 some are better at being tanky dps sneaking cloaking solo play healers aoe damage defense etc there is a warframe for every situation it seems you can also make your own builds for each frame based on what mods you have you attain them while playing missions they are dropped by enemies for example continuity mod allows for longer power duration time when you ability is activated more ammo damage mods etc etc sooooo many making building your perfect warframeweapons very flexible and enjoyable you have the opportunity to have a primary secondary and melee weapon with the opportunity to make your own builds for everything here adds to the games replayability imo same goes for sentinels and kubrow companions they all have their own set of mods especially made for them that being said the game can be very grindy especially for newer players that is to be expected though being that it is an mmoish experience especially to gather enough resources and credits to craft your items well worth it though if you have the time to invest sometimes they seem to nerf warframes and weapons for no reason at all and then they rework it again and fix it nerfunnerf is the nature of free to play mmo ish kind of games constant balance tweaking this is not an instant gratification game either the game gets better the more you play it you can also purchase items with real money from the in game market it is not necessary though most things can be attained just playing the game gathering resources and crafting them accordingly except of course vanity items skins unique color palettes and limited time only items that have been available over the course of the game de sometimes gifts players new color palettes and send them to your inbox valentines day halloween st patricks day etc free weapons too they seem to do somethings special on the games anniversary every year the developer also listens to community feedback and designs and have added many things based on that which is always a plus the game can also get repetitive at times but with the amount of content in game now that is harder to happen you just have to mix it up from time to time and try new things within the game all in all the future looks bright for this game a developer that actually listens to community feedback constant updateshotfixes plus there is so much new content coming soon game is not perfect of course but what game truly is right there is a lot to enjoy here and unique setting and premise to the game definitely sets itself apart from the competition mmos are hard to review but at its current state i give this game a 4 stars       out of 5

warframe was another one of my 40100 hour trips i enjoyed this game i really did i can tell you exactly what i liked and exactly what got me to stop playing make the choice on your own for if the game is worth your time though things i really really liked about the game and why you should play it its free it has an interesting arcade shooter puzzle dungeon layout feel thing going on it has tons of goals to keep you going kubrows are adorable you can play how you like if you like stealth go stealthy if you like running and gunning go do that aaaaaaaaaaaaand you dont have to buy anything you can earn prime blueprints from the void and sell them to suckers other players for platinum generally enjoyable things that pushed me away from the game i guess the only thing that really got me was when i was waiting for the next mission but i had to go through the next few planets to get there kind of a drag and finding groups for normal missions everyone just wants to do void missions and alerts rip matchmaking so now the standard game rating story 1010 enjoyable and forces you to learn how to get a kubrow without paying plat gameplay 1010 arcadeyshootystealthyf2pyfuncoopytimebasedandstuffyeah presentation 910 warframes are ugly but they grow on you and other than that the whole game looks fantastic soundtrack 810 not memorable not annoying having your own music in hurts nothing replayability 1010 this game is great i will come back to play it but rght now im waiting 2 days for playing a new warframe and i just dont feel like grinding i want to provide a second note which may actually be different now as the whole thing seems to be under new management the support guy can blow a  when i went to them the first time with an issue about the game i was playing on a  laptop that wasnt able to run warframe i asked what the problem could be and he told me the stupidest  in the world i cant handle when the support team who is supposed to help just sends you to virus filled websites and helps you in no way whatsoever i simply asked if there could be anything wrong with it and as it turns out i just didnt have a good enough computer big shocker there playing on a laptop from 2007 i would rather him telling me theres nothing that can be done than sending me to a download from a 3rd party site to try and update my drivers using some random virus filled wizard edit after scanning my computer i came across adware on the name of searchprotection it came from the cnet download that i was given so  you old support long live the new now at my normal computer i properly enjoy the game i cant speak highly of their support as of 3 months ago though julyaugust 2014

now half of you will just rate the review unhelpful because its negative but be reminded that every one of these problems is something i want to be fixed not that i laugh about read on if you care or be one of the many who would disregard what i say because they think its bad to point out issues and will blindly follow warframe to the depths of hell itself to shoot down critisizm look at my hours i know what im talking about offputting community with really shortsighted devs first the positives its free to play with some restrictions playing with friends can be a lot of fun the problem is trying to get them to play the game with you its harder than you might think combat is fun albeit a bit buggy at times weapons and frames a quite varied making almost every item a new experience not bad in terms of graphics everything looks like plastic and rubber but hey its a free game now the negatives the game is an infinite power creep the forums i have never met such a nasty group of people in my life the game doesnt have too much grinding the game is grinding you are grinding to grind more the game is ridiculously easy you can get almost every item in the game in just about a month the paywalls unless you only want to have two warframes you gotta pay up that or attempt the horrible trading system the generic enemies of clones and spacemen most of the concepts are quite unoriginal the enemy designs seem to be based on freaking shapes or just generic space zombies straight out of something like halo or dead space the ai barely makes enemies a threat they will suicide rush you solo all while getting slaughtered the bugs this is a beta game but good god its been out for 2 years they simply neglect to fix them hell sometimes they create more bugs than they fix these things are so rampant it actually makes a serious impact on the games sometimes from camera issues to getting stuck in walls bugs ruin so much of the gameplay that it hurts sometimes the balancing de couldnt balance a seesaw some items are worthless others op to the extreme the developers have proved time and time again to be completely incompetent when it comes to the issue of imbalance with weapons and frames they will leave the top teir weapons that completely outclass anything that comes near them alone while nerfing random items that very clearly didnt need it it makes no sense the whole update process is an endless stream of nerfing and ignoring they also just straight up ignore useless frames and items theres nothing more to say they just ignore them the updates most just introduce a shiny version of something already in game or a useless gun the end goal if you dont care about a number next to your name there is none the asskissing de will release a patch to fix something they broke and people thank the  out of them yeah sure that makes sense not to mention any critisism of any of their decisions no matter how stupid they are will be shot down by their white knights the gameplay stealth is a neglected factor entirely the whole game is just trying to get ahead of your squad to try and do more damage any other gamemode is just killing  with some minor objective to focus on while you spam your skills or choice of overpowered weapon the devs greed they will ignore major problems so that they can release a new prime package and find more ways to suck your money out like slots for example the idiotic community just go look at the wiki every pages comments has someone  on a weapon and telling you some other one is better they just bicker endlessly about everything the matchmaking there isnt any you have to go sit in a chat room unless you join a clan which you should be and wait for some rhino prime to join your game unless youre doing normal missions cause then you are  out of luck cause unless some random person is doing the same node at the same time youre doomed to play it solo the money creep of cosmetics every new item that comes out is more expensive than the last you know why de does this cause they know their braindead community will eat it the  up and throw tons of money at the screen while mashing thanks de into their keyboard as hard as they can the lack of progress with updates sure they come often but seriously they give us random weapons that whos gonna care about when there is elite top level gear that cannot be outclassed the updates never bring anything new or significant the lack of variety in gamemodes theres like 4 or 5 gamemodes and you better like them cause they are gonna be the only thing you play ever the pvp this should have never been added the conclave is straight up dead being horribly unbalanced and incredibly laggy ill get to the reason behind that next and dark sectors are controlled by clans that use ddos and other shady tactics to force massive taxes down players throats the lack of servers every game is hosted by a player which means lag a lot of lag it sometimes makes the game literally unplayable and its incredibly common the crashing i crash 23 times a day on warframe just my god if i had to list the amount of times i had to altf4 out of the game this review would be three times as long the movement you simply latch on to walls when you wall run nothing feels natural every jump every vault they all feel stilted and slow not to mention sometimes you just fly mach 5 across the map when you jump from a sliding position the jumps are so irregular the melee combat you run up to the enemy mash the e key and you might hit them its completely random and just like other weapons melee weapons are completely unbalanced for the most part heavy weapons are useless and certain weapons destroy the rest hands down its borderline  the argon issue every new weapon requires argon crystals as an artificial way to make them harder to obtain this simply comes from des issue of being uncreative with ways to acquire new weaponry the fact that certain frames are one trick ponies certain frames are only used for one sometimes two abilities while the rest of their entire arsenal is completely ignored the lack of a challenge this somewhat correspondes with the game being too easy with a certain frame and weapon anything can be completed by a braindead child people actually have to make up their own endgame of getting to high waves simply to have the risk of being defeated the lack of a skill requirement as i said directly above so long as you have the right weapon and frame you can conqeur literally anything there is no reward for being good at the game in fact you dont even have to try your best simply having the numbers 1234 on your keyboard is enough to be just as good as anyone else the most ignorant developers ive ever seen here is an example there is a weapon called the dark dagger it is awful as every single handed dagger is however the hilarity insues when you realise that the tiny dark dagger is around the same speed as the giant two handed hammer fragor and you think thats bad none of the dagger stances actually match the dark daggers stance polarity none that is the most idiotic thing ive ever heard in my life to be honest if you want to play with other people join a clan most of the community is elitism  who dont care about the gameplay and are simply waiting for the next prime to come out the more people who dislike this only proves what im talking about with the asskissing every one of these points is true no matter how much people will try to deny them fanboys will be ignored and most likely have their rant deleted think before you post

my review of warframe warframe is an amazing game with a truly original story and setting in the year 2029 austria birth place of hitler arnold schwarzenegger money boy and joseph fritzl decided to place a ban on all other forms of national production farms were closed factories shut down and local stores were forced out of business the only businesses allowed to operate were the ports for importing food to feed the now practically enslaved workforce all national production refocused on the construction of the door frame austrias answer to your door hanging needs by the year 2031 rogue factions within the austrian government decided it was time to strike uploading a selective virus in to the entire nations production lines this led to the creation of the war frame a door frame so focused on war that it caused conflict wherever it was mounted homes across the globe now featured austrian doorframes and unfortunately a rogue batch of warframes were also set loose across the globe these warframes were notorious sealing front doors to homes to prevent you visiting your neighbours sealing doorways to places of worship so people could no longer pray to their chosen gods and gradually over time the world fell to darkness and chaos as even the doorways to power plants and gas stations refused to open some warframes gained sentience and self awareness and as they saw the human uprising finally coming to fruition their evil colleagues and companions burned in the streets and smashed to splinters they rose up to assist their human allies in the fight against their own kind you take the role of one of nineteen types of warframe from oak to pine to cedar wood the choices are limitless your skills totally customizable from tea tray services to opening for the elderly as one of the newly freed warframes you must take up the mantle of freedoorm fighter fighting across not only earth but the moon mars and titan to free the oppressed human people from their true foes the evil warframes of the austrian megadoorframecorp 1110 would open and close door again

pros  there seem to be lots of updates rolling out things like guilds space stations for your guilds etc  and as a result the game is already much better than it was in march  for a free to play game warframe has top of the line graphics and controls  a huge variety of warframes mods and weapons results in a lot of customization potential  running around as a space ninja is obviously gonna be a recipe for a good time cons  the game is basically a grindfest to find materials with which to construct items and at this stage the gameplay definitely gets repetitive fast  not only does the gameplay get repetitive but the locations strongly remind me of early halos copy paste level design  the story has been worked on since the beta started but its still pretty threadbare andor incomprehensible  as every mission is an instanced encounter its sometimes very difficult to find other people to group with on the lower level planets  even when you do manage to find a group there is almost no communication teamwork or strategy instead everyone is just essentially racing one another through the level to get to the loot furthermore the game even aids this mentality by providing an exclamation mark on your minimap directing you through whichever mission you are in helping you maintain top speed at all times verdict my first instinct was to add another piece of slag to the stuff listed above that i feel this game is a little too far towards paytowin on the freemium scale my reasoning for this is that it just takes so much time to get new warframes and armor without caving and paying real money i played warframe for around 22 hours and i only managed to build one new sword and one item enhancer in my opinion thats a really poor rate of return add to this that the packs you can buy with real money are 40 bucks or more on steam i got mine for $10 during the summer sale and its easy to see that the game is designed to siphon away either your money or your time the thing is this is maybe the only kind of situation where im not enraged at what i would normally decry as pay2win  this system works because the game is almost entirely pve and you arent really competing against anyone due to this important distinction i feel like the player cant really resent it when others pay real money for fatter lewts because the only time you see them is when youre helping one another kill stuff though it waxes too far into a grindfest for my tastes warframe is a decent freetoplay with nice graphics and uncomplicated controls see other game reviews and articles at gamesmeltercom

gameplay the player starts off with a simple questline which guides him to restore parts of his ship whilst learning the basic mechanics of the game the player learns the majority of the controls through ingame 3d prompts making the learning smoother and more integrated with the gameplay itself minimally experienced players can easily get the hang of things and start slashing their way through hordes of enemies of course later on your character can become very agile with the proper upgrades and this can be used for some advanced and fun maneuvers all of which are beautifully animated and visible from the 3rd person perspective in which the game is played after this initial learningtutorial phase the player can freely play replayable nodes on select planets and moons in the solar system each unlocking another celestial body with every completed boss fight node the maps are seperated in rooms that fit with one another like puzzle pieces with every level being somewhat randomized in order for it to not get repetitive if you were to replay a node depending on the planet and enemy different tilesets are used to further minimize the redundancy of replaying a level every node is a specific type of mission ranging from exterminate kill all the enemies to mobile defense where you must defend certain points on the map you have 3 weapons primary secondary and melee how you mix these up is completely up to you as there are some players who go fullout melee and others that like to remain far from their targets with sniper rifle primaries on top of your weapons you have your warframe a body of armor that allows you to use the 4 abilities unique to your warframe there are currently hundreds of weapons over 20 warframes and more are being added as the game progresses warframes and weapons alike level up to a maximum level of 30 gaining 1 mod capacity for each level this capacity is used to install mods dropped from enemies or rewarded for certain missions these mods are a core mechanic of the game and can be treated as a sort of loot system as most weapons are obtainable from the market through crafting these mods upgrade your speed power health add a certain damage type to your weapon the list goes on and on mods themselves can be upgraded by sacrificing other mods in order to increase the initial statistic on the mod it gets a bit complicated to explain although its very simple once you develop an understanding of which mods suit your gamestyle and how to best mod your loadout your mastery level increases as you gain levels for weapons and warframes and eventually allows you to buy and build even more powerful weaponry on top of that you can be accompanied by a companion be it a sentinel that flies behind your shoulder and shoots enemies or a kubrow wolflike creature that can render you and itself invisible from foes these companions can take on a specific strategic role depending on which one you decide to get they and their weapons also level up and there are mods for them as well not only are all these things upgradeable but you can also custimize every single one with emblems and your own color scheme the overall feel is very entertaining and fun theres nothing more satisfying than watching your enemies get split in half whilst you slash your sword through their torso or having their head explode after you rain a barrage of bullets onto them there is indeed a grind and the maps might begin to seem repetitive although this is masked by the pure fun and addictive nature of warframe recently a new update called archwing has been released allowing the player to fly out into space this heavily 3d based combat is as fun and enjoyable as the onfoot combat the archwing its ranged weapon as well as its melee are also upgradeable just like all other tools the player utilizes graphics it looks great and if youve got an nvidia card physx makes it even better with more particles than your eyes can handle its made for new machines though so your old pcs might not handle it well otherwise looks great performs great story in warframe you are a spaceninja tenno awoken by lotus and sent on a mission to keep balance between the three factions grineer corpus and infested this is unfortunately where warframe falls a tad bit short the story itself has potential and if you were to read the lore on the wiki page and forums you could easily develop an interest for the plot the game itself however rarely attempts to engage the player in this story aside from the beginning quest and a couple of other missions for the archwing kubrow or a few warframes the story is fundementally absent this can be either a good or bad thing as some players would prefer to stick to simply killing the baddies and levelling up much of the story can be experienced through the codex where the player must scan enemies in order to gain information about them and their origin although this is indeed a way of making the player learn about the story through their own effort scanning enemies is not encouraged enough to motivate players to go out and learn the lore for those who are interested though this can be a very fun mechanic this greatly depends on your preference in how indepth the plot is so how much this affects the game itself varies if you are curious to know about the plot i urge you to read about it here [warframewikiacom]  community the warframe community is usually nice and welcoming i have had some bad experiences with certain players although in almost all cases it is very enjoyable to play with others up to four players can be in a single mission and warframe members are free to create giant clans with their own dojos and seperate rooms for item r&d warframe is primarily pve although there are certain mission nodes where players may battle against other tenno players can also trade mods and this means money can get involved free2play warframe as any f2p game has microtransactions thankfully this is not a pay2play game especially since the gameplay focuses primarily on pve combat players can however purchase xp boosters and credit boosters as well as weapons with real money all weapons and mods with the exception of limitedtime exclusive items are fully obtainable through regular gameplay the large portion of purchasable items are purely cosmetic overview all in all warframe is a very fun and addictive 3rd person instancebased small team hackslashshooter it is especially fun in groups and the constant flow of updates keeps it fresh and new and hey why not give it a try its free

at its core warframe has the potential to be an enjoyable game with fastpaced acrobatic combat it evokes the feeling of oldschool fastrunning shooters i even got flashbacks to the specialists but for every minute of enjoyment i got out of the game an hour of disappointment presented itself as a freetoplay game there was an expectation for some grind but grind is deliberately an essential part of the game for the same reason it is in subscriptionbased games to encourage users to purchase platinum in fact every decision by the developer seems oriented around profit as someone used to the hobbyist approach of indie developers this bothered me but even beyond that there just isnt much of the game here the missions are repetitive all factions use a swarm mentality the ai is shallow and simple and there isnt much variety in the weapons the game is purely gearbased if you dont have the correct mods which you have to grind for or good weapons beyond the starting gear which is deliberately weaker than most weapons then theres just no amount of skill that can compensate for that despite community feedback weaker weapons rarely if ever get buffed up to the current power curve and instead get retired to the vault to make room for even more powerful new purchases unless youre allergic to variety there is a paywall you only get access to a paltry amount of slots for warframes and weapon slots and you can only purchase them with platinum you cant even grind for them like you need to with everything else so if you want to try a new frame be prepared to sell the old one finally just as most freetoplay games the price of ingame currency is bloated beyond belief the cheapest warframe costs 75 platinum which is a $5 purchase more expensive frames cost up to $20 worth of platinum for that price you could just get another game there are occasionally discounts you can receive for logging in daily but these are exceedingly rare overall despite how many hours this game has given me i just cant recommend it most of those hours i cant even recall as they consisted of mindless farming for neurodes or orokin cells so i could have something new to play with but only a small part of it was actually fun if you really love grind or repetitive shallow gameplay you might like it but if you want challenge depth or a developer that cares about more than making money this game isnt for you

what is power the corpus ability to field destructive cutting edge technology to impose their will on their foes or perhaps is it the sheer amount of capital they possess to influence man markets and bureaucracy alike how about the grineer whose sole purpose in life is their devotion to their queens and total domination of the universe what they lack in technology and in capital they more than make up in conviction and their endless numbers neither in warframe you represent power the power to end conflicts with a swing of your sword the power to tilt the balance of power between civilizations at will the power to render technology obsolete because you are a living weapon the run down pros  customization at its finest everything can be recolored mods are available to further enhance yourself weapons and kubrow because wrecking one army isnt enough everyone has to go  parkour prerequisite for ninja status  graphics  everything can be found without paying but patience is a must  raids a step in the right direction  developers engage with community frequent updates cons  f2p but pay for convenience nearly any weapon mod and warframe can be bought with money the only limits being the size of your wallet and the amount of trades available per day determined by rank  end game can be monotonous and certain frames consist of spamming one or two buttons to kill entire rooms of enemies rng is a big factor in drops  pvp is a work in progress  experiences connection issues and bugs at times youll feel powerful but perhaps at least in this case can too much power be a bad thing end game becomes a cake walk once you have your warframe and weapons properly geared worth a shot if playing casually but towards end game when youre literally a walking god dont expect much of a challenge

 update 24414 it has been a fairly significant chunk of time since i wrote this review of warframe and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues i originally had the premium currency platinum can now be traded between players this provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store  if you want them youll need to grind multiple new game modes exist including invasion a mode which allows players to team up together with the corpus or the grineer to work against the opposing faction this mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission the latest update introduced melee 20 which delivered improvements to the games melee combat the most interesting update comes in the form of dark sectors clans and alliances can own parts of the solar system and can fight for that contested ownership clans and alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories leading to territorial battles for supremacy in conclusion a decent amount of content has been added to the game while the core argument of my review holds true warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game the new eve onlineesque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard   original review 251113 a greatlooking initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space it has the looks and the gameplay but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank leveling up your weapons and your warframe the games metaphor for various classes each having their own unique abilities advantages disadvantages and so on as you shoot a myriad of alien grineer infested hordes and corpus robots missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective these can all be completed solo but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players higher level missions are tricky by yourself making teaming up the more attractive proposition weapons and warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard action rpg fare  elemental damage bonuses increased critical hit damage faster reload speeds you name it this allows for some diversity in gameplay between players where you may opt to build out your warframe in a more supportive role or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character so far the game has been well supported with semiregular content updates and special events usually in the form of new warframes and weapons and a community effort in which everyone can participate the only issue is that the game is a bit of a grind in fact its a complete grinding game the main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons you can use the games premium currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items which take hours days of real time to craft or simply buy them outright from a storefront why do you want these new weapons and warframes to grind more efficiently for materials this might strike you as a monotonous loop and to an extent it is but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill the game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its free to play nature  you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if youre willing to commit to the grind but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet  namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built its always questionable when a f2p game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds ultimately if youre just looking for a good looking nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic you can do far worse than warframe after spending some time with it however you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available

warframe is a squad based third person shooter with rpg and brawler mechanics where you play as a psychic space ninja known as a tenno which is an oddly adorable and not fittingly threatening name for a species which exists purely to create psychic space ninjas to commit genocide as a day job the game itself is free to play and it means it while theres a cash shop you can buy almost everything in it with ingame credits if youre willing to do a light bit of grinding for everything that isnt purchasable with ingame currency you can farm ingame for the cash shop currency grinding is very important in warframe effectively if you wish to obtain new weapons frames or the like you can either pay for it with the cash shop currency or gather the materials from playing missions pay a fee of ingame currency then wait a few hours or daysreal time regardless of whether or not youre onlinefor it to finish that said the loot system is surprisingly fair and it doesnt take much time to start building an arsenal of weapons and warframes to play around with the storyline is fairly basic but servicable its just tangible enough to help develop immersion and thats all it attempts to do assuming you dont think too hard about how a character can be your mortal enemy but also simultaniously a bisected reanimated corpse and a power hungry commander thats never seen you before warframe would be relatively forgettable if it didnt have its incredibly rewarding surprisingly in depth combat system you have access to a wide variety of weapons ranging from high tech railguns to a whip made from the spine of a feral beast coated in lethal parasitic growths melee combat is deep enough to stand on its own with a variety of weapon classes fighting styles combos and the built in mod system which allows you to customize the your warframe firearms and melee weapons most mods are fairly generic offering things like increased reload speed or higher damage however some are more interesting being able to change the functionality of your abilities or say allowing you to replenish your energy when taking health damage which adds a considerable difference to playstyle you have your standard parkour system with wall running slides cliff hanging flips rolls and the like which combined with the weaponry and the individual abilities of each frame results in incredibly engaging immersive combat that supports a wide variety of playstyles altogether if youre looking for a third person shooter mmo with incredibly strong gameplay and a fairly pleasant aesthetic and dont mind a bit of repetitive grinding i recommend giving warframe a try

its unfortunate when a game with this much potential chooses to be crippled by all the standard freetoplay tropes in the name of profit everything you hate about free to play games is front and center in warframe an unenjoyable crippled experience if you dont buy ingame currency infinite grinding and farming and paytowin that makes your character and weapons twice as powerful if you dont play and farm 40 hours a week a special note needs to be made about the level of grinding in this game the game is literally nothing but farming and grinding there is nothing else in the game one of the central mechanics of the game is to level then relevel your character and weapons each time you completely relevel something in the game you gain a few more points to put towards the abilities of the character or weapon imagine if you played world of warcraft and upon reaching level cap you had the option to relevel your character from level 1 to level cap and the reward for doing so was you would gain half of an ability slot the game was fun but flawed until the recent combat 20 system was implemented in one patch digital extremes changed all weapons so that any weapon you choose is only effective against 13 of the enemies experience gain was cut by more than half and coincidentally the same patch also added the ability to purchase any abilities or mods you might need from other players using ingame currency to put it more pointedly the developers made weapons 13 as effective and not only did they not reduce the amount of grinding necessary to level those weapons they made levelling items and acquiring resources more than twice as difficult they simultaneously added an option to spend real money in order to buy whatever you may need from other players presumably in order to not be accused of having the game be blatantly paytowin if they sold the items directly as you can see i put over 700 hours into this game and there are some aspects that are were fun greed and hubris have finally overcome and outweighed the enjoyable aspects of this game if you enjoy paytowin farming grinding levelling then relevelling you character and weapons content that consists of running a few mission types infinitely and overpaying for virtual items and goods than warframe is probably the game for you

warframe is undeniably one of the most satisfying experiences ive had with a free to play title it contains an ever expanding arsenal of weapons mods and warframes that can be mixed and matched for endless possible combinations the game also features a highly satisfying clan system including the ability to build your own clan hall which provides several bonuses besides the simple meeting area with cosmetics and the great feature of warframe is that it always contains a challenge from raiding the orokin towers to hunting down the elusive stalker and harvester something is there to put your mettle to the test and in case it wasnt clear you play as freakin space ninjas whats not to love

so warframe a game where youre a space ninja fighting off stupid robot things while grinding like  to get upgrades and better weapons although the game can be fun at times it can get really repetitive really fast a lot of the missions are rehashes of other missions with minor changes to the layout or enemy placement and speaking of enemies the ai is not good in this game stealthing is very easy as the range of vision isnt far and they dont detect sound making it almost too easy also they dont seem to dodge too much and will only move side to side when getting shot at making them a little easy to hit the grinding is just hell you will spend hours upon hours just to unlock a new weapon or certain upgrades although this may seem fine at first glance it will get tedious as time goes on if youre into that then good for you but i for one am not the controls are a small complaint for me as they feel awkward and sometimes unresponsive at times some controls feel awkwardly placed and some take a lot of time to get used to some will argue that its a free game and that a lot of this stuff doesnt matter sure you think that but for me it just isnt a game that i took enjoyment in playing recent updates have added interesting things but not enough to keep me playing its an average game that has a lot of wasted potential and falls short with heavy grindfests at times awkward controls and heavy repetitiveness this game gets a 610 from me you may disagree and think this games really good and thats great you enjoy but i found no such enjoyment

pros nice graphics great variety of warframes and weapons and its free cons ninjas play free  more like mindless drones collecting resources so they can make better gear to collect more resources with play free even though the game is free to play there is only very little you cant buy with real money as in you can either spend 34 days depending on how much do you play farming for resources to get a new warframe character class and then spend another 23 days building it or you can just buy it for 20 dollars the game does everything in its power to make you throw money at it  want a pet you can either farm for an egg which can drop from dens present only on one planet usually found in quantities of 4 per mission then you have to farm for credits and resource obtainable only in special area accessible only with a key received from several missions as a random reward then you have to craft an item to even begin the breeding and then you have to wait 4 days before your pet matures or you can throw money at the game to bypass all this  but thats not all if you happen to not play the game for a while your pet will die because you have to feed it with item that costs quite a lot of credits there was also a new resource introduced some time ago which drops only from one enemy in the game that also happens to attempt suicide whenever he sees you to make you even angrier and drop money to bypass boring grind cash shop is incredibly overpriced  40 dollars for a discounted pack with three weapons out of which only one is good and a color palette weapons in that pack also have extremely small chance of dropping from a single enemy in the game who happens to be someone who can and more often than not will kill you before you even notice coincidence maybe those color palettes cost about 4 dollars each and there is about 10 in the store the game is focused on grinding and farming  if you want to play high level content you have to level up some gear and farm credits and resources to get your mastery rank up so you can then start farming resources for the good gun viable in high level missions so you can grind and farm even more to get even better weapons so you can grind all the mods and credits faster so you can repeat the whole process more effectively game is intentionally gear based  literally no amount of skill can help you if you dont have good gearmods bosses are just bullet sponges with the weakspot mechanic drop tables are diluted especially when new gear comes out games are hosted on players computers so expect heavy lag and common disconnects tldr if you enjoy doing the same boring and tedious thing over and over and over again this game is probably for you on the other hand if you dont like being ripped off by greedy developer you should look somewhere else

ninjas pay fees would be more appropriate lets be serious for a moment yes this game is no pvp oriented and yes you can get almost everything by grinding but this game is not only lacking any direction and making its developers look like the lovechild of ea bioware and ign the whole thing is made for you to feel frustrated enough to buy some stuff the moment you jump into it you will feel like there is almost no way to progress naturally you are stuck with a very underpowered loadout in the first three planets for a while you may think you are getting some nice loot until you realize you are not able to craft anything useful until later in the game when you can access the harder missions and once you complete the star map you will find little to no reason to play unless you want to get new stuff to painfully level up every single time you want to fully customize it not to mention the huge prices in the cash shop if you happen to consider skipping some of the content in this game that is grind to grind please let me make this clear once a game has monetization cash shop or the like is no longer beta it is just an incomplete released product using a buzzword to avoid criticism if you seriously want to play this game just be warned  you will have to grind for days or play with matchmaking which is almost a never newbiefriendly experience  you will need to be in a clan asap if you want some of the better gear to tackle the challenging content later in the game  you will be tempted from every front to spend real money in the game either by the poorly implemented trade system or the painful grind  if you happen to have some complaints you may find half of its community to be really hostile and blindly loyal also you will experience game breaking bugs in every major update while this is kind of expected the loyalists will dismiss all your complaints as gamer entitlement and thus slow down the process thanks to how developers take negative feedback into account in short a nice artistic concept completely botched by pure greed and lazyness

its an awesome concept but the game gets stale after the first 3040 hours of gameplay you find yourself collecting the same things in the same levels against the same 3 basic enemy types the only thing that changes as you level up is the variety of weaponry available and the number of enemies onscreen imagine me3s coop multiplayer mode turned into a giant standalone minus the variety thats warframe

warframe was a good game back in the day although the gameplay in general is solid and fun the payment model and new trading system have completely destroyed what little economy the game had with the addition of prime access those of us who dont have $250 to throw at a pack are stuck farming endlessly with no chance ever to recieve the exclusives that are in the highcost packs i have many hours in this game with 1500 before it was even on steam if you have money to throw and you dont mind being forcefully excluded from exclusive items because you cant afford it by all means try it out be warned though the trading system has created a severally unbalanced paytowin blackmarket among players

saying this game is free to play is a bold lie let me tell you the story of when i started this game you are only allowed to pick 1 of 3 starting classes or warframes out of the existing 10 or 15 so you play around and you want to make a weapon you can either 1 use ingame points to unlock a blueprint for the weapon if the weapon you want even has a blueprint farm the resources to make the weapon which can take a really really long time especially for a starting player after obtaining everything spend even more ingame credits to start the making of the weapon which takes 24 hours not joking wait an entire day and then you get to play with the weapon or 2 give warframe your money making warframes is even worse you have to fight the same boss over and over just hoping you get the right drops from it you need a chassis blueprint systems blueprint helmet blueprint and a warframe blueprint you need to build all those items before you can even begin making the warframe which all use ingame credits and takes 3 days to make or you can throw your money at warframe oh and you can only have 2 warframes out of the 15 to play with you only have 2 warframe slots and like 5 weapon slots you want more weapons or warframes looks like you have to spend some more money you need to give warframe more money so you can get more slots just to get more warframes and weapons lets talk gameplay the gameplay is fun sort of i enjoyed playing solo missions more than playing with 3 other strangers  why because if i play solo i can try using stealth which is impossible if your new teammates fly down the halls shooting everything in sight also if i play solo i can play at my own pace every single game that you play online with 4 people the game becomes less of a fps and more of a race actually thats a perfect description of what happens it becomes less of theres 2 guys over there ill sneak up on one and shoot the other in the head and more of run run run oh look an enemy oh hes dead run faster faster it turns into a clusterfk of color ill summarize all of this so basically this is microtransaction the game the only way to enjoy the game to its full extend is spending a lot of money and i mean a lot i would actually prefer it if you had to buy the game that way warframe wouldnt be a lie and you wouldnt have to deal with half the bullcrap in the game sadly even if they did that you would have to deal with the other half of the bullcrap like waiting 3 days to play with a warframe its just a stupid system and is just used to siphon more money from your wallet oh i forgot to mention you can spend real money to speed up the process _ so yea more ways of spending money great the game is fun ish if you can look passed all the crap which i cannot if you ignore the facts that you need to spend money to use more than 2 warframes spend money to use more than 5 weapons wait 3 days to use a new warframe wait 24 hours to use a new weapon how the game puts micro transaction after micro transaction in front of your face every single time you open the game oh if you stop playing for a day the next time you open the game you win a random reward which is always a discount on your next micro transaction then you might like this game i dont

tldr if you love rng or spending real money on ingame swag then youve come to the right placeif not then gtfo and never look back gameplaywise warframe is actually a great game but the really messed up rng ruins the hard work that the gameplay has done its so random in fact that ive encountered several scenarios wherein energy orbs are either a dime a dozen or harder to find than waldo in a carmen sandiego book now apply this to loot enemies currency and crafting materials that being said it isnt lost to me that the developers did this intentionally just so that it would be easier to entice players to use actual money to buy the ingame currency platinum or the other pay to win options available buy warframes weapons boosts and materials as opposed to farming them got a lot of money to bypass the crappy rng play this game got a lot of time to waste on the crappy rng play this game no money or time gtfo and avoid this like the plague edit if you want to play this game but also want to reduce the wild rngs relevance then i suggest that you keep logging in till you get the 75% discount to platinum then buy the 4300 platinum pack from the store for 50usd that much platinum is more than enough to get you started and then some and the value is great

okay so i am and was a fan of this game i sponsored it before the present day i have bought things in microtransactions as well supporting the games development that being said i am really tired of the game it is a paytowin fest despite what people will tell you while you play the game you can supposedly make all of the equipment in the game but the people that do devote their entire lives to the game essentially so yeah its that type of game like diablo 3 or wow or world of tanks or something anyways the game has enjoyable graphics and play style but at the end of the day it takes alot of effort to convince yourself that its worth it to be this competitive for a player vs enemy game but it is just not theres no excuse for the play to win finances of the game other developers like that of path of exile dont go that route for example the game also has absolutely wretched connectivity issues not only do you have to up your ports for the game but even after that point you will disconnect lose connection to host your friendsguildmates wont be able to stay connected or the engine tasks you to play alone i have been in hundreds of 4 player squads and we encountered an area where one of us couldnt stay connected in the game and it wasnt even predictable it would affect one of us then another the developers are also working their keisters off to bring the players more guns and warframes characters and stuff of that nature but do not fix the issues with the connection game mechanics glitches and etc they also nerf items that the previous dayweek you spend real mulah on essentially ripping off the players they depend on funding their development before their very eyes and alot of them put up with it which is sad a game is not supposed to be this unfun so i cant recommend it at this point

i want to like this game but cant the basic shooterfighting mechanics are great the artwork is great the level design is mostly great the random nature of the levels is great but the new player experience is terrible the ui and map provide terrible guidance about what to do or where to go especially after completing the main goals for the mission you finish the main goals and then spend an hour fruitlessly trying to figure out where the mission exit is with zero help from the map or ui i had to quit and retry the 2nd and 3rd mercury missions to get a different map entirely before being able to complete the 2nd mission i gave up on this game after wandering around fruitlessly in the 3rd mission after completing the mission goal a solid hour back and forth through the entire level vainly seeking the exit with zero map indicators this game is promising but the new player guidanceexperience is awful

great graphics and smooth gameplay did not like the method of grinding to upgrade gear or to craft new warframes when you initially sign up you have a choice but did not know that you are stuck with said choice found some groups to play in mostly just rush right to the end of the level as quickly as possible pulling mobs with them and making the ending a lot harder to survive as a new player playing in the starting zone of mars found myself in random pairings of groups where higher level and more advanced players were farming accused me of riding their coattails wellthere goes the community i think with some polishing on the grind and lowering of cost in the store this game would be better its an mmo so you are bound to run into an ahole every once in a while but my luck was nearly every time i did not play solo

i wanted to like this but couldnt the biggest thing that jumps out at you is that this isnt a game that has grind its a game that was built around grind as a primary design mechanic and overall purpose in the game i dont mean diablo or borderlands type grind but incredibly dull mindless painful grind where often the best option is very low level missions you can just tear apart with ease or to just leech away in public games while it has a number of nice concepts it unfortunately fails to execute them very well worst among those being the painfully grind centric and rng related progression mechanic rather limited variety of loot that feels more like resource gathering than loot collecting and the overall poor game balance although this is shaping up to be one of those infinite beta type games with a functioning cash shop as theres always various aspects marked as coming soon currently being redesigned or reredesigned with some of the changes forcing you to wonder if much thought went into them at all while others are seemingly focused on just looking cool rather than if it would be an enjoyable game mechanic the space ninjas thing is a marketing gimmick as stealth in the game is not a good option and only semifunctional in one of the mission types although if you play with others they always just charge in with guns blazing like space marines mob ai is inept they like to run in circles then often take cover while standing behind explosive barrels things that only cover their lower half or just right out in the open the parkour only sort of works some of the time the rest of the time it either doesnt trigger or slingshots you off at mach 10 warframe certainly has its fair share of bugs in general i have all too often had to abort a mission giving up all my item rewards because the door to the next area wouldnt open the last mob was stuck underground the next sequence didnt trigger or so on it might shape up to be a really good game at some point along the line should it ever get out of beta and they really sit down to figure out how to get everything to work together effectively although as it is right now i couldnt recommend this to anyone

fair warning before you read on april 6th 2015 1700 gmt 2 my account has been suspended httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid420707826 yes it could simply be the autobanbot going haywire especially since no email was sent regarding to this i just simply have no reason to try getting my account unlocked at this point anymore by the way it was indeed false positive   the oldtext this is a convoluted unconstructed messy review which i also kept updating from time to time whenever i felt to do so whether its due typofixes or there are some other things worth mentioning i mainly if not only used to play this game from time to as a warning for those who are planning to even make a slightest financial or any sort of investment into this game i was indeed one of the fools who funded this game early on and can only continue due a specific group of people who make this game actually playable or otherwise functional thank you very much for helping you know who you are   a summary warframe is a videogame in which immersion is the higher importance to everyone than the actual functionality arbitrary metaphoric summaryaddition its a game build on very good foundation soon right before steamrelease they they blew a small rockhill very close to the house which gave some major fractures  cracks to foundation the game still kept standing though even if the floor and walls got quite tilted despite the advices of the experts instead of adding reinforces for the foundation or even drastically rebuilding the whole game the foundations only were plastered with new paint from the inside as the time goes on and the house is being filled with more items and tenants the cracks are getting more and more wide there are already huge waterdamages and everything else related at the basement and its only getting worse main review the game is decent modernishthrowback to times of mainly phantasy star online and such collectathons generally refencing to any game in which you might genuiely want to collect everything because its actually fun without feeling like a forefullyrepeatedchore but this is very heavily dependable to ones style of playing the games too also theres a very unreal tournamentlike feeling  vibe with various guns sans gameplayutility interfaces and various other features being quite playerunfriendly more related text written at the bottom of this review but here is  are the main issues only guaranteed way of avoiding the extremely amplified no lootissues when no playerfault is evident is to simply not play this game at all that is simply the most important game and dealbreaking issue that digital extremes proudly  boastingly  bad kind of audacitly on purpose implemented into this game very early on  few weeks before the steamrelease especially when no one with actually better ideas had asked for one if they eventually fix this then i might recomment playing this game this game is simply that huge of a healthhazard generally speaking otherwise there are far better dungeon crawlinggames on market some with much better multiplayermodeimplementations too   random afterthoughtsnote its actually quite funny that originally this game started as a offlinesingleplayerproject read dark sector damned you will be if youre trying to experience this game as a soloplayer eg lateron especially on obvious multiplayergamemodes such as defence but then you also have obvious singleplayermissions such as spythis game  the developers  digital extremes seems simply being very indecisive and polishes neither of the modes its of course a very different story if you eventually will be able to pull the meta  powergaming  minmaxing moves alongside being extremely lucky not only lootwise but also whether the other randomnumberelementsgods are not in the mood of simply stalling you read this game has large number of instabilityissues alongside on purpose yes they did reply as intented inconsistencyissues alongside many of the players on purpose dont want you yes you potential payingcustomer player to reach that point howeverapparently also theres the fact that people who did want this game to be less carpaltunnelinducing  fingerkilling read requires unnessarily amount of clicking generally speakingbut mainly especially with highrateoffiresemiautoguns eg akbolto mainly get the reply of being free to use any tools to emulate turboautofire when asked why couldnt this be an implemented option both de and most of the mastercommunity simply says this takes away realism & immersion and sometimes they masters say you shouldnt even bother playing this game with your equipments eg like logitechg500mouse if youre not coding or savvy with other 3rdcustomfiddlings i personally simply dont know what to call this kind of behaviorsemihypocrisy a summary of the players youre mostly going to find its one of the worst embodiment of fyigm or simply fygm please use searchengine on those acronyms unless youre going to find a clan  guild who indeed are willful to help you play through the content theyd personally need to repeat especially the quests which youll need to do in order to unlock new frames unless you want to dish out 20$ and over for them youre going to as being repeat hit the multiplayerlocked content i did mention mention the clanexclusive equipments and frames didnt i worse thing being that this game extremely griefingfriendly  want to stealoff the missionaccomplishment creditrewards from rest of the team rush to the extraction point and flag the other players being afk once the extractiontime ends  want to make sure people in defencemission wont get their rewards if theyd want to continue keep your vote on fightcontinue until the very last second and then quickly click

this freely even when there would be overflow bonus points if you rush the extraction and get rest of the afkflagged thus they wont getting their creditrewards  spy & rescuemission avoid stealth bonus points if you bounced a teammate into alarmtriggeringthings with the available weaponry eg grenadajumo  bounce with tonkor or tennoabilities aka abilities  magic  capture rush & trigger the fleeingmode on target and let him escape of course you wont getting any rewards either but so wont the others either bonus points if they picked up a some rareloot which theyre not allowed to keep now  sabotage rush & hope that the rnggods activate the meltdowncountdown sequence youll have to avoid reaching extraction point too to make sure everyone fails  interceptionwell now this is getting just silly but you can deny enemies from spawning by keeping their spawndoor open near  right next to  on many of the capturepoints techinicaly griefing regardless i didnt mention that the game keeps a

with a combat system a blend of mass effect and resistance and graphics a generation ahead of most other free to play titles youd expect this game to be good and yes for a free to play game it is but its not as good as the games it steals sometimes shamelessly from its everywhere in the game from the sliver of a storyline that exists to the weapons to the combat mechanics its unoriginal and not as good as the sources warframe takes inspiration from now im all for taking a great concept from another game and making it even better but its never been better the combat system is directly comparative to mass effect and while warframe has tried to move away from it even the ui used to be a dead steal from mass effect but again not as good excellent for a free title perhaps but the developer of warframe does not exactly lack the funding to make original content and thats my main issue with warframe they cant its like making a ww2 game called medal of duty or call of honor and branding it as something unique when digital entertainment the developer release a patch it tends to break the game after 2  years and 15 major updates although an inspiring amount you would think they would be able to at least check their own code before unleashing it on the main audience but something always breaks usually in spectacular ways a patch goes live to rebalance a warframe class and it breaks the matchmaking system sending you into a singleplayer game and the online chat into a singleplayer experience as well how or why the coding for a warframe has anything to do with the ingame chat system nobody knows rebalancing the game usually goes the same way as patches usually it fails and often in spectacular ways no matter if its your class your weapons or the enemies you use them on of course there is a forum for suggestions but unless complaints are voiced in the hundreds or more it goes largely ignored but i digress warframe is at its core a good game an original idea it never was and dont let anyone fool you there but a good game especially for a free to play title it does have a healthy view of what an ingame cashshop should be like and you never need to look at it to enjoy any aspect of the game sadly it is managed by a team of people who does not understand coding or game designing properly to maintain their original vision of what warframe should have been there are flaws in this game that have been flaws since warframe went live but that have never been solved to the point where one might wonder if they lost the original sourcecode somewhere along the way play this on a casual level if you are into free to play titles but dont waste your money on it from a design point of view warframe was always a mess and 15 updates later it is only worse than where it started

due to support and not the game itself i have to give it a thumbs down for now the support is almost the worst i have ever had besides the first darkfall lastly be prepared to spend lots of real money if you want stuff in game the time it takes to gather materials and then wait on crafting times is unreasonable and they know it so what happens is you spend real money because after you have grinded for 100s of hours for much of the gear and waited days and weeks to craft it you get sick of the grind give in and pay real money to speed it up also the pricing of in game content is the highest i have ever seen in any game so in essence long grinds or pay money lots of money and bad support

if you are going online with friends this might be up your ally because matchmaking is just painful in this game a bunch of software on your pc even your internet provider might collide with this game and it can inhibit the player joining a game or volunteering as a host that is even worse when the host changes during a long pvemission and some partymembers are no longer compatible with the host they are lost to the group and they lost their loot perpetually grinding for new gear that or youll have to open your wallet this results in p2w pve with its repetitive missions and absent story mostly exists to get you equipped for pvp which on the other hand can only be beaten with a good non pug it might be fun if you have good collegues a very good connectivity and the best gear you can buy then the other players are just prey in pvp or a nuisance in pve this leads to the paradoxon that the l33t wouldnt team up with n00bs but wont get decent matches either because there is no satisfying matchmaking system i strongly recommend playing with ingamefriends then you might have fun not because of the game but regardless of the game

think about all of the fun you had back in 2013 i would expect people to argue back to a negative review but there are plenty of negative reviews now the game has turned into a grindfest game as theres future updates and patches to make this game become pretty much a grindfest game back in those good old days where you actually do missions cooperatively its not like that anymore now to summarize it is still a good game played but on the inside theres grinding and repetitive missions to make this community almost unbalanced its certainly not fair for new players or players who want to come back and play this game

this game has some great ideas that were executed poorly i better just make a list pros nice ai the enemy ai and friendly if you happen to be playing invasion is pretty good for the most part enemies take cover and will retreat if you get too close varied enemies enemies come in all shapes sizes and roles some are offensive while others are defensive or provide support decent visuals not the best looking game out but definitely not an eyesore crafting system a double edged sword  the crafting system can be a blessing and a curse all warframes and weapons must be crafted unless you are willing to spend real money buying them while this is a great idea the costs and production times make this game into a massive grind mods mods add functionaility and bonus stats to your warframe and weapons wonderful idea unique abilities every warframe has its own special abilities each has its own role abilities add variety to the game and keep it interesting loads of weapons every warframe is equipped with a primary a secondary and a melee weapon there are so many different types of weapons playstyle options this is one of the few games that allows for a stealthy approach as well as a gunsblazing approach cons bugs so many bugs go unpatched that are reported the devs obviously dont care about the players endless grind the main reason to hate this game to do anything fun it takes hours and lots of patience terrible trading in order to trade you need to use a trading post which has a lot of prerequisites to build it will be a while before you have your own obnoxious wait times in order to build a warframe you need to find the blueprints for the three parts spend resources you probably dont have on hand buy the main blueprint after the parts are completed and wait 3 days for your new warframe this is complete garbage weapons take 12 hours rooms in the dojo take hours as well and so does destroying a room limited color selection in appearance panel sure its nice having the ability to color swap weapons and warframes and it is a good idea to limit the free colors but the selection available is too limited conclusion this game has some nice features and ideas but the devs have a lot to fix before i can consider this game worth a shot again after bugging through walls and having to restart boss missions because they glitch out i am done wasting my time

warframe has great graphics good controls for doing lots of parkour heaps of levels and tons of  to find these things make it one of the best free to play games ive ever played although it trys to prromote teamworkbut finding a group is can be a nightmare sometimes and then once you do there is hardly any coordination communication or teamwork involved it seems that you just go with other players to finish harder levels because their really hard solo there is also an extreme variety of warframes each with its own play style and powers and lots of weapons with different stats however almot all of these require premium credits which can almost never be found in the actual game which makes it all seem pay2win and then buying the blueprints requires you to spend hours searching planets for all the parts and then extra time to actually craft the item

after the general fun of the combat wore off i started dedicating a lot of time to minmaxing my warframe and sentinel with mods  however the developers repeatedly changed the game mechanics stamina change frames and sentinels sharing mods change in ways that screwed me over or left me far behind in progress from where i was right before the game update now that the game is a stable release this may not be a problem anymore but it left a strong sour taste in my mouth even with this fact aside it takes an extraordinary amount of time and luck to get better gearitems in many games you get small stat increases at relatively frequent intervals or relatively frequent gear drops although i think the weapons are supposed to be sidegrades the expensive and highrank weapons are much better albeit somewhat more situational than the defaults it takes a lot of materials to build weapons and a lot of luck to get certain blueprint parts to drop from missions these add up to a very grindy game with very slow progression

the game is great ive spent several hours in it but jesus christ the grinding is way too much it becomes repetitive over a while i got to a point where i literally could not stand it the character designs are very good the environment desings as well its a very nice game for a ftp but i would not recommend unless the devs give you something do do ingame  plotwise besides grinding on levels that look exactly all the same i still have hope for it

this game is a highly addicting game as you progress onwards into the game this f2p game becomes more and more p2p with the fact that you will realize that you do not want to spend another week farming the same one type of enemy boss or mission to get that item that you want it becomes very repetitive very fast if you like losing money and wasting your time or love grinding for 8 hours every day for 3 weeks just to get one upgrade part or item then this game is for you if you are not a crazy person who wants to play this game then here are some other suggested factors that will soon come into play once you embark on this horrific adventure  you will start to loose free time in your day you will start paying for a f2p game  you start to shrug off friends to play a computer game you start to become an isolationist  you start getting in arguments with your wife you get a divorce with your wife you skip your court date to ensure that you get to ever see your kids  you block out all interactions with the outside world you forget to pay your bills  you loose your car  you forget to pay for your house loan  you loose your house  you then revert to public libraries and coffe shops to set up your computer in  you get kicked out of coffe shops and libraries  you still go back to coffe shop and libraries  you get your computer confiscated you then sleep out side inside a tree hut  you think you are a space ninja and practice jumping and running from tree to tree  you fall and break your legs  you goto hospital  you sneak on hospital computer during the night to play warframe  you are then sedated by security gaurd  you wake up in jail  you remember that you couldnt pay medical bills  you cant resist the urge to play warframe so you try to escape from jail as a space ninja  a man on meth helps you escape  you get out and then buy meth from that man  you are now addicted to meth  you think you are a real space ninja  you jump from car to car  you then jump from bridge to car  you are on meth so you dont realize that the car is moving  you get hit by the car  you loose all limbs  you cant play warframe or be a space ninja  you revert to eating dirt to stay alive  you then get  on by a homeless man who is on meth  you realize that you are now below a man that is on meth  a giant eagle picks you up  you are then carried to the eagles nest  you then are eaten alive  then you are puked back up by the eagle  you then are given to the baby eagles as food dont be a limbless man who has had their life ruined by warframe uninstall or delete all traces of warframe now and save your self before the meth kicks in

pros  fun gameplay for a while  good graphics cons  seeing the same levels gets boring after a while  grinding fest to get new weapons to get grinding  try to rank up once per day  devs give absolutely no  if players have fun playing as long as theyre wallets get fatter you can craft weapons or warframes but it will take 12  72 hours to finish crafting or you can pay to boost it if you ever get the items for it you dont well pay to get better drops pay for this pay for that

i want to recommend this game i really do i just cannot in good faith recommend something that has all the right components but willfully chooses to put them together so badly that it becomes unplayable without spending enormous amounts of cash what am i complaining about free to play mentality let me start by saying this warframe can be really fun with its coop play procedurally generated levels different game modes and huge range of weaponswarframemod options it certainly possesses the qualities that one looks for in an engaging and fun game unfortunately you can and will find yourself completely unable to progress or enjoy any of the fun features unless youre willing to spend real world money and heres why what bad developers do when it comes to f2p games is carefully design the games so that they are unwinnable for players who dont spend real world cash on the game the players get hooked then frustrated and then either ragequit or spend lots of money so that they have a chance to win this strategy works but is incredibly scummy and in no way deserves to be supported warframe performs this on many levels and has definitely lost my respect because of it to begin with the game starts you off with basic storyline missions which are fairly straightforward easy fun and more or less teach you how to play thats fine in fact they even let you choose your starting weapon and warframe which is great customization right off the bat it also works great for you in the first dozen or so missions until the questline is over just enough time to get you hooked into the game then comes the stick several missions in you will learn that this innocent weaponwarframe selection is one in which you can actually make a bad choice which essentially cripples you for every mission going forward at least until you get a new warframeweapon combo see the game doesnt ramp up the difficulty it just ramps up enemy hp and damage and the annoying hacking minigames and does so completely irrespective of the levels that it claims to be designed around this quickly leads to you getting out of your league in nearly every single mission most of which are required to be completed in order to unlock the new content essentially content progression works like this want a new warframe you can buy the blueprint for an ungodly amount of credits which are essentially game currency oh wait you mean you want to play with the warframe no no you need to build all of the warframe parts first how do you do that thanks for asking the game wont tell you but youll learn from other players that you basically have to do special boss missions a million times to find the blueprints for the warframes components blueprints which by the way also have huge credit and resource costs associated with them oh the resources you farm those from planets which you unlock from doing higher level missions and beating bosses what do you mean you cant beat the higher level missions solo oh you have a terrible warframeweapon combo well get a new warframeweapon then see how it loops back in on itself youre too weak to do the missions on your own so you try to get new weapons or warframes thats when you learn that you dont have the resources to build the new weaponsframes even when you do have the huge amounts of credits required the resources require planets you dont have access to the planets require missions you cant beat theres only two ways out of this loop of stupid and the first involves spending a huge quantity of real world cash to bypass the games requirements platinum real world cash gets you basically everything in this game from rush building items that would otherwise take literal days to build to buying weapons and warframes outright without having to collect a single resource to buying all of the rare and valuable mods or whatever from other players who spent the time to actually earn them its clear the developers knew exactly what they were doing when they made the missions impossible for new players they were creating a cash trap the second way of getting resources involves piggybacking this is technically an mmofps so that means theres other players around now you can go on the main chat and beg higher level players to let you tag along on their missions which is a decent way of earning the credits and resources required for doing literally anything in the game only problem is that youre then stuck following uber players around as they play the game and you watch you literally cannot harm the high level guys they are fighting and you die in one hit so youre more or less forced to trudge through mission after mission waching other people play in the hopes that someday youll be allowed to join in this is not fun this is not gameplay this is boring and frustrating and is the equivalent of being on an olympic sports team and being asked to follow the team around with a camera instead of playing wait i hear you ask what about players who are your level well speaking from an oceania perspective those dont even exist i cant tell you how many times ive sat waiting on a mission screen for someone anyone to come join me nobody does thats because theyre all busy piggybacking with high level players since the games progression is broken and moneybased in other words forget matchmaking even if you did find people your level youd probably also find that they were too weak to help much or a hindrance in the several missions which require stealth i wont even get into the terrible mechanics of stealth here but just know that its like assassins creed 1 if your assassin was a shopping trolley and enemies possessed the eye of sauron since once they see you they will never not be able to see you the bottom line is that warframe has so many tantalizing and interesting options which it then locks away in a gilded cage and tells you that you either need to pay for them with endless hours of your life or with real world money the irony is that i was willing to actually spend money on this game until i saw how badly they mistreat their nonpaying players and i just didnt want to be a part of that kind of system so ill be keeping my money and the hours of my life id otherwise have wasted on this game and investing both in something more productive and less horrifyigly abusive to its playerbase

when i first started playing this game it was really fun but once i progressed farther into the game it becaume rediculously repetative i felt like i was playing the same 5 maps over and over if there were more maps or even a different map for each level it would make the game much more amusing everything you can buy ingame is way to expensive the only point of the game is what exactly it seems all there is to do is grind to get a socalled better weapon but it sucks get another 40000 ingame credits and buy another  weapon not to mention the upgrading system
