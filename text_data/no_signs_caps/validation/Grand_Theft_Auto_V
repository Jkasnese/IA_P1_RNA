game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

grand theft auto v is an amazing game but changing the game price to 7999 before the steam summer sale and discounting it at 25% puts it back at 5999 they also throw in a free shark card        what the actual  rockstar

rockstar needs to learn how to fill their open worlds up with things to do especially in the collectibles department the skill system just plain sucks as well the story is interesting and the world is beautiful but the gameplay is dull and boring the saints row games are so much more fun the multiplayer is a travesty overall gta v is horribly overrated

first of all rockstar is not banning for single player mods theyve now stated this outright i mean seriously when did we start believing people who were banned just because they say theyre innocent 90% of these new negative reviews are unfounded and outright lies not only that but they have no changed the eula either if you have a dll injector installed in your game directory it doesnt magically stop working when you go online just because you dont use it its still there your own fault like seriously when did people get dumb enough to think an anti cheat wouldnt pick up dll injectors dll injectors are the most common way hacks exist headdesks there are two groups of people  actual cheaters who got banned from online for cheating using the scripthook and trainer dll injection and then theres people who only used it in single player but left it installed when they went online newsflash  its still there its still injected into the games memory in any case the game is great theres a few speed bumps and quirks here and there that need to be worked out as with any game so soon after launch but overall it performs great online is fun and you can mod single player not really a lot more you can ask for amirite 910 because i dont believe in perfect scores ps stop being idiots edit in light of a few ignorant jackasses heres the proof httpwwwrockstargamescomnewswire im having soo much fun with gtav on the pc but i just have one question about it how come you are not allowing mods for it  @clarkmatthew63 will i get banned from gta online for using a fov mod or oculus rift mod  @mattophobia we have always appreciated the creative efforts of the pc modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original gta map mod for gtaiv pc among many other classics to be clear the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for gtaiv recent updates to gtav pc had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications this was not intentional no one has been banned for using single player modifications  and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player pc mods our primary focus is on protecting gta online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage disrupt gameplay or cause griefing it also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized they may be broken by technical updates cause instability or affect your game in other unforeseen ways but by all means  lets just believe the banned people because they said they didnt do it its not like cheaters to lie about it or anything

i would have recommended this game until rockstar pulled their latest stunt as part of the summer sale bundling the game with a card for ingame currency then marking it up just so the sale price is the same as the regular game technically not illegal theyve officially proven that they care more about raking in money and screwing over their fanbase than drawing in new fans deceptive sleasy marketing at its scummiest

dont get the game for online until rockstar adds some sort of serious anticheat the online portion is absolutely ruined if your looking for a open world game with an interesting single player story or private multiplayer with friends then this is for you but if your looking for some drop in and have some open world fun with 30 players expect to be abruptly blown up gain millions in cash lose said millions in cash gain guns you never bought lose said guns you never bought and then have your car deleted all from users playing with trainers rockstar cares about your cash not your experience in the game dont buy it for half the game buy it for the full game when they actually make half the game playable  updates to issues that plague half the game 7112015 update to trainers players using scripts and what not can now go invisible and hide themselves from others entirely add that onto the ability to launch others into the air at a whim or having molitovs explode on them as well as exploding the only thing actively being gaurded right now is the money and thats still being shot out from miniguns or simply dropped onto players heads to gather information if you wish to report a player the best option is to find a tv ingame and use spectate to report a player that is invisible they can still be seen even if their husk isnt visible httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid479685669 6162015 update to so called anticheat the script creators already found an easy workaround around the brief scan its stopped all money drops long term because they are monitoring it a bit more heavily but they can do everything else in between still im still suggesting anyone to really think about getting the game 6102015 update to the trainer issue the issue still persists to this date but is now raised to where users of said trainers are targeting players calling out users and reporting players using trainers to rockstar they can remove the bans placed against them they can remove all ingame reports on them theyve ruined online i implore you to reconsider at all costs as to buying gta 5 for online they have so much power in online and rockstar is not showing any hint of helping out the common player on gta besides for giving us cash for the carsammoguns we have lost and saying sorry for your inconvenience perhaps theyve forgotten who makes their games so popular  tldr online portion ruined by trainers single player is absolutely amazing if you like the gta series and good characters

i know rockstar have had a thing against pc gamers for a while now i was willing to put the beef aside when i purchased this game it was cool rockstar i didnt mind waiting for the release of gtav even when it was delayed 8732198 times i didnt mind that you said no to mods on gtav even though in my opinion it would make the game a lot more enjoyable for a lot of us and possibly make us buy future rockstar games one thing i do not like though is raising the price of the game right before the steam sale so the game is still available for the full retail price even at a 25% discount that is a scumbag thing to do and you will never get another penny from me or anymore play time on any of your games i know a lot of pc gamers are annoyed with you about this so hopefully all of this negative feedback will have an impact on your company you done t up rockstar have a nice day

gta 5 finally arrives on pc after a long delay but the big question is was it worth the wait if you havent played gta on previous and current gen consoles then this you will definitely want to get it the campaign on its own is totally worth the price and with all the stranger missions you will be occupied for some time however the multiplayer is what will keep you coming back to the game for more rockstars main focus postrelease is on gta online and with their regular release of free updates theres always something new for players to try out for any beginners to gta online heres a handy and short guide with all the need to know httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqd4ilq_rrs moving onto performance which is one of the reasons why gta was delayed so much for pc there doesnt actually seem to be any major problems with running it because the game was made with ps3xbox 360 in mind the required specs arent amazingly high obviously if you want to be running it in all its glory and at high resolutions then you will need better equipment

this game is great until you go to play online it takes waaay to long to load online close to 5 minutes on a high end pc like mine and once you get there it is miserable to play nearly every session i have joined the past 2 weeks has at least one hacker either giving everyone money or just running around with invincibility killing everyone what finally pushed me over the edge is when i was playing online with a friend doing our own thing and then all of a sudden everyone on the server dies because they are crushed by falling rocks then there is a clone of the character stuck to my body and even after killing it and myself it just stayed it only gets worse my friend and i didnt mind it to much and it was a bit comical at times but then we are all killed again except this time blown up which destroyed my car that i had to make the claim on and drained all cash and removed all guns about 30 seconds after that it was flooded literally i did what a responsible person would do and reported the hacker as i have to most of the other hackers that i pass by and what does rockstar do nothing absolutely &%$ing nothing to the point where i saw the same hacker a week later doing the same thing in a different server it has gotten to the point where i dont even bother playing online anymore because you simply cant tldr version rockstar needs to get it together with banning hackers and until then do not buy this game if you plan on playing online or it will be miserable for you

hey guys i dont usually write reviews but grand theft auto v is a game that is absolutely worth it a game that breaked most impressive records of guiness book bestselling actionadventure video game in 24 hours 12 milion copies bestselling video game in 24 hours 564 milion$ fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion fastest video game to gross $1 billion highestgrossing video game in 24 hours highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours including hollywood movies most viewed trailer for an actionadventure video game most viewed trailer of an actionadventure videogame 800 milion views graphics 1 graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible the game runs smooth on any kind of gpus and cpus as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements by the way these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details 2 graphic details are the best i have seen especially in an openworld game if i was to tell you all about this topic i would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours because boy there are lots to talk about im just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me a daynight cycle recreation sure this is not something new in its essence it has been done before and not just in gta but the way we see it here its whats amazing the way the light shifts from one period of the day to another its off the charts you dont even realize when the afternoon becomes evening the only way you can tell its that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you b rain again not a new feature actually is quite an old one but the way its been reproduced in gtav  you can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact apart from the obvious what makes rain so special in gtav  well the sound  this is something that not many people talk about yet is one of the breathtaking features of the gamethe way rockstar games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain besides everything else c night time baby sure we had night in gta iv and even before that so why do i mention this  well because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows i am not talking just about the graphics aspect what im saying is that the night in gtav gives you the impression of actual liveliness the whole city comes to life its just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever 3 cars are the best looking and are way ahead those weve seen in previous gtas im not talking about a direct comparison because of the obvious reason 20152010 but what im trying to say is that i personally wasnt that impressed at the time by the carshelisplanes in gta4 as i am now in gtav gameplay and features oh yea the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for gtav to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come 1 car control i feel like thanking rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter car control was preety much garbage in gta iv and for this reason alone i had no big expectations for this new series well i was wrong the car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing nfs mw back in the day besides the control there is the sound of the cars engine which is perfectly accurate 2 randomness now what in gods name im talking about well have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help  a womans that was about to get  a kid whos bike was stolen hitchhiker asking you to take herhim home etc usually for a reward if you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal but baby this stuff gives gtav a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game 3 los santos customs again not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special have you tried modifying the cars suspension of course you did what am i saying but have you actually paid attention of its realism after the change was made well for those who havent and for the ones who dont own the game yet let me tell you that this feature is gamemaking my favorite car in gtav is the grotti carbonizzare also known as the ferarri f12 now think how am i gonna drive that beast on the citys roads especially in areas like groove hilwood rockford these are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads so you cant really drive a ferarri in these parts of the town well you can modifying the suspension to a higher state doesnt just make for visual effects but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads turns hard turns btw if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings for me this is one of the best things ive seen in this game 4 activities driving mission making robberies flying hunting diving piloting aircrafts submarines boats golf tennis cards smoke weed racing playing the stock market you will never get bored in this game not even in single player mode there are so many more things to talk about but the review would be monstruosly long so in a few words buy the game it will be the best investment you have done in a pc game for those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom i can tell you in short that this game excels in every aspect weapons look so realistic in first person mode cars have a mind blowing realistic control weather has never been better reproduced etc gl&hf

the single player game is rather good but the online game is just unplayable 1 countless bugs when you do a heist there is about a 50% chance that you cannot finish it because of a bug i am not even kidding that means if you spend 2 hours on a heist you are only actually playing the real game for 1 hour as most of these bugs require a restart of the game 2 crashes random crashes occur all the time not only that but some crashes are so terrible that it requires you to reinstall the game one friend of mine has reinstalled the game more than 10 times now i am yet again not kidding more than 10 times he needed to download the entire game again which is about 60gb each time 3 glitches the only thing in the online game that is important is money you can buy money from the store of the game but that is never needed there are multiple glitches and hacks which can make you a millionaire from doing nothing that is destroying the gameplay a lot and the programming level of this game to make these hacks possible is just terribly low i am a programmer myself and i am shocked that rockstar games managed to do this 4 online in a random game is just terrible gameplay if you are in a car which you most likely are people will just one hit you with an rpg or a homing launcher these players then have to pay a fine for your car if it was insured which it most likely is that means that they have to pay for the missile shot $1500 and then the car $6000 but they do not care and think that they have won the battle even if they payed for it this either means that people are just not smart enough in this game to understand that what they do actually makes them lose a lot of money or that those players are using the glitches to have unlimited money and can therefore just waste money to win in pvp that means that money is much greater than skill in this game 5 heists apart from all the bugs finding people to go to a heist with is just horrible most people cant even speak or type in english this makes it impossible to finish a heist with random people you have to use external websites to find a heist team and even then its hard to find people that can actually finish a heist about 5% chance to win a heist each try hours and hours doing the same thing over and over even if you finish all heists in a row or without dying at all there are bugs that removes the additional money given for achievements this means that you can spend around 10 hours doing an achievement and then when you should get $10 000 000 for it you just get nothing i always wanted to work at rockstar games but now i feel that i have nothing to learn from them how can they fail so miserably making a game that works with that much money

storymode is good its just not worth $60 rockstar doesnt give a flying  about gta online however it is now flooded with hackers that will not get banned for the next month money is increasingly harder to get with every update requiring a long grinding of heists to get what you want also good luck finding friendly people to play with free roam is basically a massive deathmatch  hole rockstar is antifun when it comes to online it seems that they only want people to buy overpriced ingame money that they call shark cards want a fighter jet and an attack chopper than can be instantly shot out of the sky with cheap homing rockets you would have to pay $100 with real money to get the equivalent cost for them or you could spend 150 hours grinding heists to get the money for them rockstar is removing fun harmless glitches that would have been better off staying for example you used to be able to open the back door of the cargo plane by punching it allowing you to store cars inside you can open the cargo plane in storymode but you cant in online for some reason they patched this glitch you used to be able to wear a hat  mask together through a glitch involving bike helmets allowing for some pretty cool combinations like gas mask  military helmet its completely harmless this was patched in the most recent update there used to be a fun physics glitch where you could launch a car into the sky with some careful positioning known as the gate glitch it was fixed as well and now theres this whole thing about raising the price for the summer sale for me rockstar is now in the same category as ea activision and ubisoft

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles

used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didnt want to make it look like a sale should have never went on sale or pretended to i dont think the game costs 80$ edit let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about this was posted when r was doing their shady steam sale promotion at the beginning you couldnt buy gta v alone at its regular price of $5999 you could buy it at the same price but with its in game money card which was the only way to buy it unless you wanted gta san andreas or max payne so if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some googling about what happened if they hadnt put it on sale gta v could only be bought at $8499 so it was a fake sale

rockstar let me explain to everyone how did you came up with such a wonderful idea so there is a pool on rockstar laboratories on that same pool there is a bunch of manatees swimming around picking up small balls which inside of them contains the next fantastic and brilliant marketing strategy that rockstar should use this is the next level in terms of marketing rockstar have been using this method for few years now that everyone knows well done rockstar and  you too thats what you said to your players by having this wonderful idea

wow too bad i bought this game already i will never ever buy a game from rockstar anymore since they changed the price before summer sale game is good but well i am done with you rockstar

the game is great but i fell its my gaming duty to give a huge thumbs down because of all the summer sale shenanigans really rockstar and valve raise the games price one day before the sale so you guys can give a nonexistent discount do you guys think your customers are stupid

havent had this much fun in years t_t 3 gta vice city and san andreas will remain rockstar classic games forever but this one is the revolutionary ultimate of the gta franchise so far whether you play alone with 1 friend coop public etc you will definitely find something to love about this game with its huge variety of activities driving stunting flying shooting minigames racing and a whole lot more inside a beautiful & large map

jacking the price up during steam summer sale and then puting a 25% discount on it to make it look like it is on sale  absolutely ridiculous and am totally looking into the legality of this
not recommended
i cant recommend this right now because of the scummy business practices that rockstar are currently employing as you have probably read it is impossible to get a real discount on the game as they have decided to instead bunch it together with a shark card leaving the game with no real discount not only does mean that the game isnt really on a discount it also means that you probably wont be able to refund it in case something goes wrong or if you change your mind because of the unrefundable micro transaction along with it i preorded this game before it came out but for players who do not currently own it and are considering it i would probably wait until this is over hopefully rockstar will see how angry the steam community is about this and sort it out until then i would suggest waiting the game itself is enjoyable for the most however but i cant suggest it until rockstar sort this out

problems with grand theft auto v for pc  raising the price just before the summer sale to $75 usd so rockstar can make a few more bucks seriously this is one of the most despicable buisness moves ive ever seen a major game company do rockstar is now actually worse than ea  the online hacker problem is out of control with nearly every online game having a hacker and rockstar seem to be more interested in pushing shark card sales than dealing with the hackers  the new dlc is ridiculously overpriced encouraging players to pay almost $2 million for a supercar that isnt even as fast as the previous dlc supercars in an effort to again push shark card sales  the heists were ridicilously delayed and now that theyre out theyre such a letdown with only 5 heists avaliable and only 2 being heists the rest just being normal missions with a larger payout  rockstar only care about patching money glitches and making overpriced dlc rather than fixing the very large amount of blantant problems and glitches the game has most being from the console version in conclusion as fun as gta v is i do not recommend this game in its current state and highly advise potential customers to hold out until these issues are addressed and dealt with

honest review review is based on current state of game game pros open world  in depth character customization  passive mode option so players cant kill you online  long intricate story line single player  heists online  weather system  multiplayer  vehicles groundair  buyable houses  daynight cycle  mini games  grouping system  pvp game cons hackersscripters  ability to use real money to buy ingame money  you can randomly get disconnected from the server relateable games na conclusion grand theft auto v is beautifully crafted with such a big game there is bound to be issues but nothing that breaks your fun create your own gang in the rockstar social club website and start making your mark if you found this review helpful consider giving it a thumbs up looking for more steam friends feel free to add me

rockstar had already lost all respect in my eyes due to putting console sales in front of pc sales it was quite clear that console users rack up more money and that is exactely why rockstar decided to wait 15 years for the pc release this company doesnt care about the players anymore for example gta online is becoming a disaster the modders totally ruin the game you can find a hacker in every single session you join before it was a bit better now due to the absence of any anticheat the modders just roam the map and decide to ruin everyones game experience rockstar doesnt seem to care at all dont get me started on the loading times joining or hosting a missionheist may take up to 10 minutes leaving the game takes time getting into the game takes even more time sometimes the game just fails to connect to online and puts you automatically into single player which is ridiculous and takes more time they shouldve really made something like samp was  offer independent servers to be rented out so that people can choose which gamemode to play well you may check my game hours and say that i am full of crap i bought this game for online i tolerated the loading times and the littletonone hackers in the beginning of the pc release now i have understood that online is overhyped and quite boring plus with hackers it is impossible to enjoy freemode as i constantly have to put on passive mode to prevent getting killed instantly by an atomic bomb or whatever hacks these guys have if you really like gta francise buy the game after the summer sale as rockstar decided to grab even more money before they leave this game if you dont want to cope with the problems this game currently has wait for a bit maybe in 3 months they have put a anticheat system into online and fixed the loading times maybe

great game truly amazing compared to full priced garbage these days free dlc and more i am very happy but not surprised that the game runs so well most likely because its a parallel developed pc game and not a lousy port the missions in this game are extremely fun the heists and the story is very interesting surrounding these three men i did not skip a single cutscene the online portion of this game feels like an mmorpg you level up gain money and buy transport weapons clothes and your very own apartment rockstar is constantly developing content for online and so far the best update for gtao that has ever come out is the online heists well online freemode with randoms feels like world war 3 so i suggest you play on invite only lobbies until you get a decent level modding is supported by rockstar which is great but keep it outside of online of you dont want to get banned dll injectors and such stay away from them since theyre classified as cheats only mod offline i know i didnt review this game like angryjoe however you dont really need me to tell you how great the game and the pc version is totally worth the wait

f u rockstar evil pos of company raising the price of the game and finding a loop hole in the refund policy by auto activing the sharkcard so if someone didnt like the game or they couldnt run it they could not get a refund i owned the game before the summersale but seeing this company will rip off customers to make a buck your marketing team and ceos are now a pos

the sale of the game isnt actually a sale it adds a worthless piece of in game money on top which can only be used in gtao not only does this mean that you dont actually get the game for any cheaper it also nullifies your ability to get a refund as the shark card money is redeemed instantly it isnt even much money

if you thought you were going to get a gta optimized for pc forget it rockstar once again is doing everything in their power to stop single player mods and 3rd party patches despite all of the aspects where the game is lacking edit the resilience of the modding community may overwhelm even rs stubborness but only time will tell thanks to some very special modders some singleplayer script based mods are working as of 56 if you do decide to get gta despite the warnings of my fellow reviewers be very careful when using any type of mod

from the start rockstar is being a bunch of  about this first of all at launch the process in which i must download the gta drivers is very confusing and not helpful at all plus the drivers arent even that much of a help because its only a minor difference doesnt run well on hd 7970 also they sell this two year old game for $70cad on launch and dont put it on any real sale for steam summer sale gta online is ing filled with hackers and paytowin  that ruins the fun of it after 200 hours it doesnt have that much more attention from me as the multiplayer is just stepped on by rockstar and the community

i bought this game for its multiplayer online and because friends wanted me to play wouldnt you know when i got on the game you would be instantly kiled by a group of 3 who want to ruin your fun in an indestructable vehicle rockstar then allowed modding of the game jump right into an online game some guy goes around the map at lightning speed and shotguns you in the face go into passive mode its a way to stop you from getting killed by players but if you bump into a cop while in passive mode they will kill you and you cant do anything but run want money grind your heart out or buy 200k for 5 dollars and so on up to 100 doallrs giving you over 10mil if not 100mil so you got this pay to ruin someone else gaming experience but when someone wants to get money to buy cool cars and drive around the npc infested highways they get banned cool cool i wouldnt recommend this game if you wanna have a good online experience my opinion my thoughts do what you want with it

great game best gta game of all time however there are a few things that bother me about gat v the price first off itss a great game and has sold tons of copies all over the world but give me a break rockstar this game launched back in like november 2014 so im wondering if the pc users will ever see the price drop down even for a weekend special or so that is one of the main reasons that all of my friends playing console wont make the switch to pcthe price another thing that bothers me is the fact that the game is stuck in one hugh 60 gb install which makes it impossible to add mods to the single player aspect of the game  so if your a good sport like me and dont want to add cheats to the game then your just screwed beware most pc players will use trainers and cheat while online and rockstar offically dont care do not buy this game to play online you will be very dissapointed if you dont like online hacks and cheaters beware other then the price and the fact that nearly everyone cheats online this is a decent game to enjoy

i was waiting to buy this game the hype surrounding it was fully supported by gameplay i was ready to buy this in the summer sale and i still did however this business practice is horrible granted the game is worth the full $60 and paying $60 for it plus bonuses is wonderful the fact that there is no base game available makes this nothing other than a cash grab they may still surpise us yet with 9 days left in the sale lets hope

game is great company can suck my  httpgyazocom40691afd0c3f8c7b791b5a7eea55c53d blue bar indicates a major price bump the day before the sale that effectively negates the effect of the 25% discount i mean how the  did you think this was okay in any way its times like these when i wished there were hitmen that didnt kill people they just walk up and punch people in the throat and just yell no poopface why you should not buy this game right now  within the discounted game they bundled a micro transaction which means you cannot get a refund no matter how much you regret the purchase  rockstar is being a bunch of asshats and need to realize their mistake although they are probably so far up their asses so they wont  the micro transaction itself in game money in online play is pretty much useless the only thing youll get is probably a somewhat fancy car and a pinch of regret

april 14 day when i quit my job april 14 day when gta 5 was released for real xd april 14 day when i stop having xxx <3 with my wife couse game have so much thrill  ok now about review  grand theft auto v is a spectacular third person free roaming game which does well in portraying everyones guilty pleasures whether that is slaughtering innocents exploding cop cars with rpgs murdering hookers or taking a trip to the local strip club grand theft auto has always been amongst the greatest freeroam shooters of all time and it continues that legacy here with gta v the online experience and racing have been greatly improved and the story features three playable protagonists rather than the traditional one in the story of grand theft auto v you play as three very different characters with three different distinctive personalities first is michael a retiree from the illegitimate business of bank robbing and a family man with tons of family problems next is the young blood franklin straight outta the hood and looking to make a living without having to look over his shoulder every step of the way lastly is trevor the truly psychotic man with no regards for human life everyone that plays gta v instinctively chooses a favorite character whether it is michael because you want to see him get his family back on track franklin because you want to see him create a future for himself or trevor because you too enjoy killing drunken rednecks regardless you must play as all three and the greatest feature that separates the campaign of grand theft auto v from all others is the bank heists plan and execute heists whether you choose stealthy or an all out blood bath choose your crew which ultimately decides the payout you receive from each heist and enjoy every detail and heist you can the story is well worth the price of buying the game but it comes with an added bonus gta online although gta online had a rocky start with several issues it is for the most part fixed today and a very fun experience to play with friends in the beginning their were terrible servers problems involving created characters being deleted and now the mission payouts being much lower than early release and replaying them pays out even less along with most others i am still awaiting for heists in multiplayer which very well may never come but regardless gta online is still fun you still have the ability to run around and kill others as well as civilians but instead of that simplicity you can now customize your character his vehicles and even where he lives you earn money through online missions and other methods that helps you pay for newer vehicles apartments weapons and clothes you create your own character and literally choose his skills which you can later improve grand theft auto always has great replay value gamers still play san andreas and gta iv and of course several thousand still play gta v after the story is over you can always free roam and when you get tired of wandering aimlessly the multiplayer is great to play for long periods of time gain satisfaction improving your vehicles and purchasing a high end apartment i only have one little note about this game not for kids seriously if you are even the least bit immature or offended by violence language or sexual content please do not buy this game and dont buy it for kids either a great game but its worth waiting for especially if it will traumatize you or turn you from innocent into a kid that spews foul language overall a masterpiece rating 9610 visual rating 1010 audio rating 1010 story rating 1010 playability rating 1010 replay value 9510 multiplayer 810 written by golden members  epic gunner and zemunbre please do subscribe if you liked this review there will be more to come

my review of rockstar makes fun games but still doesnt understand the meaning of satire five or how i learned to stop worrying and love the load times the best descriptor is this its okay gtav replaces actual humor with slurs interesting characters with stereotypes i forget how many neon signs i found with transmisogynistic slurs on them but i know theres a few which is a few too many so yeah you know its gta as per usual offensive just to be offensive without any actual social commentary if you ignore every other line of dialogue and 75% of the text youll find a fun game if you cant tune out garbage writing and bad characterization youll find out why these people are writing puns for shop signs and toooften repeated lines for npcs in video games instead of working on their third internationally acclaimed novel i really dont know if i do or do not recommend this game to be honest id like a this sure is a video game that exists and some people might like option but i guess ill have to settle for a yes or no yes if you intend to play both single player and online for at least 200 hours or if you have friends to play it with who also want to play online for at least 200 hours but if you want to play through the story just rent it on a console or pirate it honestly if you could play gta online without paying full price for the game id recommend you do that because $60 for a game that is in essence that older guy on the back of a school bus pretending to be cool and telling bad jokes to twelve year olds because theyre the only ones wholl laugh id waste your money on something that youll at least remember in a month

it was a great game for awhile but after the whole on sale joke and now the complete random banwave of innocent people im just very dissapointed rockstar doesnt even allow people that have been banned to make tickets because on the support forum their accounts are also flagged so they cant even post anything its disgusting to see such a big game business acting so overconfident and not caring at all about their player base let alone the fact that they cant even properly protect their game in online play not before and not even after the banwave for a game of 50 thats completely unacceptable

so i started this game awe and wonder were in my eyes as one who had only heard of the legend called gta and had never played gta ever i know edit apparently after becoming 3 on the reviews on the gta v store page my review got removed after more research ive noticed that all my funny votes are gone pros beautiful open world online play has a lot of options first person is a cool option but wasnt particularly enjoyable for me runs great great nvidia surround support 3 monitors cons no male strippers 810 girls want to have fun too you know

gta v has been reviewed and played by many and for the vast majority of gamers it has worked smoothly and given them a great single and multiplayer experience however not all is well and good i have found my game absoloutly riddled with bugs framerate issus login errors the game not even being recognizeed as downloaded not too recently i own a fairly high end gpu and a moderatly strong cpu and i still experience drops from 5060 fps all the way down to 15 on a constant basis emailing rockstar support with this issue only ended up with them apologising for my problems not offering any support or fixes at the time of writing im really unhappy with the game ive spent hours searching through youtube videos online forums asking friends advice but not no avail my current issue is that rockstars social club failed to update even after me reinstalling the program i know im just a tiny minority of the huge amount of people playing the game with significant problems like mine but somethiing really needs to be done you probably wont experience the same issues i know many people in my friends list dont but for me the game is pretty much unplayable

note a to the point review with no spoilers the singleplayer story feels abrupt and haphazard as though it were told by a second grader with adhd character development is shallow at best with arcs as defined as mr magoos sight understand that any story judgement is purely subjective but when i compare it to previous gta titles five falls quite short the voice acting sound effects and textures are all amazing these three areas in particular are what i see as the only saving graces of the game and their respective departments should be proud the multiplayer is a disheveled exploitive mess with netcode reminiscent of battlefield 4 at launch and rockstars constant kneecapping of any method of progression one main issues plaguing online is faux longevity caused by constant reduction rockstars patches in amount of rp experience you can gain making it take longer to obtain level locked items the other primary and worst offender in any game is freemium inflation caused by devaluing the ingame currency thus leading to highcost items and low currency gains from missions the devalued currency is solely there to encourage people to buy rockstars shark cards and is tactic synonymous with poor game quality and no respect for the consumer conclusion overall i would value grand theft auto v at $20 if you pay more than this you will feel swindled i understand companies are primarily about the bottom line but as it stand this was a deplorable misstep to cash in and leaves me feeling robbed unless changes are made in future updates this marks the last rockstar game i will buy i no longer have any confidence in the companys ability to deliver a solid game unbridled by greed

what an a$$hole move by rockstar raising the price for the summer sale to make people buy some stupid stuff for online i wonder why the base game is still full price and the base game and online money is 23$ less and for a few cents more youg et san andreas or max payne 3 why the fuck is the base game still full price rockstar sure for cheaper you get more but for a lot of people they just want the freakin game and play it and want nothing extra i love this game but a move like that is unacceptable rockstar this just forces people to buy something a lot of people simply do not want should of preordered if you wanted extra online money now work your a$$ off to gain money last sentence is for rockstar so dont take it personal reader

played it for a few hours on pc i have to say i definitely prefer it on the pc over the console version it seems to run much smoother looks nicer the controls are easy driving is definitely a huge improvement compared to gta iv where that was just awful all together rockstar definitely proved me wrong after the amount of rage i went through on gta iv and how much of a crappy pc port it was along with all the buggy video editor errors all of that seems to be fixed in gta v pc with a tidier video editor and less buggy overall oh and no more gfwl yes well done rockstar definitely worth buying

i have to admit im really disappointed but happy at the same time the game itself is great i love the new features graphics characters etc however there are so many bugs and problems it makes playing impossible the first most annoying problem is the crashing at startup the game crashes after looping the intro sound for about 5 minutes only after that can you play by pressing the retry button second the game is very very very laggy after playing about 10 minutes of smooth as silk gameplay the game fluctuates from high fps to 0 in many stutters it is not my pc or anything because the game is very smooth with inconsistent frequent stutters not a rough constant fps this makes playing unbearable even low fps would be preferred lastly a few minor bugs are that in the voice settings menu if you go down to it the game automatically freezes and crashes update for some reason i played today and got dream results no crashing for the first time ever when opening and it did not stutter once even after leaving the game for some time amazing getting to play the game the way it was meant to be played i only hope it stays this way

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

great game honestly but bumping the price to 8000usd before the summer sale just to be able to say 25% off is a scum move

for a studio that is clearly making money handoverfist already rockstars cashgrabbing antics are pretty dispicable and its a shame because gta v is a fantastic game once you look past the loading times broken lobby system unbalanced pvp and social club drm first they try to force people onto their own drm platform by restricting retail copies from being activated on steam all to save the standard 30% cut to valve but thats nothing compared to intentionally misleading customers by jacking the price and applying a 25% discount which brings the price a massive 1 lower than the previous asking price its nothing more than a deliberate attempt to mislead people into thinking theyre getting a discount when they are not unfortunately most consumper protection law does not apply to steam thanks to that handy subscriber agreement regardless its worth noting that in scotland where rockstar are based this is completely illegal

ive been playing this game since day 1 when it came out for 4 days straight everyday for aprox 18 hours in less than 3 days i finished the main missions and most of the optional side missions game completion at 75% without stealing more than 3 carsvehicles in total in the stats i have trevor with one police car stolen and michael with one firetruck and a taxi stolen franklin didnt steal no nothing i also played on the side online in that game time and reached a rank over 20 its great fun with or without friends it feels like this game is a drug that stole my lifebut i dont regret a thing things i really enjoyed and you should probably do too the game despite its large size its amazingly optimized with many graphic options to tweak i have exactly the minimum requirements and i can run it sure i had to turn every fancy pc enchanting option off and it looks like the graphics on the oldgen consoles but i am happy it works with 30fps the missions are really captivating the money spending system feels more challenging because you have a lot to spend it on to invest it to simly lose it you get to meet many interesting sidecharacters and the overall voiceacting is really good besides the actual story and the many twists in the missions they have quite a replay value due to their minichallenges for each of them like finish in the required time complete it in a certain order etc if you are a completionist the car handleing amazing the gave up the gta iv simulator like driving and brought back the arcade like car handling from the older ones where you can rotate in the air or do some nice stunts the world is really immersing each npc with its small story with their interactions etc its a living world filled with living people animals and momentsand with internet radio and cable tv i cant quite say there is a lot of choice based tasks but there is a really decent number of those most of them involving planning or the interaction choice but as long as you have imagination there will always be a choice its great that we have animals you can kill them you can playinteract with them you can even become them at a certain point hidden easter egg most of the people are avereage aged from 2060 or so i kinda wished we also had the extrems like children or quite old peoplesure it would probablly create some controversy but it would make give the game an even more real feeling and i could enumerate so many morebut now i have to get back to the game

welcome to 2015 where cops just spawn in front of you from thinair first of all i enjoyed the game both single and online but there are just some so dumb things in the game that makes me so sad it couldve been a so much better experience with more caring about the little things nice delays tho cons online p2p servers in itself it wouldnt be a problem but for some reason me and my buddies always get thrown in a horribly lagging session with a guy being host with horrible connection the cop system is extremly dumb just randomly appear in the nowhere i was in front of a mountain then i saw a cop just spawn there and continue to chase me aight a onestar chase can be longer then a fivestar one thats pretty legit you get banned for using mods any mods basically fov adjuster because you can set your fov to 7075 at max thats  you get banned if you use mods single or online so there goes that because of p2p servers most of the times you can empty a magazine into a person and take a whole zero damage and then all you can see is he hits you once and youre dead basically until the modban thing there were no anticheat system because of p2p servers sometimes mechanic doesnt seem to care about you shatting on your head even if he had his payment singleplayer i feel like the graphics options on itself is useless just like in watch dogs i get the same fps on 800x600 lowest settings then on 1920x1080 everything high how is that possible even the vehicles you buy you have to take care of them otherwise you just lose them afaik theres no option like online to get it back sadly sometimes random events one npc stole money from another etc are just straight up not working you return the stuff the npc that got robbed just despawns though its rare cons that are common in both single and online you cant aim straight up that is really dumb the fps mode because of the low fov can easily cause motion sickness first game that caused me motion sickness in 10 years that i played on the other hand pros online fun online if youre getting paired with a good host different races land bike sea plane theft protection and insurance this is what the singplayer is missing if your vehicle gets destroyed you can just call mmi and theyll provide you with the same car usually other players blow up your car in that case if it has both protection and insurance theyll pay some money 1% of the cars price and you can call mmi to get it back free mechanic brings you a selected car from your garage if you give him a call and decides to not be lazy pretty neat character creation you can create unique characters with it payout is quite good for the effortreward system heists are fun with pretty good payout depending on difficulty and on host how he sets the payout on the last day of the heist in heists it gives you the feel that everyone is equally needed if you have no team lives left and someone dies the three cant clutch it because the heist will fail single loveable characters hateable kids im looking at you jimmy the story mode is pretty fun it has its own moments you can chose out of a three possible ending two of them affects the endgame assasination missions with franklin lets you play stock market in your favour it is quite op actually but hey its single so it could be either con or pro depending on which side of you are the autosave function in missions are quite casualfriendly usually if you do something in a mission and you happen to die or fail with the objective youll be booted back to that part or a bit earlier after you done the main story theres still a lot stuff to do if you havent done it while playing the story already and have chosen the third option as of the ending mission if i were to press myself i could still write a lot to the pro con side i think they even themselves out though the fov and the cop system is a really big downer overall id say im recommending the game and at the same time not its fun but it has a dark side that can really screw you over if youd just like to hop in and play a few contact missions or heists for tldr people buy this game at your own risk dont expect high quality online servers its fun if you get lucky with a host isnt worth 60 euros in my eyes though as of being already an almost 2 years old game and its painfully obvious flaws cheers

my history with the grand theft auto games goes all the way back to gta2 on the ps1 that game blew me away when i first played it i honestly thought the freedom it offered you was an illusion and that the game would spontaniously end but it never did and i kept playing it over and over again nowadays sandbox games are a dime a dozen but rockstar has remained top dog in the fight since the ps2 why unlike volition who make excuses as to why they couldnt provide features everyone liked rockstar takes risks and gives you things you never thought you wanted gta5 takes place in los santos which was previously featured in gta san andreas los santos by far is the most detailed single location in the entire series the game features things like industrial ghettos vast mountains with wilderness and expansive oceans you can swim through and uncover secrets while dodging sharks it lets you seamlessly switch between three protagonists who are not only just as detailed as any of the previous ones but are also completely distinguishable from each one with individual sidequests and unique gameplay modes gta5 looks great plays great feels distinctive and most importantly took risks that paid off immensly in a world of botched launches underwhelming overhyped titles and a desire for a game the developers actually cared about making gta5 goes above and beyond the call of duty it is hard to describe any one flaw with this game without comparing the 2000 things it does well what other modern game can you say the same httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid432237450

my review of grand theft auto v will be based on 4 categories performance gameplay graphics and story  performance edit  looks like rockstars latest patch illgotten gains part ii involving antimodding and antihacking measures degraded performance by a big degree  obviously rockstar learned from gta ivs misfires because the game is optimized as heck the max payne 3 porting team really did a good job with gta v as this has got to be the most optimized aaa pc game available out there as of writing pc exclusive features check tons of graphics options check runs good check its almost good enough to be called a pc exclusive game performance on a fx6300 processor r9 270 gpu and 8 gb of ram in a 1080p resolution with the graphics settings below yields an average of 45 fps with a minimum of 22 fps graphics options available  httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid431711719 note that im already at the red zone and im still running this game with decent fps however since i am in the red zone im experiencing minor graphical issues with the game like textures not loading properly and visual artifacts appearing everywhere albeit rarely on the technical side of things the game has loads of bugs and lots of crashes nothing gamebreaking and serious but it is annoying as hell from missions not triggering unless you load again to the game freezing unexpectedly everyone definitely has a story or two to tell about the games persistent problems gta v also comes packed with the rsc which is still annoying as heck but somewhat tolerable to a degree for a list of currently known bugs and their respective fixes please visit this page [pcgamingwikicom]  gameplay  main game gta v is a very fun game with lots of things to do as more and more iterations of the series comes out so does the amount of new content that aims to give the player the perfect lifesimulation game without the killing of course the city of los santos is littered with a variety of activities that will cater to everyones taste like golf and tennis more extreme ones like base jumping and skydiving or just mod your car and listen to the licensed and original music while taking a drive around the city and meet the very fascinating populace that somehow has a touch of realism in them yet contains just the right amount of fiction gta v still follows its traditional gameplay structure where blips in the map indicate a person of interest random events pop up on your map as you drive around the city and get close to them the simple touch of adding robberies in stores people asking you for help or npcs complimenting you for your highend clothes slick and stylish haircut and heavily modded sports car while being dbags at the same time makes the game world feel very alive and real for the completionist at heart collectibles litter the world map from top to bottom side to side and under the ocean that will have you driving a submarine down to the deepest depths of the pacific combat is still the same as iv but with a very obvious touch of max payne 3s gameplay  in fact you can say that youre playing max payne 3 whenever a firefight erupts the only new feature that rockstar added to the combat are the special abilities michael has bullet time franklin has bullet time when driving a car and trevor has his rage ability where he increases his damage to enemies while being bulletproof at the same time ai is still same dumb same old enemies take cover for half a second just to get their heads blown open they never flank you  in the chance that they seem like they do its because its part of a mission script and the most common tactic of the enemy is to run towards you in the middle of a gunfight regarding the law the wanted stars have been lowered down to five levels instead of six and will cause a citywide lockdown the funny thing about the law is that theyre so sensitive and prone to shooting you just for very petty things standing beside a police officer and just looking at your phone you get shot accidentally tackling a guard just because you were chasing somebody you get shot and the one youre chasing escapes trying to help officers chase down a robber by shooting the robbers tires the officers ignore the robbers and you get shot sometimes i think that rockstar intended the law to be this way because of the parodical nature of the game gta v isnt a perfect game it still has a long way to go if it wants to give us a balanced and wellrounded gameplay experience rockstar is starting already by giving us replayable missions with a ranking system that depends on the number of objectives that you complete yet youll see that your still have to follow each and every objective as stated by the devs the hang out feature is still a great addition from the past gta games yet it still does nothing in terms of story progression activities fill the map but only some of them are really significant because they reward you with something and not just there as features that most casual players wont even try i hope that these problems get fixed as the series goes but not just in pieces problems should be fixed then and there gameplay  online online modes fun factor is almost the same as story modes yet with a few hitches that ruin the experience like very very long loading times and rampant cheating theres also the issue with heists being the dominant activity to do all year round sure its fun as hell but i feel that rockstar isnt promoting the other activities too much like arm wrestling and tennis which in turn is just being ignored by many players graphics the city of los santos is perhaps the most detailed game world to ever exist as of writing the amount of work that theyve done and the attention to detail is just amazing locations are very varied and interesting small touches like garbage in the streets and graffiti painted to the walls add a sense of uniqueness that is seen only in los santos and the very diverse npcs that walk the street are very detailed animations are realistic facial expressions and lipsyncing makes the characters almost human and the lighting and shadow effects makes the digital game world almost real story for the first time ever in gta history gta v revolves around three playable protagonists whose lives have been intertwined by coincidence michael is a retired robber who isnt satisfied with a very successful career and wants to get back into the game just for the experience of it franklin is a young repo man who everyone thinks is the relative they never had and wants to get out of a life of petty crime and make it to the big leagues trevor is the psycho that rockstar put into the game to satisfy the young kids who thinks that psychopaths make the best characters and very clearly has little backstory aside from mommy issues and speed addiction even though the game has three playable protagonists its pretty clear that the story is focused on michael as he has the most drama the one with the most responsibility and the whole plot basically revolves around him also out of all three his goals are clearly more believable and relatable since hes a family man whos trying to be the best father for his very dysfunctional family yet cant do it because if emotional problems of his own as is rockstars tradition with gta america is still the backdrop and the whole premise of the game can be considered as a parody of sorts of the country and there you have it

let me give an honest review while i would recommend this game to friends because the game itself is a blast you must be warned that the company behind it has fallen from grace since this games launch yes i play this game often but ive learned to deal with the stress and anger the game can bring me why do i say that lets break it down company history  410 simple rockstar was a dedicated game developer from the early 2000s until right about 2013 the intial gta v era 2015 swings around and the pc version is finally ready they release it to a preordering public knowing the game wasnt launchready and recieve a wave of broken reports two weeks later they remove the ability to get several guns and vehicles all because current pc players dont have or have played the console version which means you have to spend $120 to get a few items then comes the infamous summer sale scam of 2015 rockstar charging flat $60 for their game whether you buy the base a shark card that would undo the refundability of your game or the game bound with another game just massive profit whoring just like with the shark card the ill gotten gains update added a plane costing $10000000gta and the megaladon shark card of $8000000gta is $100usd which means the luxor deluxe to rockstar is worth $125usd absolutely absurd singplayer playability  710 gta v as a game is great its aesthetically pleasing and flowing controls far better than iv ever did and just feels more alive than any previous installment while lacking the proper absurdity of game like san andreas and vice city it was its own breed of good and as a singleplayer game it was very pleasing as for the replayability the game becomes dreadfully boring after you beat the main story the game gives no incentive to complete the remaining 40% of the game once the main story is over and you dont get hardly enough money from the final job to enjoy anything in the game the only reason singleplayer gets a 7 out of 10 is purely because the main story is fantastic and well done online playability  010 i wish my scale went negative everything rockstar promised in online simply isnt there no hacking allowed they said im yet to find a lobby without one instantly joins lobbies with your friends they said nope every game i join always says my friends are in other games better anticheat software they say nope if anything there has been a spike in hackers more content they say ill gotten gains was a money sink not a content additon the game is pathetically boring after completing the 5 heists that have no replayability to them and farming countless missions races and deathmatches until you get sick of even seeing your own apartment amongst the personal issues with online there is also the issue that there is so much possiblity and hardly anything done to match it no realistic immersion to the game no bars no car shows no dance clubs no cafes no way to relax with friends and only one club a strip club the game is hopefully going to be adding mansions in ill gotten gains part 2 which would grant more freedoms to players such as owning a pool and a tennis court but there needs to be more immersion the game only has 1 golf course when there could easily be 2 more 1 in the desert and 1 in the mountains or paleto bay area the game also lacks any way of bringing the community together to do events the only events that happen in free roam are chaos inducing ones which a lot of players avoid there needs to be raves on the beach or maybe even events like car shows or drag races that players can attend and spectate or participate in in free mode theres just sooo much the game can be that it just isnt the most recent update also brought my average frames from 70 stable on very high to about 15 and choppy until it crashes on the lowest settings rockstar flat out broke their game and even high tier machines struggle with it now they decided to combat mods and hacks by adding several hundred lines of false code to the game which as a result broke the game and left mods and hacks completely unharmed the game is broken and unplayable and until its fixed very few people will be able to play online game overall  310 the lack of support from rockstars end combined with the malestrom that is gta online and the quickly overbearingly boring singleplayer mode i have to say this game went from the best thing to ever happen to pc gaming to a sad excuse of how a good game developer can go bad very quickly will i continue to play this game yes i enjoy it but there is a lot to improve on will i recommend it to friends yes i enjoy playing with friends and the game is a great way to hang out with them but will i recommend it to you no unless you know more than 5 people who own it and play it regularly its just simply not worth your money your time is of your choice but dont give rockstar your money recap developer score  410 base game score  710 online game score  010 ninjas game score  510 final score  410 would not recommend unless you really just need something to waste time on with friends and be constantly disappointed in both the developing company and the community behind it when updates come out and break the game the pure amount of hackers will drive you away quickly and if they dont rockstars endless attempts to get more money from you without any effort from them

i bought it to play online with my friends but it just became such a frustrating experience actually trying to play with them it sucked all the fun out of it for me the loading times are appalling getting into a server with someone you know is a nightmare staying in that server for longer than a single mission  race or whatever is totally random and i constantly desych with one friend who lives less than an hour from me i mean come on to even start a server you have to wait the ten years for it to load you into single player first and thats only if you want to create one from boot if you happen to already be online then you have to drop out of online via ten minutes of loading screens load single player then load online again  at some point in the future ill get the desire to play through the single player and will probably enjoy it but im so disappointed in the online aspect which was the big lure for me that im not rerally in any rush to load it up again

impressions of playing the game mostly online this will be an online gameplay review well i purchased gtav all i can say is i didnt realise i purchased loading simulator 2020 hd edition kidding aside to elaborate of my 91hours on record at this moment its safe to say ive spent 34 of it loading holy crap man on start up online mode missionsheists starting them inbetween choosing more missions finishing missionsheists which constantly crash while loading which gets you locked loading with no way out other than to either alt  f4 or try join someone elses game with rockstar social club thing if anyone else is on though this is a personal niche of mine cutscenes that you cant skip & some you can after you have seen it before if one person hasnt seen one before in heists sit back and watch a good 5min odd cutscene each time thats just some parts that need loading i know what your thinking well of course you need to wait for loading stupid head and your right good job fellow nublet see now this wouldnt be an issue at all assuming loading times were minimal and the amount of times to load were minimal but hey that would be too mainstream 5min loading time average assuming you dont time outcrash and need to load up the whole damn game from the beginning and as mentioned above theres just too much if you want to make people load up 5 mins for 2mins of gameplay thats fine i guess at least make sure it god damn loads up now lets get into things that need fixes like joining friends sometimes you cant join friends from a number of issues like having not done tutorialeven though you have done it before also an issue where you may be buying stuff from convenience store dude for snacks and if someone comes around and holds it up while your in it you are stuck there unable to move or get out even after the thing is over missing weapons sometimes you lose weaponslose all weapons and need to buy them all again idling time out 2min idle time it seems which is fair enough but i personally think its too short maybe 5minsonly a problem since you gotta load in again yay more loading screens which funny enough if your stuck in a loading screen you cant idle out which is the only thing i can imagine the idle out being somewhat useful in fact as i am typing this i am stuck loading launching a mission for the past 10mins with no way out because you cant just press esc to leave the only way out is to alt  f4 and exit the whole game and load it up from the beginning which takes about 510mins just to boot up i just no words wait loading simulator 2020 hd edition all that negitive aside the game runs great when it works which is funny because sometimes as your playing the game still crashes happens randomly though not too often though i wouldnt know having not really played much of the god damn game sorry too busy crashing at loading screens and sitting through loading screens to get a really good run end rant p seriously though i would recommend this game easy balls if people could actually run it without pulling hair out at every minute of loading

i am not even banned but if they wont allow mods i cant give it a positive review you cant just flat out ban fov mods and embs

i understand if rockstar doesnt want people to mod the online that makes perfect sense but why can we not have simple gamefixing mods like fov for singleplayer the modding community has so much to offer this game now people are being banned for single player mods like wtf rockstar let us mod the game and more people will want to play it fairly simple concept i do not recommend this game because although it has unlimited potential as a sandbox game were not allowed to use our own tools in the sandbox to create what we want bad game do not buy 510 with mods 1010

gta v on pc is finally here which was delayed for 1 year 6 months 28 days but it can easily be forgiven because the content is already awesome and its technically stunning it feels like a new los santos there is no open world game that can match that and the rockstar editor offers such an easy access and so many possibilities in terms of clipsmovies creation that we can only be sure that the pleasure will last for a long long time the game is well optimized for pc as well excellent work rockstar

so i havent played any gta since gta 2 1997 and that has been one of my favorite games from my teenage years i skipped gta 3 and 4 mainly because i didnt care for the change from 2d top down to 3d third person however seeing the total biscuit review for the game convinced me to give this game a try honestly im blown away in regards to how good this game actually is the attention to detail and the grand scale of the world is really amazing i have only a few hours in so far but i am completely sold by how good the game actually is and look forward to playing it for many hours more

i wish i were able to say what an amazing game it is sadly i cant yes the single player is amazing immense etc i loved it but as for most people for me it would be about the online here are some facts no anticheat or any possibility to filter hackers online hackers ruin free roam mode they freeze you in a spot they spawn ufos in front of your 3 million game dollar costing jet that you had been farming for 4 days non stop heist and missions they have miniguns which shoot moneybags corrupting other players who are begging for these internet gods for pennies not realizing that it ruins their game too as there will be no value for them to buy anything they use godmode autoaim etc you stand no chance againist them they hold all the races world records with like 20 milliseconds still no joystick support i never played with a joypad and im not planning to do so i bought a 50 costing joystick only for this game to learn that it is so console smelling that the dear creators ignored to put joy stick support into the game i made it work through a profiler program that makes it kinda work although it is not the best solution because it mimics keyboard not a joypad and it was a pain to set up and now as the trial expired it wants me to pay for it too rockstars excuse from a pc release was the torrenting like others i paid good money as soon as it was released as i pay for all the games i like and play rockstar your argument is invalid we paid to play and sadly we paid to play a game that could have been the best game ever created i could speak hour about the beauty of the landscape the nice sunsets the effects and everything sadly it is dwarfed by those issues i mentioned and it is just a part of it here is this nice new dlc how is it called ah ill gotten goods yes it is ill it brings you a few shiny cars jets jewellery whatever it just doesnt bring the change that was promised servers are still full of hackers my joystick still doesnt want to work guys you developed on pc it is not a console why do you want to force me to buy a console controller and the mouse control is still very console like i am very disappointed probably like many others yes buy the game play offline then uninstall it and forget otherwise you just get mad because of the lack of caring in online the funny thing is that rockstar is selling game money so the hackers are killing their business too they still not care

i write reviews so rarely but this game needs one let me give you five reasons why 1st the loading times i have no idea why this game loads so incredibly long i can basically get some coffee while im joining a session or loading story mode for that matter its not my connection and definitely not my computer my friends have the same issues 2nd the netcode whatever they did there they failed horribly its incredible how this game just sucks your internet connection dry i can play it but everyone who does not have a 16mbits connection or a slower computer has serious lags that make the game nearly unplayable 3rd the stability when the game came out you were not able to switch back to fullscreen mode the screen remained black and the game needed to be shut down they fixed that one at least i also dont get any crashes personally but i know at least three people who get them regulary one of them is in my heist team so we need to restart heists from time to time which sucks badly 4th the social club why the hell does that garbage even exist anymore basically everything the social club does can also be done through steam when i want to open a party in team fortress 2 or dota 2 i just invite people through steam so when you implement a drm like social club in your game why not just steam the social features of steam have never failed me social club does on a regular basis not only do invites not reach me often even if they do they are heavily delayed but the worst part about social club by far is the security i have no idea if it is still the case but in the first few weeks thousands of accounts were stolen hell a friend needed nearly two weeks to get his account back at least he did eventually and it was not because he had a weak password but because even he was able to get into other peoples accounts after he researched a bit on the topic 5th the most dickish move a publisher could actually make we write the 11th of june people are eagerly awating the steam sale to buy a game which has been out on consoles for years now they dont want to pay 60 for it might be because they dont want to because it is such an old game or because they simply dont want or can spend that much money on a single game whatever is true does not matter at all they just awaited at least a 15 or 20% deal on the game as we always get during such sales but what happens with the start of the steam sale rockstar releases dlcs that just give you ingame money you can also get through normaly doing heists the bundle the game with one of those dlcs so the price increases to 75 but hey people still want their sale right so we do a 25 discount so the game basically matches the usual 60 price tag people will love that right right no they freakin dont and while i did pay the full 60 when the game came out i regretted it so much since then and i was one of the people who defended rockstar so much in the beginning yeees the game is years old but that does not make the gameplay worse it also has much better graphics even than ps4 and xbone it is even a good port this time so while the story is pretty enjoyable everything else about this game is not it has pretty much destroyed it for me im not sure if i will even finish the  story

do not buy this game is a loud of  it never works i have had error after error as of writing this i am 188 hours into the game and it has not been worth all the hassle the game breaks every few days after every update patch anything after any minor change to your pcs settings it goes on a mad one and there are no fixes because they are all claiming to be for one issue when in actuality they are for another or they only fix issues for laptop users or they dont even work for anybody do not give rockstar your money for this 70100 at best game by doing so you will allow them to do this and encourage them to do so for other games also some shady stuff going on for the summer sale too a villanous comapny no doubt avoid this game they made no effort car interiors are all the same not much to do in online glitchy game comes up with a new reason for me being unable to play with it everyday my pc is more than capable of running this meh looking game i can max metro but there are very long laggy periods and the game often has intense lag when comming out of your garage to fix it you must wait for about 5 seconds then get out of the car you just came out in then get back in they could not be asked to make a decent game despite making us wait for ages and making us pay far to much for a game avoid this company does not deserve your money the gameplay is good in online but you will spend a lot of time fixing the game or grinding unless you hackget help from a hackermodder the game gets fun when you have money but you wont be able to do lots of the things in it or customise carsoutfits to your wanting as lots of stuff is locked to a certain level which you will have no fun reaching at all because heists are clunky and boring single player is fun and the story is engaging but the car system is very annoying and the single player is glitchy and confusing in general pirate this game for the single player if you can or wait to buy it for 10 in like 510 years if the game still works by then if you like spending 9 hours trying to fix something and then realising there is no way to fix it because half the fixes for errors only work for certain people normally laptop users if you are true master race on a desktop you are screwed this is the game for you and a prison for the crimanly insane is the place for you

too long dont read loading screen simulator reset your internet simulator reset your modem simulator restart your game simulator long & read this is my opinion about online only for those who dont care about online the story mode is as good as it looks you dont have to question it the environment and physics is so great for a free roaming game that i dont need to care about the storyline the story or any other thing is just an extra plus to what has been purely great running around the city and do whatever you want creating havoc is so satisfying but here i will only talk about online the online gameplay is awesome but with technical issues the experience is completely ruined and most of the time is a frustration to play this could be loading screen simulator of the year when playing online loading a simple menu  loading screen after it loaded the game is already full either you choose to queue or leave  loading screen suddenly disconnected from crappy rockstar servers  loading screen back to story mode trying to go online again  loading screen cant they happen to add a maximum waiting time and only disconnect when time out the purpose of playing online the main enjoyment out of it is to be able to play with your friends but it is really difficult here where you have high chances losing each other when joining random online game cant they have a party function so all friends can be together yes they do have a party function but it is for the whole group of random people who have been in the room and to leave that group and try to rejoin your friends after having losing each other is something really time consuming and there are many loading screens waiting for you on the way of course and after getting over all these loading screens you will not be able to join your friends if they happen to be in a job if everyone wants to play together they have to quit the job  rockstar will fine them and make them a bad sport gradually for quitting why cant they add the feature to join while the job is in progress people can quit the job but new people cant join yes this is so fair rockstar these connection issues continue with heist missions one player suddenly disconnected thanks to rockstar awesome server  everyone failed i spent 2 hours just to wait and invite people to a heist mission in which when we were about to finish a heist member randomly left yes because of rockstar server only 10 meters away from the finish mark and we saw all our work of the last 10 game time minutes got dumped into the sea and like 99% of the time joining a heist you have to watch the cutscene over and over again because all 4 heisters have to completed it as a leader before being able to skip it what if someone is so frustrated with r server or just only like to play as a crew member doing heist is really a pain in the neck not because its difficult but because rockstar server is so good at making peoples game more difficult and it is so rage inducing the game design forcibly requires 4 people to do heist well im really really fine with bots stupid bots are ok but just dont die please yet rockstar force me to play with people and on the other hand they suck at letting me to and random people joining you will most of the time just do stupid thing and die i can actually do all the heist mission alone if there is ever any bot i dont need random people to make my game harder the online game is great but the raging the frustration makers it packed in equally destroy all the experience it is like r made a really good meal for you but you just cant eat it the moment when you can taste it is awesome but most of the time r server will keep you out of this delicious meal making you dying to taste it

everyone was looking so much forward to the gta v pc release  was hyped so much and then r released the worst gtaonline piece of  which barely is playable the story mode is amazing and theyve done a good job with that and the graphics of the game but gtaonline is a straight up joke for the missing anticheat mass lags cheap servers disgusting matchmaking takes 8 loading screens to play a heist cheap console ported mechanics random kicks and the game is so flawed that it makes me wonder if this is a closed alpha or maybe early beta gta v is not worth 60 eur if you already played the story mode before online part is straight garbage and is not even worth 10 eur and at this point i really doubt that r ever will be able to fix gtaonline many of the issues are known from consoles and not to mention the economy is permanently broken from people using cheat engine and other simple things so it seems like many of the bugs are here to stay and some damage is already way beyond repair 1010 would not buy again inb4 r fanboy hate <3

ignore all the idiots complaining about mods rockstar said themselves that singleplayer mods are fine most people who got banned were modifying their fov among other things which is still an unfair advantage in the online mode being able to see more at either side is an advantage for any of you slow in the head people trying to defend it anyways onto the main review id never played any of the console versions of gta v so ive come along as a fresh newbie so far ive been completely wowd by the whole experience the city feels so alive with the pure density of npcs and some of the views are absolutely breath taking the story is in comparison to gta iv about just as gritty its however dampened by the amount of humor piled in with a lot of help from the amazing acting work im not quite sure how long ive spent on the story mode alone but rest assured theres a lot of content to ensure youre playing it for a good while online mode is simply amazing granted some people on there seem to be blind to the fact that this isnt gta iv freeroam theres so much more to do cooperative missions and activities alike are very abundant when youre tired of shooting things up stop and play tennis with a friend or arm wrestle some random dude whos way stronger than you for a laugh heck go skydiving with your buddies and take in the amazing views as the sun begins to set this game has far exceeded my expectations especially in comparison to gta iv

final edit  its still not a good deal to buy the game full price gta online is a mess with tons of loading screens desynch issues and general issues the singleplayer game runs fine looks good and is interesting storywise but is it worth 60 bucks  im not convinced the modding community is finally getting official support but im skeptic as to how long it will take before rockstar actually does something to actually support modders other than not banning them wait for a good discount and for killer mods to come out rest of the review is older but left here for convenience crashes freezes stuttering memory leaks the port isnt horrible far from it but waiting two years two delays and seeing four versions for consoles come out anything that is worse than a great port is unnacceptable we only have so much patience for one game if you still have any wait for a patch edit 1  the nvidia drivers that came through fixed most of the stuttering issues but the memory leaks and the random crashes still happen even though the game runs fine waiting is still the name of the game edit 2  2304 still waiting for loadings improvements on gta online and still has random crashes associated to random actions game runs well and smooth though edit 3  705 theres been some improvements for some users and bug fixing for gta online but theres been a lot of issues with modding with the latest patch basically killing mods altogether and forcing users to downgrade their game to keep enjoying custom content theres been bans from the game altogether singleplayer and multiplayer because of fov mods which is necessary to enjoy 1st person camera and not have a headache for some people the whole affair is a mess and its not a good incentive to spend money on the game

it was worth the weight almost even after it have been out for about 2 years its still a huge buggy mess i cant really imagine those bugs being releated to just the pc version heists are barely even working sometimes resulting you having to restart the game if im right heists are a quite recent update after about 5 retries i finally completed the first heist without having the game bugging out for me other than heists stores sometimes dont spawn in time physics glitches etc etc and yea a huge memory leak issue which i still think is there make sure you have at least 16 gb of ram and nothing else opened i have 16 gb of ram and windows have crashed a few times when running out of ram closing everything else seems to have solved it

the hackers rule the online the game is full of glitches that either stops you from playing or are really annoying the loading screen is what ive seen for half the amount of time ive played this game you would think they would try to fix the most important glitches but instead keep trying to sell us these ing useless cards also i have to give rockstar credit for the biggest greedy move ive ever seen in the video game industry as of now increasing the price of your game by adding an obligatory card to buy that puts the game at the same price once with the sale than before the sale and the card bought actually restrains you from the possibility of getting a refund since its a digital product and given how this game is broken lots of people who cant play the game because of it wont be able to get a refund and rockstar support sucks horribly and they will have wasted 56  on this game overall if you wanted this game on this sale for the solo youre ed because of the price if you wanted for the online youre ed because of the hackers if your computer is at risk of not being able to run the game properly you are double ed in the butt

game itself is good but rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice theyre forcing you to buy the game and shark cards which are just ingame multiplayer money while the game is on sale this shouldnt be acceptable its basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming its on sale update for anyone wondering why i said forced to buy it bundled during the first few hours of the sale you couldnt buy gta v by itself you had to buy one of the bundles if you wanted the game
not recommended
i never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big rockstar has priced gta v to $80 and reduced it to $60 then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra  no one wants by bundling the game with the micro transaction money anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund not only is this a violation of ftc regulation and eu law it is the biggest  move i have seen on steam yet i would have rather had my $60 go to the warz devs than this  since then rockstar has added the ability to buy gta v alone for $60 truly a noble move they dont even have this level of garbage business on consoles
not recommended
rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet sweet steam summer sale 010 would not recommend again update okay so some people dont understand why people including myself are mad that the base game is not on sale when steams summer sale first began the base game of gta v was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 1020 minutes instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base games price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business im not mad that the base game isnt on sale its their right as a company to not have to put it on sale im just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics

shady business practices im not going to support it this is borderline if not full blown false advertising no anticheating system in place resulting in an endless amount of hackers who ruin the experience by killing you from out of nowhere crashing your game and even framing other players by killing everyone on the server using their username to add insult to injury rockstar doesnt do jack sht to prevent any of this and the process of reporting a single case of hacking takes a needless amount of effort is the game fun yes it is it would have been even more fun if rockstar werent smelling their own farts all the time and actually knuckle down to resolve all the issues that the pc version has seriously is this the best they could do after more than two years they had all the time and resources in the world to make sure this doesnt happen its like this game was made by an indie team of threeorso people

hackers everywhere online until rockstar gets their head out of their asses dont buy the game unless you wanna deal with a bunch of asshats with god mode and explosive weapons turned on dont get me wrong the game itself is great and very well optimized but for the time being anything involving multiplay in the game is completely ruined as theres generally 1 hackers per game session client side multiplayer gaming that doesnt even have a proper anticheat yeah wow great idea all rockstar cares about right now is money they have a pretty complex anticheat for money but thats it who cares about the actual gameplay right

bought it for the online mode it was fun the first month before everyone started hacking now its unplayable hackers have every weapon can spawn any vehicle they like have unlimited money and can kill any player they like by just pressing a button and guess what rockstar doesnt give a  will never buy a rockstar game again

this game is now on the summer sale of 2015 and they added 12 million ingame dollars to push the price up just before the sale slapped on a 25% discount that looks bigger but only brings the game down to like 55 euros instead of the usual 59 euros this kind of practice should be illegal but i believe because they added the completely arbitrary ingame dollars that you can use they can justify it if they were ever tried in a court of law a pure cashgrab that is shameful at best beyond that i have really really really enjoyed this game and it might be rockstars greatest game yet but this kind of salespractice is making me give this game a negative review i hope this will remain for all time for people to be reminded of rockstars actions it is deceptive and it is surely not illegal but by something it is silly of them

dont support rock and their crappy business practices its a shame too because the game is pretty good but they have artificially raised the price and attached immediately consumable dlc to their product during the summer sale so that you still pay full price for it but cannot get a refund thats a sleazy move and you should not support this game with your cash until r turns their act around
not recommended
they have truely angerd the people waiting for the sale so they would get the game cheaper with their attempt of skipping the sale for their own greedy needs raising the price of the game up so that when they put a 25% discount on their game it costs 3949 or something like that not cool not cool

a masterpiece thats worth the wait in a world filled with money grabbing devs useless dlcs and notorious but popular locked contents that were supposed to be part of the game was stripped away and made into season passes these practices angered a lot of avid gamers such as myself and needless to say it is revolting to see that games are being treated untruthful to the genres original roots 2015 has not been a great year for games with promising titles such as evolve dying light and for the ps4 order 1866 failing to deliver leading to disappointments for many doubts started to creep in and some suspect that even the best upcoming titles such as mgs pp and even witcher 3 might suck amidst the chaos one star shines above all its gleaming bright and pure radiance covered the sky full of light hope and dreams this star is known as rockstar gta v was originally released as a console exclusive and has received praise across the board with 1010 ratings i did not buy into the hype as i had little memory of playing gta iv 56 years ago and so i hesitated and waited suddenly rockstar decided to port it over to the pc and when i say port i didnt mean crapcoms lazy  port with missing features and bad optimizations i mean a whole new experience build from the ground up adding exclusive features implementing bugfree experience detailed pc settings that are both well optimized and greatly refined the pc version is hands down the superior and most definitive way to play gta v the story the story revolves around 3 characters allowing you to switch freely in between the characters introduced are franklin michael and trevor each individual has an interesting back story and personality with franklin growing up in the rough comptonlike neighbourhood but is fed up with all the gangbanging and killing and instead wants to turn and make honest or perhaps fast dollars leading him into the shady world of doing vehicle repossessions and eventually meet michael who is an exbank robber now retired living off of the money from his final heist wanting a peaceful life seems to be too much to ask for and as trouble always come looking for him with family on the line michael is now back in the game trevor on the other hand is michaels brother in crime and from many years of doing professional business the two formed unshakable bonds in everyday life trevor is one violent  who runs trevor enterprise a meth cooking laboratory nobody wants to mess with this psycho maniac as he will do anything to keep his business running smooth the world the state of lost santos is a recreation of modern day los angeles and it is amazingly detailed graphically beautiful and vibrant popular landmarks were represented accurately and are a wonder to look at the world and its people live and breath the same air as you do and will react to everything that has happened locally or globally which is reflected in news and radio channels the size of the world is also incredibly huge containing varies geographical locations such as downtown area desert countryside narrow mountain roads and luxurious beverly hills talking about radio channels there are hundreds of tracks available and i rarely hear repeated songs the tracks were well selected with west coast classics being my favorite channel constantly play tunes from rap icons from tupac nwa to snoop dogg and many others instantly recognizable music genres have rich varieties and there is something for everyone in addition you can import your own soundtracks into the builtin radio to create the selfradio and it can be shared and heard by friends on the passenger seats voice actinganimation the voice acting were spot on the moment you hear franklin talking with lamar each character feels realistic and packed with emotions that can be related to even the pedestrians will often talk to their loved ones or friends on the phone the animation and facial expression were on par with la noir creating the perfect balance between gameplay and storytelling gta v excels at the fact that it doesnt take itself too serious showing constant humor racial slurs and stereotypical aspects of different cultures and races it is well executed in gta v as it makes the player feel integral to the community whether you are rich or poor or the areas you live in vehicles gta v offers a huge selection of vehicles with really welldesigned handling and overall great driving mechanicscars were also smartly placed with richer areas containing more highend sports and luxury cars and other areas containing more standard commuting cars and trucks on the countryside by simply driving around you will instantly recognize audi r8 bugatti veyron porsche gt lamborghinis and ferraris the intricacies of the mechanics expand deeper when reaching out into the air as aircraft has totally different controls with some degree of learning curve and practices getting used to multiplayer gta v is not complete without its popular online multiplayer with rockstar wellprepared launch every single thing were fully functional since day one and i have not crashed once in my 50 or so hours of gameplay character creation has you choose the heritage and inheritance based on your parents to give a general outlook and an accurate template of the character which can then be customized further to become a unique representation of your online avatar but choose wisely as other characters do not share levels stats and money stored in the bank as you level up and progress the character stats you will encounter countless of activities all over the map whether you are into shootout robbery or racing theres something for everyone there are also plenty of competitive multiplayer modes to choose from standard team death match to car death match it has literally too many features and modes for me to list all here and you definitely need to play everything for yourself finally online mode introduces heist once you reach level 12 if you think payday has great heist you might need to think again because gta vs heist is definitely on another level heist has you assemble your own team and carefully selecting whos job is what and how it will be executed is the key to success each heist contains many smaller missions and these missions serve as preparation jobs once all the preparation jobs are completed you will unlock the finale of the heist a longer intense action packed and adrenaline rushing action set pieces perfectly created by rockstar it really goes to show the high production value because it is mindblowing fun after 10 failures and 1 success it makes me think i deserve that huge paycheck for hardcore players and the perfectionist heists can be replayed to allow perfect plan execution for the mastermind completing extra challenges will reward you handsomely with 80% of my play time sucked in multiplayer i have only just scratched the surface there are still tons of content i have yet to experience and tons of missions i have not played for the asking price of 3999 it is absolutely a must buy as online alone will contain hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay and in the future more may be added if you ask me should i buy gta v i say hell ing yeah the only aspect of the game i didnt like is the long loading time when transitioning from online to story mode and between screens when selecting missions but then again it is understandable considering the size of the game rockstar pays attention to details in a sandbox game with unparalleled gameplay and extremely rich content packed with a fully realized world to experience in first person mode gta v sets the standard for what an aaa game should be and likewise rockstar sets the standard to how an aaa developer should make a game 1010

campaign gta v where do i start the graphics are rather impressive even on the lowest of low settings and the highest settings are absolutely amazing rockstar have done quite a superb job on this grand theft auto although in my opinion it doesnt quite meet the standards of the classic gta iv  but its very close to meeting those standards for sure especially with the online play the campaign in my opinion seems to lack story it has quite a deverse amount of characters and situations but theres something about it that just isnt right the characters are certainly interesting and unique but niko from gta iv had more of a realistic and intriguing story compared to michael franklin & trevor in the campaign im yet to find a bug or glitch yet which is absoutely grand so good work on that rockstar i quite enjoyed doing the triathlons or playing a game of tennis with amanda it certainly did suck you into the atmosphere of los santos something of which most games lack online anyway moving onto the online play the character creation system was quite a change from most games and certainly brought a few tears to my eyes when i saw other characters from previous games but some of the characters you could create just seemed a bit unrealisitc and kind ofcrappy i feel like the online characters required a bit more facial hair options as well as more hair options the character creation & styling of your character seemed a bit restrictive it wouldve been cool to see maybe a muscle gain mechanic added to the game where you could go to the gym or maybe go for a bike ride or a run and your character is able to gain or lose weight talking about customisation the vehicle customisability is amazing there seems to be a massive amount of colours tints tires & a number of other options to choose from on all sorts of different vehicles whether it be a motor bike or a car while im still talking about customisation ill add a thing or two about the clothes in the game im not even going to lie clothing my character up is one of my favourite things to do in any game i was very impressed to see the diverse & vibrant amount of clothes that was avaliable i think ive spent at least 23 hours just clothes shopping the apartments are a very nice touch to the game as well makes it more atomspheric and calm would be cool if there was a party option where you could invite a bunch of your mates over and just get wasted & just so ed up anyway last but not least the missions in gta v onlinemost missions are quite nice and balanced surprisingly the heists are by far the best missions to do it would be nice to see more heists added eventually or even if rockstar allowed the community to create their own heists that would be even cooler the races & just general missions such as methd up are quite nice quick and enjoyable as well the only major problem i find are annoying are very minor errors such as when doing heists and you might get stuck at a certain screen or just general server problems but its expected so i cant really complain tldr pros graphics online play diverse customisability self radio large amounts of models large & interesting enviroment cats heists gun customisation smooth driving controls suits beating the  out of cats fantastic soundtrack selfies cons characters in the campaign dont have good stories minor server issues minor mission problems weird default flying controls too many characters in campaign no niko no roman no bowling but seriously you should buy this game if you meet the recommended specs its worth the money

in all honesty gta v isnt worth what i paid for it the main story was only fun when trevor was the center of attention online is a mess the interface is a mess no more heists missions but theyll release useless cars you cant even have fun in public online anymore because theres always at least 23 cheaters at any given time no one leaves you alone so you have to keep yourself in passive mode which means you cant do anyone harm so if you run into a cop you cant even shoot at them unless you leave that mode which back to the circle jerk you get harassed by the people in tanks heists theres 5 thats it missions theres only a few worth doing half of them can be done in about 510 minutes and they dont pay out anything worth noting racing forget it this is cheaters haven outside the fact the game lags like crazy so cars just fall from the sky in front of you people teleport all over the map completing a 10 minute race in 2 minutes want to level anything up you have to spend hours of pointless grinding to do stupid upgrading like strength everything you do upgrades it as such a miniscule rate you wont even see the bar move when you finally find a system that helps you lvl up rockstar patches it to make it harder to get need to upgrade strength only real way to do it is start a mission where cops arent enabled and go around punching people for hours on end or you can play over 100 matches of 9 hole golf you might get 1 full bar for that want to play online with your friends only load gtav load single player go to the menu then click on play online with friendscrew now loading mp why the hell do you have to load single player to get into a private mp instance join a mission current instance is erased loading mission mission lobby is full returning you to online loading online server timed out loading single player seriously if you think youre going to buy it and have with mp dont pay anywhere near full price for it they arent even doing anything to combat the cheaters its so rampant that youll probably end up getting banned from someone shooting bags of money at you after 80ish hoursi want my money back if you dont have an ssd to run the game off of youll spend more time loading than you will playing

this game has been in development for years they finally released it for a reasonable 5999 earlier this year the game had a budget of millions all earned back within two days of release and now they have the audacity to bump up the price just before they offer a 25% discount so they can grab 5999 off of the poor fools who had hoped that the summer sale would mean they could afford the game utterly despicable get the game from whatever retailer you can find at whatever price you deem reasonable but for the love of god dont take the 25% bait

the game has worse bugs now than it did when it was on last gen consoles the story mode is the same online is the same and the only thing they added was a video editor which most people on pc already have defaut from their graphics cards the player community that does heists is garbage for the most part its gotten to the point where no one wants to join heists you wait 30 minutes to get a full group the guy leaves then its over and you have restart through the 7 minute long loading windows and wait for a text from lester the game should be called loading simulator after years of waiting for the heist update you still make more money in the long run doing rooftop rumble or other jobs by yourself in fact instead of the whole heist update they would have been better off just bringing back the replay button for missions so you dont have to deal with the loading menus for grinding money on missions the only redeeming quality for this whole game is the modding community ive been play this game since xbox 360 initial release and thought the pc release would be something better that they would have made online mode worth playing but its still the same old grind that it used to be the game has actually gotten worse since release on xbox with all the ways they try to stop you from making money legitamately cant sell expensive cars over and over at the garage cant do missions on a playlist cant favorite missions all jobs have decreased in money earned to make way for heists etc and the hackers are more prevalent than ever going around sessions dropping millions if not billions first time i saw one i thought it was an admin with all the things they were able to do altering the entire online session and teleporting around giving money to everyone other times they go around just griefing everyone especially in jobsheists the most recent patch is a joke outfits for the price of an entire heist payout a gold jet that does nothing for 10 mil versus a hover jet in the game with rockets and explosive rounds for only 3mil a 2 mil super car that is worse than all the super cars that were in the game before that doesnt come fully armored and doesnt do anything specialonly buy this game if you want to play around in story mode with mods or if you have 3 friends that want to play heists with you on a regular basis because from the looks of it thats the only way youre going to be able to afford anything without hacking

changed the pirce of the game right before steam summer sale so it would get a little bit cheaper and if you saw that it was 25% off then you would think it would be cheap but the game is okay but from what i experienced is that online is full of cheaters so i recommend to play in friends only or invite only servers singleplayer missions are fun and you can mod the game but dont try to play with mods on servers you will most likely get banned there is no non deticated servers so you cant play with friends and mods at the same time this version of the game is actually better it runs 30  60 fps on most computers and at the same time looks nice my computer began to get old after some time so i did not expect to play this game this well in online you always need cash and to do heist you would need a high end apartment which is expensive

home to the worst multiplayer in any game i have ever played the last time i played this game i was queing for pvp battles much longer loadingwait times between matches compaired to anything else i play for shortsmall battles but ok its going along i do a couple of battles then land in a custom map yeah rockstar decided to let people use a map editor to make any kind of map they want this one had golf clubs as the only weapons except for a tank hidden off to the side that only the map creator knew how to get to after that battle i realized that to be competive in gta v online i would have to make a map and do the same thing but thats not my style and instead that was the last time i played this game there are other big problems with online too like autoaim mouse and keyboard users dont have autoaim which i though was a big improvement autoaim is a lowskill system for gaming later i found out that if you play with a controler you get autoaim and are in the same battles as people without it using mkb autoaim allows for almost instant headshots without even trying if you know how to use it so thumbs down i will say though that the offline story mode is cool it is to gta iv what san andras was to gta iii i got a few laughs out of it and might go finish it one day

its exactly the same as gta 4 just bigger and slightly shinier gta online is a complete clusterfk players getting banned for fov mods and even more players not getting banned for blatantly hacking not even fun at this point the single player is good its a big world with lots of things to shoot and drive and thats all gta really needs this game introduces stats which should be a way to have charachters with specializations but in reality ends up just being a bunch of tiresome grinding i had frequent issues with the car damage physics where the visual would rapidly flash between completely fixed and the actual state of the car gives me a headache breaks the immersion and drops framerates the pc controls are very unintuitive and i found myself needing to look back at the customize controls menu every few minutes to find out how to make my submarine decend or turn on my flashlight first person mode is inconsistent and difficult to use and frequently breaks immersion when the camera cuts to third person the game also crashes pretty frequently even on a very powerful system i74790 2x290s 16gb ram oddly the radio seems to be a large factor there because it makes your processor load shoot through the roof audio is frequently garbled or out of sync with the animations on top of all that r is being a jacka about the summer sale were being jackaes about banning online users and they even started their game off by being jackaes to pc gamers and releasing the game so much later on pc maybe in a year which would be summer sale 16 when the price drops below $30 it might be worth it for now avoid lining rs pockets for dishonest business practices and glitchy games

rockstar is a really greedy company they try to sell you money for the online mode for real cash then on top of that for the sale they jack the price up to 80$ so it discounts to the real price of 60$ sure you get a shark card for that useless online cash however with how prevalent online trainers and hacks are in their horrible online peertopeer system so everyone has billions of dollars even if you dont hack you play long enough and someone will spawn billions of dollars ontop of you whether you want them to or not  so that shark card is useless

worst game ever as rockstar just stopped mod support i bought this game for the love of mod and now rockstar not allowing it what the point of spending so much on hardware if we cant mod the game and enjoy it fully  so stupid of rs to do such a thing i regret buying should have waited and then bought waste of money online is another crap and i want to play single player with my limited internet connection every time it activates the game whcih is sick

crashes are extremely common on some systems first person mode one of the main appeals of buying this game on pc is extremely underwhelming due to terrible fov limitations which rockstar refuses to fix nor allow you to use mods for in multiplayer without the risk of being banned heists are extremely difficult maybe even impossible for the majority of player who play alone or with less than two friends hackers are extremely common in online ive been seeing them in every other lobby even after the ban waves even when someones not using a disruptive cheat theres still people shooting others with a money gun rockstar can and will even ban you or reset your money if a player shoots you with a money gun even if youre completely innocent daily objectives can be extremely hard without friends due to gamemodes such as rally races tennis etc and other activities such as impromptu races and one on one deathmatches being hard to start due to lack of players also lets not forget that rockstars being a scumbag and raising the price of the game before the sale then tying in free virtual money with the base game for $5999 the original price i was extremely excited for this game but after the hype died down theres literally no reason i should play it besides dicking around with mods in singleplayer

this game is honestly awesome the story is great gameplay is great its a great port that actually value adds from the console original its fun and funny and the heists are one of the most fun thing ive played for a long time but always online drm why rockstar the only people effected are those who buy the game on steam also raising the price right before a sale lol wot so thumbs down purely because of the crappy business stuff by r

online mode is full of bugs daily quests descriptions are incorrect crashing in heists you are often disconnected from online session when trying to connect to online session and when connect fails you are automatically loading story mode  why if i wanna play online matchmaking is another story impossible to find decent ammount of players for example rally or capture modes because you have to pick a particular mission not just any mission with type rally or capture there are way more bugs that i stated game is released 15 years on consoles so plenty of time to realize whats bad about it and release playable version on pc  you r

banning people for using singleplayer mods mods that make tiny tweaks to help players who get nauseous playing with such low fov i understand its a difficult thing to handle and yes no one wants mods in mp but to ruin peoples experience playing sp is total damnation rockstar i hope you rethink your stance as you will alienate an entire platform of gamers part of what gave gtaiv its longevity was the modding community it gave us fresh content that kept on coming even now there are new mods coming out on the other side this game is fantastic it is well optimised and a fantastic visual experience all around its just such a shame that youre trying to stifle the thing that makes your games go from great to legendary

i would not reccomend this game why this is why rockstar is a ing  rockstar changed price to 7498 right before steam summer sale so they can sell it for the same price delayed gameplay when i press w to walk it takes about 5 seconds before my character actually starts walking the same with all the other controls in the car when i press w to accelerate the car just stands there for about 10 seconds then it starts to drive when i release w the car continues for about 10 seconds sometimes when i press s to reverse in a car the car starts doing donuts i checked all my settings there is nothing wrong with the setting the game is severely flawed download i wasted several days on downloading this game to get the biggest disappointment in my whole life i was heart broken when i discovered really how bad this game was sensitivity i know you can change the sensitivity i know but in the menus i cant change the senitivity i change the sensitivity to lowest but the mouse is still ing speedy gonzales ridiculous then when i get back into the game the sensitivity is literaly the offspring of a turtle and a ing tortoise players ok yes yes this is not rockstars fault but i almost always in games with complete s i might just be unlucky i have no idea pretty much what ruins this game the most is the sensitivity and unresponsivedelayed controls i would rate this game 0100 5999 euros down the ing drain and 3 days of downloading wasted

been playing these games since vice city theyve always been fun and simultaneously stupid in the best way but this game is the first time ive ever sought a refund i had 14 hours because it works when you stay in one place but when driving the game starts stuttering terribly i bought this at the same time as witcher so i figured id resolve the issue later and just shoot at peds until then my request for a refund was denied by valve just google gta v stutter and see what cards cause the most trouble it seems gtx 660s are the most popular but ive seen some 7xx and 8xx as well as a lot of amds i play witcher 3 smoothly i play far cry 2 smoothly blacklist total war etc etc all run smooth as butter this this is disappointing ugh ive tried all the solutions i just want my money back and i think i was cursed with the fact that its around the steam sale so it looks like i just decided oo lookie i can get $60 back after playing an immense 14 hours and rent all these other games then get my money back edit tried another solution msaa to 8x was suggested lost some frames and thought the stutter was gone i was wrong the stutter persists i went against my instincts to buy a rockstar game on pc they run poorly on consoles but they run attrociously on pc it is inconceivable that a game which runs on an xbox 360 cant run with 10x the ram a superior cpu 2 gb vram etc something is wrong with this game and it needs a lot of work even alpha titles cant be released in such a state that so many people have this issue

i have few complaints about the actual game i havent played the story much on pc but ive put 90 hours into online play what i do have to complain about are the bugs crashes hackers load times etc ungodly amount of people using hacks to instakill 10 players simultaneously or spawn items that will stick to other players causing your vision to be blocked just about every other free roam game ive joined has had someone in it using these sort of trolling hacks ruining the experience for everyone with a few clicks way way way too many people are doing this leading me to believe there is litte being done to resolve this problem people are paying you for this game rockstar maintain it ive had a few crashes since i started playing which i mean is kind of expected with any pc game now a days the problem is that when the game decides to take a  it doesnt just do that but it locks up your computer forcing you to stay in fullscreen with your broken gta v luckily half the time windows will search for a solution allowing you to hit the enter key to cancel which will close the game but otherwise ive been forced to hold my power button and shut down the improper way very frustrating additionally you will almost always be lagging because it does not search by region and does not allow this option in game so youll be playing with a bunch of people in russia and china rubber banding like a mother er its not always horrible but it can really bring down the experience at times mostly when riding as a passenger oh and prepare to get run over by other players no matter where you arewhat youre doing lol i want to play this game but it shouldnt be such a chore to do so too many technical problems cant recommend edit let me also add that rockstar has taken it upon themselves to force always online measures even for the single player campaign so if you live in the country and cant keep an internet connection you cant even play this game in single player mode furthermore they have recently added an update causing almost all mods to no longer work single player and of course multiplayer so they said theyre okay with players modding their single player games but turn around and release an update that breaks their mods because theyre too lazy to separate online and offline players the anti piracy measures are making me not want to play the version i paid for but instead pirate an illegal version as it would probably be more easily modded and enjoyed from a single player point of view rockstar is a bunch of scumbag criminals as far as im concerned and are robbing everyone who buys this piece of  excuse for a game shame on you greedy little  at r never paying for another one of your games and will badmouth your company any chance i get

ive just started playing this game and i am rather impressed so far this game eats ram and i would suggest closing as much as you can before playing the missions so far are detailed and the environment is beautiful it really everything you could want from a game that wears the label of gta it is the second gta san andreas which is a game i love and one that has inspired my interest in technology & computing rockstar did a better job with the gta 5 pc port than gta iv rockstar learned their lesson well and produced something beautiful i hope one day i can create something like gta 5 something different but equally if not more beautiful in summary this game is good and it would be a unlikely that rockstar would be able to push the wall any further even assuming computer power grows some elements could be added to the game but i feel that the choices made on the game where the right ones i am not one to give 10 ratings but in the case of gta 5 there are few improvements that could possibly be made to this game 1010

coming from someone who has played the pc port of gta iv believe me this is a great port for the next instalment the price is still pretty expensive and i would recommend buying it when it drops lower unless you cant wait to hijack a military jet or you are a hardcore gta fan i would also suggest playing this with a gamepad instead of a mouse except in some instances of shooting in moving vehicles ok now time for the pros and cons pros  good balance in gameplay time and character development between the 3 characters  graphics is very good and i would strongly recommend playing it at at least high settings try limiting the drop to normal settings as it can really make a whole lot of difference  story is great and interesting except for a few loophole plots nonetheless it really got my attention most of the time and future dlcs will definitely make it better  voice acting is superb i love the voice casts in this they really suit their own characters bravo r  director mode is pretty fun its a pc exclusive and it enables the players to create their own settings there are limitations though such as dialogues etc and place characters that can be unlocked during story mode i usually use it to wreck havoc in the game lol cons  online as with many others i find it hard to play an online mission without meeting someone who uses cheat sometimes you will spend so much time looking for a party to play in and the missions ends in a blink of an eye  garage bug yup i am one of the many victims who lost their heavily upgraded vehicles in their own garage after exiting the game it doesnt happen all the time but you do get the fear of when this bug will strike next on your beloved cars all in all this game is still great on its own i would suggest gta fans to get this for neutrals maybe get at a lower price
recommended
just wow  60 bucks but so much content which wont keep me from asking for more heists though i want them  however im no fan of the dragged out and nonskippable cutscenes explanations in the heists the loading of the game or switching session takes long enough already on reasonable high end hardware 39ghz i7 ssd gtx980 few minor bugs at the moment still freezing screens while loading in heists most times fixed with 2 times alttab and sometimes gta online messes up a session
recommended
now i am not going to go all out and say best game of the year blah blah like everyone else the game is amazing but it isnt perfect like everyone says i bought gta v launch day for the ps3 played over 50 hours on it then stopped playing because other games came out and the graphics werent the greatest on ps3 neither was the fps this review can be for players that dont have top of line computers my rig cpu a8550 gpu gtx galaxy 650 ti boost ram 8gb standard 1080p monitor the game has good optimization it has problems for low end rigs like mine where the cpu hits 100% usage and causes building to not load but that isnt very often the game has errors and crashes that our related to rockstar social club client and the game itself these errors shouldnt be happening especially how many times the game was delayed and it took rockstar two years later to release the game so i understand that frustration these players are coming from that are getting those problems the game is soild story line is in my opinion the best feature online experience is great havent had a disconnect the community is so far great besides players that have transfered their characters and just killing everyone in online not that many my rating for the game 810 for sure purchase the game if you have the money it is definitely worth the buy

back in my mid 40s i had what any normal person has a midlife crisis i had an urge for adrenaline that i just couldnt get i tried joining a triathlon that didnt end well with my heart condition i tried smoking weed for the first time but nothing really happened and my whole house smelled like pizza i tried being extremely racist to black people in order for them to assault me but the only thing that happened was that they dismissed me as crazy and continued on with their day one time i remember i even tried cocaine but to no avail i simply wanted a rush an experience something that would send my heart racing yet not overboard i wanted adrenaline on a fine summer evening i walked to the grocery store to buy a pack of cigs when out of the corner of my eye i see a man in a mask with a gun he tells us all to get down on the ground or he will shoot us and skin our family alive so naturally we all got on the ground and complied with our captor my heart was racing i couldnt believe this was actually happening i went for my phone to call the police but he saw me and kept me in his crosshair for a good 15 minutes while his friend cleared the register after collecting all the money they were making their way out when suddenly a cop turns the corner of the door and aims his pistol at one of the robbers he yells freeze er and the robbers stopped in their tracks the cop told the robbers to drop their weapons and they did so the cop then yelled holy  he is resisting the criminal then started to say but i alread when the cop layed down the criminals life the other criminal stood their shocked and frightened at his fallen comrad when the cop says now its your turn bite the counter which in my opinion was an odd request the criminal listened to the officer of the law and put his teeth around the edge of the counter the hero & hunk of a police officer then said say goodnight er and proceded to stomp the black mans head in i was so amazed by what i had just witnessed all i could do was start a slow clap everyone in the store was screaming and yelling in amazement at the officers fine work it was the rush i needed it was amazing and i highly reccomend the experience

this i did not expect that i really didnt this game shows r for what they truly are a company that respects their fans it shows r in a good tone theyre not just some moneygrabbing company that doesnt give a damn about their players no theyre something more and for that i respect them back as for the game theres nothing to say really its extremely well optimized and wellmade for the pc all the graphics options are there and since today you can actually change your settings however you want to even if you have a 1gb graphics card you can play on medhigh settings with 60 fps the game had a great launch though at first i thought i wouldnt be able to play because the game started for me minimized and at a crappy resolution with most of the graphics options set to normal and off the online portion of the game is great and its extremely well made you can have up to 30 players in a lobby and still have constant 60 fps which is just ground breaking for me but ofcourse what a r launch is it without fck ups right this time thank god it was nothing major people that had their windows profiles written in other languages i think it was only russian im not quite sure couldnt launchinstall or log in to the game properly thankfuly it was fixed in a couple of hours and everyone could play now i just wanted to talk about the fun aspect of the game so here we go the game is extremely fun while played with a bunch of friends you can do anything from chasing your friends in an armed helicopter across the state or rob banks stores and so on if youre a lone wolf and you dont have any friends jk not jk d you can always make some ingame with a new chat system ofcourse the voice comms are still there and if im not mistaken they have a new codec which makes the voices even clearer so we waited we waited long enough was it worth it yes it was were the delays worth it absofkinglutely here we go my final verdict is a 910 keep in mind that it wasnt a perfect launch and that the game for some people me included is almost 25 years old if i didnt play it on the console it would have been a 1010 but i just cant undo my multiple playthroughs on the console

such astounding graphics much effort put in by rockstar to develop this game very interesting storyline so addictive im in love with this game just wow i have been a fan of gta for years and gta 5 is the best one i have ever played with rockstar spending almost 2 more years than the console version just to develop further on the pc variant basically the first thing i noticed in gta 5 is the gameplay is rather similar to skyrim but it is set in a modern era also the graphics was significantly improved from gta 4 with everything looking much more detailed all in all this is the game you will want to abandon your social life for and spend hours gaming everyday

thanks ps3 for demo

youve all read way more than your fair share of reviews on gta 5 as if its even needed but my comment goes to the 3700 haters i really dont see how anyone can have a negative review about this game its the most perfect game the best of the series and the most perfect edition of it its a sad sight to see how people can be unfair for no particular reason reflects more about themselves than anything else

well since 17042015 i was have pain in the  loading the game for 1 ing hour even it was horrible i just crashed and crashed over and over again and on graphics only thing that i can see is squares its like ing minecraft 2 as party buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut its kinda fun to play if you play with your close friends you have so much fun without doing exactly nothing just sitting even when we come to phone or tvs they are actually animations and shows just like real life but serously watch out watching these when i was exactly doing nothing but watching suddenly a woman voice sayed windmills kills birds and we shouldnt save energy and bla bla bla when i hear this i was like wtf then how solar panels kills the birds if a 6 years girlboy hear this he probaly turn into those who dont care about forests and the world so please i know its kinda funny you some of you think but serously dont even think about this well another thing we can say is its kinda too much unrealastic beacuse of the fps for sure and i dont even care about 60 gb i cant even say something but some of you say even 10 gb is too much how we gonna download 60 gb oww well  you then we are not in a world that tech is too further if its easy to fit a game like gta 5 in 1 gb go and make your own  game second of all game is the best game ever we can count graphics if you have great computer that can carry on gta 5 game modes and many many more but you know people just can die from 1 single pistol shot no matter what im not counting those who has great strengh and does sports all the time they can die with 34 shots even if they are not wearing and armor but in this game you just fist fight each other and they just die from sprint and hit like you ran and punch them in the face they just die not even 5% blood comes out and they just die from pain or what and when we come to guns if you are away from them like 10m just shot over 5 times they wont die civils they have and invisble armor or what when we come to cops they die from 3 bullets on headshot and over 13 times with body shot now wow even a real life cop can die from a 5 shots if they are wearing great armor now for the biggest thing of all for me graphics  710 shoting  1010 characters single 110 lester why i even counting him 1010 multiplayer in a server with troll players  11000000000000000000000000000000  no friends server  910 freaking characters on multi  810 easter eggs  610 i didnt like those easter eggs much missions  110 heists much more better atleast has a adrenaline  1010 6290 not counting multi  that game is playable for me

i dont even know where to start this game is a huge improvement from gta iv there is so much to do in this game that you cant get bored i was playing on ps3 and ps4 before this and i can say this is worth the wait the hype was real before the game was released and still is even after the release i was waiting for pc version since 2011 if you are a console gamer there is nothing to argue you cant beat the pc version 60fps max graphics no problem on any modern pc 3 playable characters  michael franklin and trevor the idea of 3 playable characters was really smart i cant imagine gta v without that i do not want to say anything about the story play it  everyone who is reading this  buy the game and support r  if you ever get bored you should try rockstar editor as well as director mode its hard but worth the while you cant just explain this game in words good job rockstar games  1010

i preordered grand theft auto v back in 2013 for the xbox 360 and i preordered it for the pc this year and i dont regret buying it i played the console version of this game and it was incredible loved the storyline the features the online mode everything even though i hate playing on consoles i played it few minutes after the game release a long with my buddy i was the first few thousands to launch this game i played the game its incredible go buy it do it exploring san andreas in 60 frames per second in high resolution feels wonderful what youre still reading what are you doing here go buy the game
recommended
4 hours on single player and 4 on multiplayer so far fantastic entry into the gta series stable performance normal settings with an nvidia 560 though planning to upgrade to shorten loading times gameplay and controls are top notch gta ivs floaty character controls and sloppy boatlike slippery driving are gone controls have been well made for both keyboard and controller alike logitech f710 though flying is a bit rough on the keyboard only issues i notice are loading times again old video card cpu dependent with a rather nasty cpu intensive spike whenever one is viewing a cutscene or in an interior i5 2500k sb 330ghz an odd issue where the game minimized whenever i attempted to use full screen mode this was after 8 solid hours of gameplay
recommended
this game is a huge upragde of the console version but it also got a few downsides pros faster loading screen better graphics good standard controls millions of hours in playtime until you get tired heists which you can replay races apartments good flying controls almost bug free and i could do this forever cons bad community shooting everyone a little harder in heists not really much bad stuff its worth the 60 euro just buy it damnit

many people usually ask if gta v is worth it well if your pc is decent and you know for sure that your pc can handle this game then its definetely worth it i started single player thought that this is great then i tried online before even getting 3rd character in sp and i dont want to go back to single player game anymore i cant comment about pros and cons but i personally think this game is worth the money to play online
recommended
its definitely worth buying this game the game is great theres a lot of activities i encountered only 12 bugs the game is perfect 1010 but the mp side has more bugs but the game is playable 910

after alot of messing around i have now got the game running im sure this will be patched for others who was suffering the problem of the game crashign before even opening yes this game is fantastic the graphics are great the atmosphere in whole is brilliant in terms of optimization its pretty good a hell of a lot better than the previous gta that was on pc the only thing i seem to encounter on occasion is a stutter which doesnt seem to be hardware related as it is contantly running over 60fps and the stutter irons itself out fairly quickly again im sure with a future patch or two from rockstar this will be resolved

lf a girlfriend message me detailshobbies best game of its genre no doubt if you enjoyed the other gtas then this is a must get even tho its been out for a while now on console but now its on pc bring in the mods ps gta4 was kinda dumb except for its graphics and next gen physics and stuff for its time in other words it didnt really have much contentthings to do but storyline and such gta5 is that but on roids and full of things to doooo
recommended
thirty frames forget it we give you twice the frames of thirty
recommended
great story line funny too about the multiplayer though there are stuff that i think that should be added to the game or more likely removed well i believe that most players would agree that the fact that you can basically see the location of your enemy on the minimap kinda ruins the element of surprise i think if you could only know the location of your teammates that would be really great d but overall gta v went into my top 5 games list pretty fcking quick hehe
recommended
everyone knows that gta v is a great game so ill just get down to how i feel about the port rockstar learned from their mistakes with gta iv the pc port of gta v performs above and beyond my expectations i was not expecting to get 1080p 60pfs at high settings with midtier hardware from 2012 and yet i am there are plenty of graphic options available to scale your visuals and performance to meet your needs there are an exhaustive amount of options available for key rebinding mouse input controller support just about everything one would expect out of a decent port tldr its a way better port than gta iv so 1010
recommended
after playing gta v i never turn on gta iv again
recommended
19 months since the game was released initially that version was amazing 6 months since the game was rereleased for the next gen consoles that version was even better 2 days since the game was remastered for pc this is the best version and always will be rockstar put a lot of time and effort into this port and it shows huge texture size masses of video settings and the best visual experience to date thanks rockstar im loving this

recommended
played it on xbox360  decent pc  better way better transferring my character was a bonus  loyalty content an added bonus performance is good tbh with hardly no lag or fps drops if youve never played it get it its worth it if you played it before on console and wasnt too keen on it you might as well get it as mods should hopefully add things in if you know your pc wont be able to run it save yourself the 40 but if your pc can handle it have fun

two years of waiting since the console release gta v has arrived on pc and it is spectacular i wasnt sure what to expect when i hopped onto this game since i havent touch anything from the series since san andreas but i have no qualms about the direction the game has taken the story is amazing three different dudes with a singular interconnected storyline that involves the three of them together as well as smaller subplots to each character each character follows a story that involves some major character development along the way the writing in the characters are solid too each has their unique origins opinions everything supporting characters to side quests labelled as strangers and freaks ingame are pretty nicely done too ranging from the bumbling papparazzi photographer beverly to cletus the roadkill obsessed redneck to the toking libertarian barry  most have rather unusual requests but entertaining the addition of random events occuring in the game helps spice up the mood a little you can intercept a robbery help as the escape driver to one escort partygoers home etc heists are the big game in this title  the three main characters storylines usually converge on large scale heists stealing a nuke from a private military group for one that involve preplanning and setup missions with both loud or quiet options and additional crew members that affect how the heist goes both quiet or loud options have different approaches and crew members required both are quite eventful in terms of action pretty much none of the missions in the last few games can top the kind of action and writing put into these each heist pays out a rather large sum of money which can be spent upon completion of the heists this is by far the best way to earn money in the game music in the game is fantastic they have a rock and pop channel that just literally gives me the greatest nostalgic feelings the more modern channels also have excellent electronic music rap and a channel for classic rap too theres also a channel for country music if youre into that sort of thing the graphics on this game are simply amazing the way the characters and objects move the physics of moving vehicles textures on objects not to mention the optimization is pretty well tuned as of writing this review im using an nvidia gts 450 and the game runs medium graphics at a decent fps rate of 50 and it doesnt look terrible the return to and remodelling of los santos was one of the things i liked the most about this game you see a lot of features around the place that remind you of gtasa and i think thats great you can also trip out on peyote and become a cat thats neat customization for guns and cars are pretty much the same from last time though save for the addition of camos for guns and few miscellaneous options for cars maybe a little better but not a radical change from the last game i played clothing customizations are pretty neat too each character has access to the common clothes that all three of them can wear and other clothing items that are unique to them hairstyles and beards are a little lacking each character has about <5 to pick from at each barber unlike the vast variety of options applicable to cj ala san andreas earning money is a little scarce outside of heists most missions dont even award you with anything beyond storyline progression a measly reward occassionally and opening up other side quests options to earn money from activities outside the story are few and far in between and dont dish out a whole lot gta onlines integration into the game was a big thing everyone looked forward to the introduction is pretty cool you begin customizing your character in a lockup get released from prison and fly into los santos meet yuh boy l d get thrown into a sedan class race and at the conclusion of the race you are allowed to keep whatever car you ended the race in however there are probably other better options available to steal to make your own you may also purchase high end cars and other expensive cars through the phones online browser too and there are a wide variety to pick from the heists in gta online require more complicated setups but the finales are more run and guns than the heists in the story something i find a bit disappointing also they all end up loud so the stealth featureskill is pretty much useless the payouts for the heists are rather substantial items in online are double the price they are in the story however and unlock a variety of items to use in freeroam and other missions however all this aside unless you are performing activities or heists with friends there isnt much else to do in onlines freeroam besides waging war on random players the police or robbing convenience stores heists also have little to no other checkpoints beyond a checkpoint right outside the objective location which you will spawn at when you fail and restart heists will also fail immediately if a player disconnectsdies at any point of a heist leading to the cancellation of the heist altogether one of the most frustrating features while on a heist is the fact that teammates can hurt and kill each other leaving griefing a very real option i think the kicker for this all is that half the time you spend on gta online will be staring at a loading screen tldr gta v has an amazing story features music and graphics you can get high and turn into random animals side quests are pretty interesting and unique gta online gets old after a while maybe really quick not much else interesting to do on gta online besides heists races and some pvp activities integration of rockstar social club isnt as annoying as i last remember
recommended
awesome game once you get to play it demanding in specs if you want it to be pretty but if you gang up with your friends its a really awesome experience i killed 26hours of potential homework time for a paper just to play the hell out of this and the recovery for multiplayer was very fast for this game

best rockstar optimization so far i couldnt stay away from this game for a few weeks now i liked the story the gameplay the everything i guess there are a few problems with online here and there but this is one of my favorite games of all time was it worth the wait for the pc version yes it definitely was at least for me i truly think that this game is a straight upgrade from gta iv although i imagine some of you getting all angry at me and saying that im wrong but this is just my opinion which you can happily ignore also please ignore most of the negative reviews as they are just whiners not judging the game itself and only raging over the developers actions which were lied about in the first place either that or somebody whining that their 10 year old pc cant run this game

its late at night the store owner cleans the counter down  its quiet hes got time the bell rings a customer enters the shop keeper looks up and says hello the customer says nothing walks up to the counter and browses the confectionery blankly the customer pockets several ps & qs leading to the shopkeeper to yell in alarm without a change in heart rate or facial expression the customer scales the counter and proceeds to savagely boot the shopkeeper in the face jumping off the customer stabs the shopkeeper to death and takes all of the money from the till the customer swaggers from behind the counter and casually strolls outside a police car rounds the corner drifting easily into the gas station where the crime was committed however the officers slightly overshot the corner and careened into a petrol pump the officers the customer and the shopkeepers brutalised corpse are blown to smithereens 1010

people say the online part of the game is boring considering the story mode let me say you this after completing the prologue i thought i wanted to check the online mode a bit and maybe create a charater just for fun now i cant leave online mode its great even the worse part of the game is incredibly fun and addictive man this is going to be a long ride regarding to the performance i know that the game kind of buggy on some systems but i have faith in rockstar that they will fix it eventually maybe not in a fast way though its running on my system beautifully even i dont have a highend rig and playing with ok graphic settings its a nice game to look at i can probably continue this for pages so im just gonna leave it like thisyou get the idea anyways

its gta d can only be good ^^

i was waiting this game for a years finally when ive bought it in january i got extra gift gta san andreas  1000000$ in cash for online and 500000$ in cash for offline mode the best game ever they can say what they want but this game is absolutely the best works perfectly on quadcore 34 ghz 8gb ram and 1gb ddr5 pcie 30 graphics

if you dont know what gta is then youve been avoiding all forms of media for the last 15 years or so or you are too young to be playing it in the first place at this point a review would be pointless the best pc version rockstar has ever released of the gta series as of yet yeah there is some bugsissues but compared to the problems with the last pc gta released gta iv this one of pretty good straight out of the box if you like gta and you have a decent enough pc then get it
recommended
god i ing hate this game completely lost all social connections because of it just kidding i never had a social life to begin with now seriously i have a fairly old computer asus gh73j the specs arent very good but gta is so well optimized i run at a constant 60fps its amazing there are a few random crashes for instance i was in firstperson and my mate punched me instant crash some random crashes such as that will occur but nonetheless it is definietly worth the time and money that is required in a game like this i rate a 910 once the patches fix all the bugs if thats possible itll be a solid 1010 rockstar done did good
recommended
perfectly optimized for pc well worth the wait and well worth the full price
recommended
im rich  whoooores10
recommended
edit i have a dream that some day rockstar will give us gta v for pc and let us mod it martin luther king gameplay 810 the game is good the graphics are well polished but still has a little of stuttering that can be fixed in the next patch optimization is ok not too much as max payne 3 but still is good in these days

no more need for friends family or pets my virtual life has finally gone sentient farewell outernet you sucked anyway

really nice done graphics and details the gameplay feels awesome youre gonna learn fluent american dialect with all the profanity in the english 1110 would steal a random car form the road and break it again

this game is absolutely gorgeous on pc no major problems running the game besides a few minor frame drops here and there played on 360 and ps4 but neither of them compare to this it felt longer waiting for this game to come out but now that its finally here we can all relax and enjoy this beautiful masterpiece theres no more to be said time to go back to killing pedestrians and drooling over the new san andreas if you love the gta series then you need this game asap 1010
recommended
this game is everything we all expected it to be i know alot of people who are haveing issues playing this game from all over the world and on all different types of pc builds so it is kind of a gamble as to where it might work for you or it might not apart from a few crashes and unable to find rockstar files errors mine has been pretty good running and i can handle the little issues if it means i can play this awsome game 100% recommend but you need to be aware that it does not work smooth for everyone and it is possible you could be spending hours on hours googling fixeslol
recommended
hell i could be going on a heist with my buddies right now but im too focused on chasing cats and hitting them wtf

meow meow meow meow awsome game
recommended
sandbox game with a take it or leaveit storyline and lots of city to explore it departed from the locked areas of the map that that previous games had everything is explorable from the minute you are able to walk the streets the storyline is very impressive you have three very distinct personalities involved in the form of trevor a sociopath with anger issues michael the professional bank robber with family issues franklin the illiterate gangbanger trying to make it big great visuals and graphics if your rig can handle it there were some folks having issues along with buttersmooth gameplay and 60 fps throughout the entire game again depends on your rig of course sound the usual station selections are here along with some new ones the absence of the funny commercials is really obvious to me but i actually liked them gameplay the only issue i can say i had with the gameplay was the fact that the driving engine still needs some work its worlds better than gta iv but still nothing compared to the sr series sometimes you hit a curb and keep your grip othertimes you hit the same curb and end up getting rolled 20 times there doesnt seem to be much consistency with it shooting its not what i would say tight unless youre using the mouse and keyboard i found it to be very forgiving as far as distance shots and headshots probably to compensate for the fact that most people use a gamepad for a game like this some cons in a game that revolves around driving youd think there would be an easier way to get your cars or at least be able to use them but if you do any mission that you drove up to in your custom vehicle its gone it might some of the time end up in the impound but about half the time its just plain gone the only real vehicle you have that is consistent is the default one so dont waste your money at the beginning of the game souping up an infernus you jacked theres really no point even when you get a place to store your vehicles you still have to take a cab to get them out of the garage and if you lose it in the water or get it blown up its gone for good also the other thing i didnt quite understand was the fact that the hang out function of the game seemed to be just thrown together and didnt really have a purpose nor does it integrate into the storyline i was at a portion of the game where michael and trevor hated each other one of the many and yet i called him to hang out and took him to a bar played tennis etc and they acted like best buddies all in all its a good game i wouldnt say there is lots to do beyond the main missions the focus seems to be just getting through the game and then trying out the online version of the game there arent even any endgame unlocks or interesting things to do beyond one mission for trevor so id give it 910 for the game overall 9510 for the graphics and attention to detail for small things you may never notice but do appreciate when you see them and once you win the game for the first time you owe it to yourself to replay the first few missions to see how the three of them had their stories intertwined even before you really knew who they were

best game ever 1010 i love it

i was supposed to be studying this period then this came out jokes on youresponsibilities 1010
recommended
an absolutely amazing game the port was amazingly done the graphics are just amazing and the controls are easy to get used to which is what i feared the most a wide variety of computers are able to run the game which is why they made the game delayed for many months they fitted the game with all sorts of things that would help people run the game even on toaster computers the gameplay is designed so that you would be able to spend whole days on end completing missions for npcs and the story itself is quite long as for online its amazing what rockstar did with it sadly there is no coop campaign but instead you can live and roam los santosblaine county as any type of person youd be i suspect there to be quite a lot of roleplaying although more people would rather kill each other like the sociopaths they all are ingame a great option that i love seeing in online is that i can transfer my character directly from previous versions of the game ps3 ps4 xb360 xb1 and retain all of the stuff that i had on him you can also have the option to edit hisher appearance one more time if you dont feel comfortable with the way he looks overall score 1110 would buy again

the pc version of gta v is definitely the best version i was waiting for pc version really long but i am ok with that the game finally came out in a fantastic state rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the pc portversion im usually against preordering games but i made one exception this year for gta and im happy with my decision i did it for the preorder bonus because i know it how long i will work for that money i was playing on ps3 one year also i did it just for preload all gbs in time for launch because the game is ridiculously big well done rockstar this is the best pc version you have ever made and i can see that you put a lot of effort time and love into creating it aleready i have 60h paying with friends and there will be much more that game should be no1 of the year 2015 pc
recommended
the game plays fine for me about 80 fps average a few fps drops here and there but thats cause the lots of graphics they include my specs monitor asus 27 144hz 3d monitor vg278he graphics gtx 780ti inno3d herculez case corsair 760t white mb asus maximus vii ranger psu evga 1300w g2 cpu intel core i7  4770k 39ghz cpu cooler corsair h110i ram 16gb  2133mhz hdd 2x lacie minimus 2tb aluminum ssd corsair 240gb force ls

ive played every gta since the top down grand theft way back when gtav has to be my favourite of all of them 2 years ago i played it on x360 and i didnt hesistate to purchase it again for pc the pc version is of course the definitive version it scales excellently to any system components the graphics are incredibly sharp and beautiful and the online with first person and mousekb support is a must play all we can hope for is continued support for it from rockstar please dont forget about us r i hope weve shown you that we will support you now that the game is out please continue to support us fix those bugs add those dlcs improve those servers and well let the world know what a great job youve done thanks

recommended
its meh but no seriously this has to be one of if not the best rockstar title out there as well as the best gta title in terms of gameplay story and graphics performance the game runs pretty well on my rig evga gtx 660 amd fx6300 8gb of ram staying at a pretty constant 3060fps which im perfectly fine with with mostall settings on high final thoughts i seriously recommend getting this game if youre interested in getting a title in the gta franchise or a big open world game with tons to do 1010 would commit gta again
recommended
bought this for xbox 360 bought this for ps4 bought this for pc twice one for younger brother one for me didnt even get thanked for paying 160 combined on this one single game 1110 would buy four more times

recommended
great game runs well best story sp mode i have played in a while fun multiplayer with friends
recommended
the only game ive bought in 3 years that was worth the money and i have almost 400 games buy it now seriously
recommended
this review isnt taking into account the 530 extra days that rockstar had to make this  essentially im reviewing it as if it just came out compared to many other game developers and how they deal when the game is out for the first few hours i have to say rockstar did well by far at least for me it was one of the smoothest launches ever only taking about 20 minutes to decrypt the preloaded files and at about 730 i logged in to social club and was playing within minutes for me there werent any big technical issues that i could see although i had a few friends who experienced some buggy lines around their character the game runs smooth and is very well optimized along with having a myriad of settings to appeal to either high end gaming pcs or a laptop it has reccommended settings for your pc and has a tool that shows you how much vram you will be using when the settings are applied this feature is useful but ive noticed that you can choose to ignore the tool that stops you from applying the settings when over the suggested amount and ive gone about 500600 mbs of vram over the limit and it has still been running well not to mention the graphics look amazing a great engine paired with an original beachside city design that has had a lot of work done on it leads to a great looking game i own it on xbox 360 and ps3 and the difference is stunning when i first got into single player it made me play the prolouge i had already finished the game on console beforehand and after i finished the prolouge since i had a bunch of friends waiting for me to tell them if they could get on gta online i just pulled up the options menu and launched an online session i had the ability to transfer my charachter from either console over to the pc version and unlike the consoles on first glance the online was quite finetuned to fit the pc with no server lag lowered textures or anything as for the story  its great it features a great storyline that is based around three characters with very different stories for each and they all revolve around eachother which include humor action drama and customization everything you want in a story mode same goes for the online game mode overall this game in my opinion this is one of the best titles released ever and i feel it will stay at the top of the charts for a long while just like gta iv enjoy playing and imo it was worth the wait
recommended
some online bug but overall a super great game i spent 17 hours on the first time i launch the game lol
recommended
can see the entire map in detail at maximum draw distance 1010 made my pc gamer gland explode with delight

really like it but i have a few problems  the amount of time it takes to download is way to much and its a bum \ the social club screen crashes for me alot and i almost cant play but i really enjoy it its epic chaotic and i play it in 4k ultra settings and it looks amazing if you should buy it  yes d buy it now  no wait for the server loads to decrease and then wait for a sale ill rate it 9510 because of the a bit anoying launch \ enjoy the game d

amazing game totaly worth it

we live in a day and age where society is quick to point fingers at everything else except the actual problem every time something violent happens in the world someone somewhere instead of pin pointing the actual problem blames video games especially this one or this franchise in particular well screw that its games like this that allow us all to do some pretty fed up stuff we wouldnt normally do that keep most of us from doing violent things in real life thanks to gta im not out there banging hookers or running them over in my car im not killing random amounts of police just to see how many more will show up to try to kill me i dont run my car off the bridge to see how many barrel rolls i can do before i hit the ground or to see if i can land on the wheels and ride off in to the sunset like the mofoing badass i am seriously countless barrel rolls and landing on the wheels and driving off thats beast what up suckas try that in real life dead but i digress if you want some good cleanerr ummbad dirty dirty violent borderline psychotic fun at the end of your hard day in real life if you want something to blow off steam that wont put you in jail for acting out those road rage thoughts you had when that dill hole in the audi cut you off on the freeway during rush hour this morning if you dont want to be plastered all over the 5 oclock news and labled a psycho just cause your way of blowing off steam was a mass killing spree for no apparent reason then gta v is for you so grab this game get in there and start doing the fed up stuff you know is in your head its in there trust me i see it

wow what a game i preloaded this sometime over the weekend waiting for 414 but was released a bit earlier on the 13th ive had this game on all the generations 360 one and now pc let me tell you something i honestly looked at the trailers and pictures for the pc and thought well this doesnt look that much differnet for such a delay until i pressed play i did have the windows account error  which was an easy fix for me the game is just purely stunning and the crisp sounds of engine and rifles the story line now that is an amazment that would keep you entertained for days and days the gta online dlcs some may be bad but then you have massive ones such as gta online heists which is just spectacular this game could bring hundreds of hours of fun once you really get into it

 singleplayer review  i have played gta 5 for 15 years now on ps3 since its release on ps3 i had to wait a while before we could go on gta online so in the meantime i finished singleplayer in the first 23 days so far its the best most enjoyable crazy wack insane overthetop mindblowing and most importantly most fun i have ever had playing singleplayer once it came out on nextgen consoles i was jealous of the advantages they had but now that i have played about half of the story so far on pc my jealousy was all for nothing it feels like im playing a completely different game again from the start while ive started singleplayer over about 6 times and finished it 2 times its everything i mentioned before times 10 keep in mind i play with vsync on and get around 5060 fps with 1920x1080 and on directx10 after upgrading my pc who knows what this game will be like even thinking about that gives me chills and makes me wanna work harder to earn money faster to upgrade my pc but till then i am already experiencing bliss over and over again everytime i start this game up and play the story again while typing this im cracking the biggest smile and chills are running down my spine so enough of typing and off to playing 1010

okay so what is this game  a game where you can  carry a rocket launcher on the street with no attention  fall from 10000 feet from the sky and somehow survive  drive vehicles without refueling  get paid grands for a backflip  get shotgun in the head and live  after a street massacre and not end up on world news  break everybone in your body and some how come back alive from the hosiptal  entering a house to let the police give up chase  get overprice sex  in a car  that lasted 10 seconds  prank calls on 911 and beat up the police  rob a gun store that sold you the gun  running over innocent animals  speed on the highway and not get fined  fire a gun in your house and get busted f can i make the list longer 10  10 pc master race sucks for all you console beta testers p
recommended
ive put over 300 hours into this game on console and im excited to put hundereds more onto my record while i and several other people have had day one problems with the game this shouldnt be the reason why you dont give this game a chance the story is great multiplayer is a blast and really the whole game is a masterpiece at least i think so while several people think that this game is not worth $60 because it is a 15 year old game i feel as if the game should be worth more thank god it isnt with hundereds of hours of content i dont see why you wouldnt get this game

amazing pc port  runs butter smooth @ 1920x1080 on my gtx 970 with almost all the bells and whistles turned on and it does offer a huge variety of video options the graphical fidelity is outstanding esp for an open world game i am very happy they didnt dumb it down unlike so many other contemporary pc ports beware of the  60 gb download  hard disc space requirement though the game also seems to be using up almost all of my 4096 mb video memory so if you have a mid range pc i suggest disabling anti aliasing and turning the texture quality sliders down a notch to ensure smooth gameplay im not even gonna waste time reviewing the actual gameplaystoryline as this game has been out on consoles for almost 2 years now but for us pc players it was certainly worth the wait brb overclocking my gpu so i can crank up the msaa even more  justmasterracethings

just awesome its a musthave to play it even playing the online version visuals are so realistic i cant believe what itll be with a mod that enhances it even farther i would recommend all my friends to buy and play this game it is worth it thisll be the next skyrim if mods ever come out i cant wait for those mods best game ive ever played in a really long time the storyline of gta v is awesome and hilarious at the same time gta online is even better when you play with your friends the downside of this is some players that are in the session may just come and murder you for no reason i was able to defend myself back so many times but due to me just killing random civilians and hunting down bounties my mental state in statistics considers me as a psychopath but i think gta online is a better experience unless it comes down making an archenemy gta online is great when you rank up through missions and heists and people wont be able to mess with you if youre ranked high enough the game is inexplainable in general in gta online i just blow stuff up 360 noscope players that tries to kill me and make los santos my world 1110

this review isnt taking into account the 530 extra days that rockstar had to make this  essentially im reviewing it as if it just came out compared to many other game developers and how they deal when the game is out for the first few hours i have to say rockstar did well by far at least for me it was one of the smoothest launches ever only taking about 20 minutes to decrypt the preloaded files and at about 730 i logged in to social club and was playing within minutes for me there werent any big technical issues that i could see although i had a few friends who experienced some buggy lines around their character the game runs smooth and is very well optimized along with having a myriad of settings to appeal to either high end gaming pcs or a laptop it has reccommended settings for your pc and has a tool that shows you how much vram you will be using when the settings are applied this feature is useful but ive noticed that you can choose to ignore the tool that stops you from applying the settings when over the suggested amount and ive gone about 500600 mbs of vram over the limit and it has still been running well not to mention the graphics look amazing a great engine paired with an original beachside city design that has had a lot of work done on it leads to a great looking game i own it on xbox 360 and ps3 and the difference is stunning when i first got into single player it made me play the prolouge i had already finished the game on console beforehand and after i finished the prolouge since i had a bunch of friends waiting for me to tell them if they could get on gta online i just pulled up the options menu and launched an online session i had the ability to transfer my charachter from either console over to the pc version and unlike the consoles on first glance the online was quite finetuned to fit the pc with no server lag lowered textures or anything as for the story  its great it features a great storyline that is based around three characters with very different stories for each and they all revolve around eachother which include humor action drama and customization everything you want in a story mode same goes for the online game mode overall this game in my opinion this is one of the best titles released ever and i feel it will stay at the top of the charts for a long while just like gta iv enjoy playing and imo it was worth the wait

some online bug but overall a super great game i spent 17 hours on the first time i launch the game lol

ah yes grand theft auto v the game weve been waiting for to be ported onto pc for over a year now my main concern was going to be the pc port thankfully rockstar managed to pull off a fantastic pc port for a game that looks downright beautiful even on my 840m the game looks and runs beautiful the gameplay itself is the best in any openworld game ive played yet shooting running from cops and even a good first impression the one thing i would say from the gameplay that im not very impressed about are the car physics with the sports cars while i love crashing into things and seeing my car about to flip over the car physics involving the sports cars while drifting just seem out of whack in my personal opinion besides that the car physics with the other vehicles are fantastic besides the car physics the game is a blast to play on pc my focus on the sound design would be that the sounds in the game do sound realistic especially the car sounds the design of the sounds in the game sound beautiful especially when you have a great sound card i would highly recommend getting it for pc if your computer matches the requirments i will continue to update this review as soon as i get further into the game enjoy your experience edit my desktop is now done with upgrades im playing this game with an i74770k and a geforce gtx titan x for windows 7 users there will be some annoying issues with stuttering even with highend desktops like mine just to inform you if you are a windows 7 user be careful with the game settings due to game stutter when you have vsync on still without vsync on the game runs great update im now finally playing gta v online and me and quite a few friends have been witnessing ingame crashes i have a gtx titan x not even running the game on maximum settings at 1080p and it crashes one of my friends has a gtx 780ti and his game frequently crashes also im just warning you guys who are planning to purchase the game about the issues going on with the online portion havent experienced any crashes with the singleplayer yet
recommended
played all 3 versions of this game the pc version is by far the definitive version the landscapes are beautiful with great detail from the busy city to the quiet mountains great gameplay from single player to online youll be having a blast highly recommend this game
recommended
hey rockstar didnt screw up gta v like they did with gta iv optimiztion is good
recommended
wow what a game i preloaded this sometime over the weekend waiting for 414 but was released a bit earlier on the 13th ive had this game on all the generations 360 one and now pc let me tell you something i honestly looked at the trailers and pictures for the pc and thought well this doesnt look that much differnet for such a delay until i pressed play i did have the windows account error  which was an easy fix for me the game is just purely stunning and the crisp sounds of engine and rifles the story line now that is an amazment that would keep you entertained for days and days the gta online dlcs some may be bad but then you have massive ones such as gta online heists which is just spectacular this game could bring hundreds of hours of fun once you really get into it
recommended
great game super fun this game is a must buy
recommended
even a potato could run this at max settings with at least 40 fps
recommended
you can get stoned on the couch and watch tv all in 4k resolution 420420 would play again

grand theft auto v is the ingaround simulator of 2013 theres a lot of ingaround simulators set in sandboxes but theres none quite with the same hallowed recognition and flair that grand theft auto possesses its unevenly designed see the ing ui re it being garbage beyond figuring out waypoints padded as  to fill out a 40hour game time thats only if you do the main missions and little else in between and the game itself feels welldetailed and alive and somehow at the same time feeling like computer people existing in a computer environment now that its 2015 its finally out on the pc and it has new content for its multiplayer platform unfortunately for rockstar i dont give a  about grand theft autos multiplayer mode if i wanted to play a multiplayer grand theft auto id just buy a box of surplus grenades from my local neonazi and huck them at passing cars during rush hour despite the tonguelashing i gave the game i like grand theft auto 5 i like it a  of a lot more than i liked grand theft auto 4 which managed to tap me out through a combination of awful writing ancillary  and not being able to shoot roman in the face when he begs me to take him bowling oh dont worry  there is so much ing around you can do here from golf to taxi driving to underwater deep sea diving to fighting with other s on the steam discussion forums on whether claude speed is still canon in gta or not but if you want to just dig deep into the miserable lives of three s looking for scratch so you can get into all the awesome multistage heists to pull off for sweet dollars and sweeter gamer cred you can do that too and ignore everything else now that ive validated your opinion on this video game i am going to say mean things about the writing if you dont care about the writing of grand theft auto please do not reveal the spoiler tag pretend im talking about cheeseburgers or something i think the writing of gta 5 is highly uneven sure rockstar are taking bold leaps forward by having three main characters with wildly different lifestyles and circles of friends and that is something to applaud i want to see rockstar do some wiretype  with many main characters but they have to overcome their hurdles first i think largely i was tired of gta 5s satirization because i know what theyre getting at i just dont find it funny anymore and it think it has more to do with haha lol political satire rofl topical humor  and  rofl than it has to do with the lack of attempt of actual satirization the game is kind of really misogynist and i dont know whether thats an intentional choice or whether it escaped the glaucomaridden panopticon of satire that the writers tried to create im betting on the latter the torture mission sucked and i told the game to go  itself when it was over the main characters are fun and occasionally have actual human emotional moments but their characters kind of fall apart towards the middle part of the game and are driven by the overwritten 80s action movie plot that you can either wrap up neatly or not its all shoddy writing masked by excellent world detail and voice acting performances and i hope rockstar ups their writing game for the next time around anyway bacon cheddar burgers are delicious you should go buy one

pretty good game huge campaign with three different protagonists plus a massive amount of side content and things to do like golfing and skydiving and riding bikes some things specifically aircraft and the submarine and bicycles have terrible mouse and keyboard controls  so keep a controller plugged in and switch to that when you get in those vehicles or any vehicle really story its pretty generic and average the dialogue and performances are all pretty spectacular though additionally the character trevor is probably the most tryhard edgy  character that i have ever seen in a video game and i cant see why people like him as a supporting role hes great but as a main playable character rockstar ed up michaels pretty whiny too franklin seems like they actually put effort into him so no complaints there the endings are all terrible too it also has a multiplayer mode and its certainly great if you enjoy games with terrible character creators bad communities annoying messages and popups and a ton of grinding  despite the flaws in the writing and the mistake of a multiplayer its still a solid game and i dont really regret my preorder its undoubtedly worth the money spent it also runs great and looks great and has content that other versions of the game do not such as the lab fm pick it up when you get the chance especially if youre a fan of the franchise edit i should note there is alwaysonline drm for singleplayer and multiplayer and the unskippable startup video is ridiculously long
recommended
great game regarding online though be warned take screenshots of your stuff game definitely has glitches and rockstar wont give you back your stuff if you cant prove it even after sending gamefiles that should of done so other then that awesome game great with friends having a headset helps some of the heists would be impossible without communication im hoping the consoles dont slow this games progress down they still have plenty of room for more contact after doing the same missions over and over for that 20k makes you want some new ones
recommended
perfect game everything is good no lags only have a strugle at the start because in order to play i need to disable my video card at first

one of the best games of the decade really fun with a great port amazing story and singleplayer mode with a multiplayer mode that is not as good as single player but still really fun and has a lot of depth and things to do great port but a lot of people have problems with it there are solutions for most of them r really did a great job with the port and i was really scared this game wouldnt run on my crap pc glad it does worth a purchase at full price
recommended
the game is very hard to start takes some fooling around and searching up online to find some sort of temp fix but when the game launches its as smooth as a babys bottom the game is optimized well and no where near where gta 4 was hopefully in a week or so rockstar release the patch for the crashing while loading up the game im not going to give it a negative review because the gameplay works perfectly

im sure everybody already knows this is a great game and is more than worth the price lets take a minute to take a look at the port optimization it is nicely optimized i have seen games run better but i runs good enough i have an athlon760k  r7 260x  8gb ddr3 ram and this game runs okay the game runs better in onlinei will elaborate later what im saying applies to online i can have graphics medium with almost no pp and it runs pretty well when casually driving around and in gunfights it works quite well the only problem i have found is when i am racing or flying low my cpu maxes out i will get frame drops therefore i cant do races i loved races on xbox360 so this is really sad for me other than that it runs really well 6045 fps in single player because all the loading of ai is done locally instead of through internet my gpu is still fine normally but the moment i start driving or really doing anything besides standing normal slow stuff my cpu maxes i can have gunfights and drive around at like 45mph tops and it is quite annoying so single player is not very playable for me it is fun to mess around with mods but if they are like speed mods for cars i am sure you can guess how they work but in the end this is a great game and i would recommend any day
recommended
a great port well optimised good looking and first person drivingflying is very fun
recommended
after almost two days of game time i have game to the conclusion that this game cant be beaten the graphices are insane even on normal my fps isnt the best because i have a hd 4000 graphics card but the game is still playable so i rate 88 ign
recommended
having already played this on both xbox 360 and xbox one and putting in a combined total of about 200 hours this was already a guaranteed purchase and i must say rockstar have outdone themselves with this pc release coming from the atrocity that was the gta iv pc port i was extremely skeptical of their release of gta v and if like me were hesitent on it as well put your fears to rest  consistent 60 fps on high settings with not a sign of drop stutter or lag  online servers seem to be running perfectly fine something that couldnt be said when released on xbox 360ps3  extremely optimized and a bevy of graphical options to change and enhance  one of the greatest openworld games to come out in the past several years is finally on pc  modding support and pcexclusive rockstar editor will allow for a lot of replayability in the future all in all rockstar have outdone themselves and this is probably their best release to date
recommended
gta v has proven theres still hope for well optimized triple a pc ports it can run well on most machines and definitely plays well too gtas only flaws come from its naturally clunky controls but otherwise its worth every penny for this excellent pc port

no matter what these steam reviews say about the pc portor any other reviews people give about this game nothing can stop people from buying it the pros weigh more than the cons nothing can prevent people from buying this not even rockstars dumb moves its just that fun

best singleplayer story ever i played legendary game physical features graphics put beautiful perspective for this game and tradition have been staying same since 1990s typical grand theft auto game my top three game however two disadvantages of this game are sometimes it can be boring in online due to time of loading scenes and price is quiet expensive so sexy game a masterpiece my friend 
recommended
very good finally able to play with friends d i enjoyed online a lot more on here than on consol yus
recommended
this game like many many others is not without its online issues trouble with getting connected staying in lobbies and with its latest release quite some lag i have no doubt that will be resolved soon enough that said this game is a marvel of modern gaming its rich with content and beautiful to look at make friends quick and enemies faster and do so in a huge and extremely detailed open world environment there is nothing that compares to this game in terms of complexity
recommended
puts other openworld games made in the same fashion to shame one of the best big budget games released this decade with both a great singleplayer story & online multiplayer that is a lot of fun this is the quintessential version of gta 5 shark cards are a bit  though

this game is so much better than what i was expecting the online portion was already working a few hours after the release its greatly optimized and the control scheme is wonderful the driving and flying is seemless as long as you know all the controls first this is definetly the ultimate edition of grand theft auto 5 and i dont think ill stop playing it any time soon
recommended
alright so really really good port feels almost native to pc beautiful visuals fun overall gameplay story is good a bit anticlimatic but good missions aplenty a ton of things to do aside from story missions big open & detailed world wish it included the rest of the original san andreas though ability to play as 3 main characters instead of 1 story characters are interesting & detailed singleplayer & multiplayer overlap a bit first person mode which is detailed & pretty rad buuuut sadly falls short due to really poor fov options awkward camera handling when doing more physical stuff poor camera placement in vehicles etc pretty damn casual compared to previous gtas in almost every way r decided to exclude a lot of great features of previous gtas like gyms relationships resturantsfood bowling etc which makes the world feel a bit less interactive nonessential npc interactions are lackluster compared to gta iv online is very badly balanced on just about all fronts trust me on this one online uses peer2peer which introduces a lot of issues like instability extremely easy to hack sync problems etc online is fairly wonky with a decent amount of crashing server imploding infinite loading bugs etc online takes a ridonk amount of time to load in feels like im waiting for my ps1 whenever i boot up multiplayer shark cards oh lord what the  r some shady stuff done by r recently like the price thing during the summer sale i could add more to the list but i dont want the review to be a complete cluster p despite shortcomings id recommend this game to any fan of grand theft auto
recommended
its like gta v with guns
recommended
i recomend only for the first person pov players need to stop thinking every multiplayer game has to be like dayz which includes killing people cause you have the ability to higher level and more experienced players get better stuff and use that against newer players not fun
